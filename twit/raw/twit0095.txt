[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.960]   And a very good day to you, Leo Leport here, and it is this weekend tech.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.840]   I have to correct my numbering from the last episode.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.520]   This is episode 95.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.800]   No, it was at 96.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.240]   No, it's 95.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760]   I said last time it was 95.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.480]   Thank you, CB.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.320]   CB's in our chat room.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.800]   It is 95.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.240]   I said last time it was 95.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   It was 95.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.480]   Anyway, it's a new Twit.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.800]   And let me introduce the Twits around the table.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.240]   John C. Devorak is here/blog.org.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.720]   No, no, no, no.

[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.440]   Come on.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.800]   Thank you.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   Also, Doc Serals is back.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.240]   We're glad to have you, Doc.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.600]   Yeah, glad to be here, too.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   What plug should I give you today?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800]   I don't need one.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800]   He's at the Berkman Center, of course.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   I could probably use some hair plugs, actually.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   I'll give you a doc.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   I'm how about that.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   Part of the Berkman Center is also in the Southern California.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   Is it UCSB you're teaching?
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   UCSB.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   I've got something going there, too.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   That's great.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   I'm under the academic stage of my life.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   Whatever that means.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   Most of the most of us go through that at the beginning.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   I'm going through it at I, but I hope it isn't quite the end.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.200]   I'm going back to my 30th college reunion at the end of the month, and I'm dreading it.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   Just dreading it.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   Oh.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.800]   You'll see accountants and other people with things to sell.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   Really?
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   Is that what people do?
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   Do they go there and sell stuff?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   That's my experience.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   That was my experience early on, like the 10th, 15th.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.560]   Should I bring like Twit hats and try to peddle them?
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   That's a good idea.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.080]   The propellers would be good.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.160]   All I remember I used to bar 10 at the reunions when I was in school, and all I remember
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.080]   is just a lot of drinking.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   Heavy.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.080]   What school was that?
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.240]   It was Yale known for its heavy drinking.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.240]   And presidents.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.080]   And many presidents who also drank heavily.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.280]   Yeah, we have the last three, don't we?
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   Me.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   Me.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   So we eat a weed.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280]   Will you just go in bones?
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   No, I was not in bones.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.480]   Well, if I were it, I'd have to get up and leave right now.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   You know that.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.480]   Probably.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.560]   It's lucky that you're lucky that I'm not.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.440]   Alex Lindsey is here just back from Las Vegas and NAB.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.800]   Alex traveled to Vegas.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.360]   Get this ladies and personal bartender.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.680]   I like to, you know, when you're talking about drinking, I like to take my own personal
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   bartender with me.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   Can you believe that?
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   Is that wacky?
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680]   We're not joking.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.680]   Alberta went with him.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.040]   So, Alberta from Cocktails on the Fly came out.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.520]   We did a little get together, which was a lot of fun.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.520]   Apparently.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   You missed it, Leo.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520]   The best party at NAB.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.960]   And I'm sorry I had to go to Vancouver instead.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.760]   Also from across the pond and willharris.co.uk will Harris himself.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   One L, please.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760]   Hello.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   In his jamming.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   Because it's up late and Alex is asleep.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   Alex.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   Yes, it's Alex.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   Your girlfriend's Alex.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.760]   Yes.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   As opposed to Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   Lovely.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   Yes.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.000]   I don't think I've slept with Alex Lindsey as far as I know.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Not yet.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Any minute.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.640]   Take in my breath away.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.840]   I'm telling you.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   We are also.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   You guys.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.720]   I'm streaming this for the first time.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.760]   We've used talk shoe in the past to stream audio.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.880]   And now I'm streaming video and audio, which is really wacky.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.800]   Unfortunately, I hadn't had time to get the principals to set up their own streams.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.960]   But Janna and Will and Alex and Doc, I think in future, it's a very simple thing to do.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.280]   You stream just uses flash to capture any webcam.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.760]   So in fact, we could have, and I would love to do this, a page of all of us and people
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   could sit, watch the page and watch all of us.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   And really.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.360]   I think that's kind of screw up the Skype connection a little bit.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   I'm using it right now.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   It doesn't seem to be making.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   But you're sitting on a big pipe.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   It's no way.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.680]   It's a single understands a single flash stream.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.600]   I mean, they're doing all the other streams.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.720]   We have 221 people in the chatroom 75 live video viewers.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.160]   I think it's a very interesting idea.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.480]   Anyway, we'll play with this in future.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.680]   Be a way to do a video.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.040]   Twit without ever having to leave our homes, which is frankly our dream.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.120]   I don't think it's a dream of Alex's.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   Alex travels.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   When are you going to Africa?
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   I leave next week.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120]   All right.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   So this is the last Twitter one.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   Let's start with the somber story.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.880]   But the big story, you couldn't get away from all week long, which is of course the
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.480]   shootings at Virginia Tech.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.040]   I'd like to establish a ground rule.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.440]   I don't want to mention the name of the bad guy.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   Refer to him.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.760]   I just think that's to me, I was disappointed by all the coverage he got.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.720]   He was on the cover of everything.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.360]   And to me, that's just an asking to.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.920]   So by establishing this ground rule, you expect the guy's name to be forgotten.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   I mean, I don't understand.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   No, it won't be.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.000]   I just don't want to be party to it.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's just a shame.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.880]   I think it encourages copycats.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.200]   That's why people do it for that kind of attention.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.920]   So this was a controversy guy I got caught up in because Dave Weiner, myself, Jeff Jarvis
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.960]   and some others thought that the right thing for NBC to have done with police is just put
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.360]   it all up on the web and say, here it is.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.120]   Here's what the guy gave us.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.360]   I've not put it on TV.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.000]   Well, put it on TV, but do it on it.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.200]   In other words, not hold it and use it only for their own purposes and then sit on it for
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   the duration.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.440]   So you guys have never worked in broadcasting.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   I take it.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   Oh, yes, I have worked.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   I know exactly why they did it.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.440]   That's the best pressure to do.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440]   I mean, it's very important.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.280]   I think there was another point of view.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   I thought it was a better point of view.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.520]   Yeah, but what you're saying is that you've got some idealistic thing now that you're not
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.080]   working there and you're, would you really expect in a million years at the end of the
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.400]   year, these guys would ever follow that kind of thinking.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.840]   No, I would actually.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.800]   But well, maybe if the public demand, if there were enough pain in doing it, they'd
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   never get a demand.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   They want this cover.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   Well, that's why they do it, isn't it?
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   Because the public wants to see it.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.280]   This was this guy was multimedia savvy.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.280]   He sent them audio.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   He sent them video.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.280]   He sent them stills.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   It was almost a press kit, he said.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.800]   It's ridiculous, but Leo, do you remember the years when you were at MSNBC doing the
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.640]   site and that was the reason the site was was dropped from MSNBC's line.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.240]   In fact, the entire theory of the network was changed because of the 24/7 coverage of
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.720]   the Diana death that took place during the little NBC.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720]   Absolutely right.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   That's what killed it.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.440]   And they said they took a look at the numbers and they took a look at the site numbers and
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.840]   they said, well, screw that.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.040]   You guys are out.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   Yep.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.600]   Halsey Minor, very famously, the guy who started CNET said, "You've got an audience the size
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.840]   of a middling high school," which was probably true.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.880]   And as soon as Diana died and they went to wall-to-wall coverage, their numbers, by
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.440]   the way, they haven't had numbers that good since.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.960]   They needed a nude princess every few years, I guess.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.160]   But that is still depressing.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.320]   And I tell you, when I see his picture on the, I have to say, people, magazines was the
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.680]   one that put the victim on the cover, not him.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.160]   One of the reasons it's important for us, of course, is we had many listeners at Virginia
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.520]   Tech.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.920]   It was an engineering school.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   They have this.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.160]   Right, but can I add one more thing since I'm on a roll here?
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.160]   Mr. Media.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.760]   It seemed to me that they never gave, you know, there's one hero in this story that Israeli
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.320]   professor who like blocked the doors and saved those kids from shared death and got killed.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   And he was like a guy who was in the...
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   Holocaust.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.120]   Holocaust survivor.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.680]   And this guy has gotten, once in a while he gets mentioned, you know, rarely.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.800]   He wasn't mentioned in the convocation.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   It was just...
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   Really?
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   It was the hero of the story.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   Well, he is the hero.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   But it was like, you know, let's go back and show more grisly details and forget this
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   character.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   No, I agree.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   He was... that was a remarkable story of heroism.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.400]   Anyway, that's my two cents.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   I agree with you.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.480]   You know, the coverage I saw and I tried to avoid it because it was just too grueling
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.800]   to watch.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   He was...
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   CNN... I think it was on CNN.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.880]   He was, they told his story of his life and the so forth.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.400]   But maybe not as much as the other guy got.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:42.200]   So, Doc, why is it that you think NBC should have put it on the net all at once?
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   Public's right to know?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.720]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.440]   And I think that there are many points of view on this and all of them have some merit.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.840]   And I think John's right that, you know, they would have done what they would have done
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.560]   as a broadcasting organization.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:07.440]   But the assumption that the only authorities that are qualified to look at this are theirs
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.000]   is too narrow and false.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.080]   I think that there's... it isn't a matter of the public's right to know.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.560]   It's understanding what this guy as best we possibly can.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:26.240]   And my feeling, and we have no way of testing this really, is that more deaths will be prevented
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   by understanding serial killers that best we possibly can than will be produced by copy
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.440]   cadding, which you don't need that much more detail to do.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:43.360]   So the interesting thing to me about that though is not so much that the... that particular
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.080]   point of view, but how little discussion has actually happened around it.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   That's actually useful.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.000]   I mean, of all the things that I do that might be useful and might not be useful, I feel
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.800]   like one of the most useless I did was express that opinion, even though it got me an NPR.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.400]   A number of people agreed with me.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.160]   A few people disagreed with me.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.080]   But I didn't hear a lot of discussion about it.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.080]   It just hardly happened.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.480]   It was like I got condemned for having the opinion and encouraging copycat killers.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.240]   And a few people said, yeah, he's right, maybe.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.960]   But nothing... no difference will be made.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.440]   I think that, you know, one of the things that discovered, you know, seven, eight years
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.760]   into it, is that there are things that blogging and speaking out are good for and there are
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.840]   things they are less good for.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   And this seemed to be like one of the less good for examples.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.840]   In other words, I think I had an opinion.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.040]   It was maybe worth something.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.440]   It didn't make any difference at all.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.560]   And it sucked up a lot of my time, which is sort of an interesting thing too.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.360]   VT.edu is the website.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.440]   There is a book of condolences and I would love it if a Twit listeners would go there
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.960]   and write something in there.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.800]   And you know, I have the computer that's in your room, Danny, is from Virginia Tech.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.560]   It was from the Tera Skill Computing Project there.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.600]   They had the supercomputer out of Macintoshes.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.840]   And when they took it apart to put X-Servs or X, whatever, you know, the one you computer
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.600]   is in there, I bought that.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   It has a...
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.400]   Yeah, I have a certificate from VT and everything.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.240]   Anyway, I know we have a lot of listeners there in our hearts and prayers.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.800]   Thoughts go out to you.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   Just a tragedy.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.080]   Anything else anybody wants to say about it?
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.240]   I'll tell you one thing I would like to bring up and will I like to get your opinion of it?
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.560]   Dr. Phil says it's because of violent video games.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.320]   Well, yeah, Dr. Phil being the authority on everything.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.560]   There's pretty much conclusive evidence that he barely played many computer games like he
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.560]   once.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.280]   Maybe he was saying, I'm going to give him the benefit of the dad that it's a violent
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.720]   culture that causes something like that.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.840]   I mean, there was no evidence that video games were involved at all.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.280]   He had no video game.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.440]   The shooter had no video games in his possession.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.080]   I mean, there was no video games anywhere near this.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   And I think that...
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.760]   I don't want to say refreshing because the wrong thing to say.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.920]   But I mean, it's nice not to have video games made the escape.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   Right.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   This all the time.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   Right.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.240]   Am I wrong or did he bought him a hammer or an eBay, did he not?
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   He did.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.320]   It was not only to get the guns very easily, to pawn shop across the street, but yeah,
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   he needed hollow point bullets.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   Guess where?
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.560]   I thought eBay had banned that.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.440]   I don't think you can buy weapons.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440]   I think you can buy them.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   Just the bullets.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.040]   You can buy bullets everywhere.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   It's not a big deal.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.200]   You can buy bullets in Walmart.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.640]   Yeah, you can't go or came or two.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.520]   I think maybe they don't sell them anymore.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:39.720]   Whatever the case is, I think this thing Dr. Phil did with the video game thing was really
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.880]   incredibly insincere and in borderline six.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   Cynical.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   And totally cynical.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.720]   I mean, it's unbelievable that he would open himself up.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.800]   I'm surprised, you know, the bloggers haven't gone after him seriously with this nonsense.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.200]   It's ludicrous.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.720]   Well, I mean, it is, it is patently ludicrous.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.080]   And I guess the only thing you could say is, well, maybe if he's criticizing a violent
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.920]   culture, but it's not video games.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.400]   And as you, you know, you criticize the Iraq war than why you're at it.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   Right.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   Good point.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   All right.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   Moving on.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:20.480]   Alex Lindsey, Apple made some big announcements in terms of Final Cut Pro 2, which is that?
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.480]   Yeah, there was soon.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   Yeah, there were, there were a few big announcements.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.960]   I mean, there were a few big things there.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.560]   I mean, there was a lot of the same.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.760]   I mean, there's 90% of any beat doesn't really change from year to year.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.840]   And you get usually a handful of things.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.040]   The Apple releasing app Final Cut Pro Studio 2 was a, was big in the production area.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.480]   You can see that they're really focusing on, they're focusing heavily on getting into news
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.760]   rooms, getting into larger organizations with Final Cut server, which lets people really
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.720]   automate and lets a lot of, a lot of people integrate with each other.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.880]   Color is a brand new application.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.240]   They actually bought a company called Silicon Color last year.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.960]   And it is a color correction tool.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.520]   This kind of stuff is normally cost, you know, it can cost as much as half a million dollars.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.560]   And they're just bundling it in with, with the new, it's a pretty, it's a pretty scary
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.440]   thing actually for other people doing this kind of stuff.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.640]   But other people who are doing this kind of stuff.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   Oh, other, other people.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   It's good for fun.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.560]   You know, who's also scared is Sony because the red camera finally made its debut.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.160]   Although you told me they're only going to be able to make one red a week.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.320]   Well, they actually, the schedule has the first 200.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.200]   It's one a week maybe in May, you know, late April and early May, but the schedule, some
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.680]   of our members, we've got about 15 members who have are on the list of red buyers.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:45.200]   And I think 200 in the one, we have one that's at 230 and I think he's in July.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.640]   So it'll accelerate.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.560]   They're just slowly trickling out.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.960]   Why is red such an important deal?
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.600]   Well, it's actually, you know, what's fascinating about red is what you have is this guy, you
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.920]   know, besides loves cameras and decides everyone's, no one's doing it right and everyone's charging
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.480]   too much and he can do it, he can do it better.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.840]   And everyone thought that he was absolutely insane when he started and now he's producing
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.760]   cameras at, and to give you an idea that they have what they call 4K cameras.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:19.160]   So it's over 4000 pixels wide every frame up to 60 frames a second.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.480]   So that's twice the resolution and frame rate of HDTV?
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.120]   Yeah, technically it's four times as many pixels, but yeah, it's twice the, twice the
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.080]   way it's four times pixels.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   Wow.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   Right.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.800]   And so it is an enormous amount of data.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.200]   And, but they've also found great ways to compress it down so that you can capture it
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.400]   on a hard drive that's connected to the camera.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.480]   You can capture directly to, you know, through Final Cut onto your, onto your computer and
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480]   it's still usable.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.280]   I mean, because the other, the other problem with 4K is uncompressed.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.720]   It's 1.5 gigabits per second, you know, and so it might be even more than that actually.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.160]   So I think it's actually, yeah, so it's, it's a lot of data.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.280]   All right, 1.5 gigabytes a second.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.760]   That's, that's what that's going to be.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.920]   A second.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.360]   A second uncompressed.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.000]   Now what they've done is they figured out a whole bunch of ways to make it a lot smaller
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.160]   than that, to make it a lot less, you know, to compress that.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.360]   The thing is, is that you have all these companies like Panasonic and Sony and even Canon who
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.840]   have these high end cameras, Sony's camera high end film camera or the Dalsa, all these
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.760]   other ones are, you know, quarter million, half a million dollars, you know, at least
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.320]   150,000.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.160]   And you got this camera, the red camera coming in at 17,500 for the body.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.720]   Now that may seem, seem like a lot for a prosumer camera.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.200]   It's not a consumer or even, I'm not even a prosumer camera at that price.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   It's a pro camera.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.280]   Now the other thing that they said though, that everyone got excited about is they said
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.840]   they're going to make a professional pocket camera and they won't tell us any, anything
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.880]   else other than it'll be professional and it'll fit in your pocket.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   Wow.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.080]   You know, and that's going to be, but that won't be a thousand dollar camera.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.680]   You know, most likely it'll be less than, most of us are guessing it'll be less than
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   10,000.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.760]   And the thing is, is that it's not, as I said, as a consumer, this doesn't really affect
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.600]   you that much except for the fact that all these podcasters moving towards wanting to
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:13.200]   do film quality work or TV quality work or so on and so forth are going to be armed with
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.680]   a lot of this high, a lot of these higher end tools.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:21.560]   Can we, can we stop here for a second and just back off and go back to the one camera
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.840]   a week thing that he mentioned earlier?
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.840]   Okay.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:30.320]   Sounds like a running advertisement for these guys and if they're, and now promising a,
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.880]   I'm not seeing, you know, what, that 200 out, 200 out by the, by the end of July.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.880]   That's what they're saying.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.240]   So it's still mass production.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.320]   Well, no, well, why don't you get into that part of the story?
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.400]   How come they can't produce them more?
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.280]   I mean, it seems to me that once you get the whole idea down, you should be able to crank
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.040]   them out unless they're being handmade by, you know, one guy.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.000]   Well, I think the first ones are just, you know, these are, they are a, a, a, a camera
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   ever made.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   It's a new chip.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   It's a new, they want to make sure that the quality is really high.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.080]   I wonder if the chip yields are a problem.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   I wonder if there's a chip.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   What do these things, what do these things, what do these things, what do they do?
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.160]   They have to do using kind of screws with reverse threads.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.080]   I mean, what's different about it?
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.480]   No, it's got to be something like the chip yields are very low.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.480]   It's got to be something like that.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.360]   To put the, you're talking about 200, the chip yields aren't low.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360]   They're ridiculously low.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.840]   You can't even make a chip with 200 copies.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   It's got to be in the.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.800]   I just want to, I just want to put this in perspective though.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.640]   Iona, you know, the Picsacore has a Sony F950.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:31.960]   This is a, you know, digital film camera and 150 of them ever made.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.320]   So because there was no market, but now at 17 grand, there might be a little bit of a
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.400]   larger market for them.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.200]   And there's, there's already, there's already over 1500 people on the waiting list for the
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   camera.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.560]   But, but still, I, I think John does raise an interesting question.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.680]   Why can't they wrap this stuff up?
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.240]   Well, it's, you know, the thing that you have to be careful of is you can do a lot of
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.120]   them and you can do them really fast if you spend a hundred million dollars on a fab.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.920]   You know, you, you, what do you need a special fab for?
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.560]   Fabs are for making chips for, for, from scratch.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.560]   I mean, what do you need a fab?
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.120]   We need an assembly line.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.440]   These are not, these are not, these are shipped, these are chips from scratch.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.400]   These are not anything that anyone else is selling.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   They develop.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   Well, somebody has to make this chip, Alex.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.000]   I mean, it's just they don't come in out of the blue.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   They're made at a fab now.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.320]   For, I mean, they'll make just 200 chips.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.560]   I can tell you that.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.560]   I understand.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.320]   I think that they are moving towards an assembly line.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.040]   The main thing you want to do is maintain, maintain also quality, you know, and so.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   Solve the story sounds fishy.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.040]   I'm curious with John.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   Where do they make them?
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.640]   That's a, for, far as I know.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.280]   You know, they, they're pretty, they're pretty secret about the whole thing.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.280]   The.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.440]   This is what I will sell the bag.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.960]   Everyone, I'm telling you.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.560]   Everyone said that this smelled bad and everyone worried about it and literally last year,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.040]   they got the best of NAB and they hadn't even, they had a balsa wood camera.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.480]   Well, nobody believed it and was there at NAB.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.440]   In fact, uh, yeah, balsa wood.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440]   Come on.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.240]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, last week was there.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.360]   Peter Jackson shot with it, right?
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.880]   He made, he made a film with it.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.760]   So what happened was is that what scared everyone last week was the fact that Peter
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.120]   Jackson borrowed two of the cameras that are now done.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.440]   I think they have a six or seven of them completed and he borrowed it, took it out and shot
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.320]   a 12 minute film with it and it looks gorgeous and he's super happy with it.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.040]   And it's, you know, so the thing is, is that it is a, uh, that's what's everyone thought.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.880]   Everyone could really talk about how, oh, you know, this is, this is all being else,
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.880]   but now the cameras are starting to come out.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.520]   So is there, is that Peter Jackson footage?
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.040]   Anyway, is this some where we can see the Peter Jackson film and whether or not Peter
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.360]   Jackson shot with this thing.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.560]   I mean, I remember the days where you used to see these really great computers at these
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   trade shows.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.320]   And then if you actually looked underneath, you'd find a cable running to a big super
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.000]   computer in the back someplace.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.200]   How do we know that the Peter Jackson camera that he was using wasn't some one off, you
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.800]   know, $250,000 unit that was just being said to be this, this camera you're describing.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.280]   Is there any, did he tear it apart to look at it?
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   I mean, come on.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.200]   You know, the thing is, is that I think that what you're going to find is that there's
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   going to be a lot of people with them, April, May, May, June, July, and we'll get, we'll
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   hear a lot more from them.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.240]   I think that it is a, it's a, it, it really is.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.160]   If you look at the camera, if you look at the data that it has to deal with, if you,
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   all of this stuff is an order of magnitude larger than, than definitely any other camera
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.480]   under $100,000, you know, so what they're doing is making it affordable and making it,
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.640]   you know, that high, high quality is something that is very complicated.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.640]   John, maybe the fact that the chip is named the Mysterium chip will help answer all of
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640]   these questions.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   I don't know.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.400]   You know, Alex, when I, when I hear you rave like this about that camera, I'm all I'm
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.960]   thinking because since you run a business is wish, is that you're exhibiting like extreme
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.920]   amounts of wishful thinking.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.720]   I will say that I, you know, I'm usually on your side when, when we do swim, when we
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:50.040]   do this, we can media Emory Wells who has, who's got an order for one of these things,
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.920]   is you know, like talks like me and I have to kind of try to bring him down and say,
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.440]   well, et cetera, but the truth of the matter is after looking at the camera, after looking
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.040]   at, at what it's doing at, they're looking at frames that are coming out of it after
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.120]   talking to a lot of people who have had hands on experience with it.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.640]   Cause it's not just Peter Jackson.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.280]   There's other people that have been, have gotten a chance to use it at the ASC, which
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.000]   is the American Society of cinematographers.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   A lot of people are really impressed.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Well, this is interesting.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.320]   We'll know, we'll know by June or July, right?
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.920]   I mean, as these start to come out.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   And we'll find out.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.520]   When I get back from Africa, we'll have another conversation about it and we'll look
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   at it.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.280]   Now the, the, the only other thing I think was really notable from NAB was the release
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.760]   of Silverlight and also the Adobe Media Player.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.160]   This is Microsoft really, really Silverlight and then Adobe released the Adobe Media Player.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:43.760]   These are adding tons of interactivity and development to video, to video streams, which
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.960]   I think is going to be a big deal as we go into next year.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:51.920]   So, Silverlight is, is the attempt to what take over from QuickTime and Windows Media
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   Player?
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.920]   I mean, it's a lot of what they're trying to do.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.920]   I mean, what do you laugh at?
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.400]   Let's just take over Windows Media Player.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   No problem.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   Now Adobe has some standing in this area.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.560]   I mean, Flash is dominant.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.760]   What are you, what are you, what are you using right now?
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.960]   And for you, Stream, it's Flash.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.720]   I think that it's going to be interesting to see how effective Adobe is at it.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.000]   And it's also going to be interesting to see how much Apple reacts.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.240]   The ironic thing is Apple's had most of the tools that they're talking about in Silverlight
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.640]   and Adobe Media Player for maybe the last eight years.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.720]   These interactivity tools you're talking about.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.880]   I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll click on images and so forth.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   Exactly.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.720]   They just don't have, they, they haven't had a good tool for people to actually, you
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.640]   know, build stuff with it, you know, and it's all sitting inside a quick time.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.400]   And so it's a challenging thing, but I think because Flash is so successful, I think that
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.800]   people will certainly pay attention if nothing else.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.760]   Well, all of this stuff, it's not so much something that's going to be something you're
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.000]   going to see every day this year, but I think as you move into the middle of 2008, interactivity
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.880]   on the web is going to interactivity on, on net apps.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.240]   So non-web page just standalone apps, I think is going to become a really big deal.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.480]   And I think this is just the beginning of that, that process.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.400]   I just want to mention that Will Harris wins the geek award for being the first member
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.800]   of the Twit panel panel to get you stream up and running.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.480]   And people are now watching you at the same time as they are.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.040]   So, so, sitting in my bathroom, this, this, this dream is, I think I want people to see
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   me today.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   This dream is possible.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.720]   This dream can come true.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.400]   We could all be sat in living rooms doing Twit.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.120]   I guess we can embed the, I guess we can embed all, all five of the channels to a page.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   That's what, that's what I'll do.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.120]   I'll do that.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.840]   Alex, could you sort it out so that you could green screen it so that if we all get the
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.080]   stream, we can make it look like we're all sitting in a table?
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.000]   I think that there's some possibility of that.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.960]   And then if you should do some tests, if you should it with a red camera, then it'll
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.760]   be like we're in your room.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.720]   Actually, you know what, there's actually some software that we could use that would
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.080]   let you actually upload it.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.600]   Then we really would look like we're all in the same room.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.360]   I see Callie Lewis in our chat room and she's just, she's dying to get a red camera.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.960]   So I think that, you know, we'll see.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   It'd be very interesting to see.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.080]   By the way, let me add one more question about the red camera.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.040]   Do you have to put a deposit down on this thing?
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   You do.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.760]   It's a thousand dollars to get on the list.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.840]   And a thousand dollars to get on the list and they, it's 100% refundable if you ever
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.840]   want to get off the list.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   You'll have to go bankrupt.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   Is it refundable then?
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   Well, I don't know.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.080]   I mean, the guy who started the company's worth over a billion dollars.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.080]   I don't think that.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.240]   I know, but it doesn't mean he's, he may be, he's not.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.760]   That's how you get to be worth a billion dollars.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.800]   You don't, he's not responsible for the money.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.360]   I mean, it's like a corporate thing.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.960]   I just have to say that I was a naysayer a year ago and when I, there were lines literally
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.760]   outside the red booth, the, from the, from the literally with intent minutes after the
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.760]   thing goes through.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   It's the iPhone for video games.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.760]   It really is.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.760]   It is.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.760]   It is.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.760]   It's really a phone either.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   So it's going to be.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.760]   So it's going to be.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760]   Okay.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.760]   Hey, that's fine with me.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   I hope that I hope it's a winner.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   So I'll get one.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   We'll shoot a twit with it once, once we have.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   Absolutely.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   I think it's, it's, you know, I'm going to take your side, Alex.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.760]   This thing is a solid win.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.760]   I'm sending them a thousand dollars.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.760]   I'm going to take your side.

[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.760]   I'm going to take your side.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.760]   Doesn't that seem like Sunday night stuff?
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.760]   Usually Saturday night, Sunday night.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.760]   Yeah, that's usually the more common time.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   I agree.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   Maybe it needed to happen on Tuesday night.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.760]   It was an emergency.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760]   Yeah, that's what it was.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   It was something going on that they weren't talking about.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   Something bad happened.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.760]   Right.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.760]   Apple plugs 25 OS 1025.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.760]   OS 10 flaws this week.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.760]   I hope you ran your system update.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   It's going to get...
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.760]   Why do you say that?
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   Well, it's because they've given up on the OS 10.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   It seems to me they're going to often spend all their time on this iPhone thing.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   And that's the end of Apple.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   Well, did we get a lot of hate mail from you?
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   We got so much hate mail for last week's episode because we said that.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.760]   But I think that that's true.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.760]   I don't understand why.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.760]   Why do people say, "Why would somebody send hate mail?
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.760]   They haven't even got an iPhone.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.760]   They haven't bought an iPhone.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.760]   They haven't looked at an iPhone.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   They haven't poked at an iPhone.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   They haven't done anything with an iPhone.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   So what difference does it make what anybody thinks about it?
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   Because no one has actually seen the thing.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   John Gruber, the big guy.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.760]   He's seen the thing.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.760]   John Gruber, very defensive and as usual of Apple.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.760]   And John's a nice guy.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.760]   But he said, "Well, no, no, they're just...
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:39.760]   But first of all, if it's a big company, they don't have enough engineers to share between an operating system and a phone.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.760]   And second of all, people were saying, "Well, it's both OS 10.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.760]   I don't see it."
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   Apple calls it OS 10 on the iPhone.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.760]   Well, they've never been Nokia before.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.760]   They're new to that.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.760]   I like what the onion said, which is Apple's already working on absolutely leading the iPhone.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   That's what they said.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   They're putting all their energy on.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.760]   You send your hate mail to the onion, folks.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   It's all their fault.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   I'm looking forward to the iPhone shuffle, which says one button.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.760]   You don't know who it's going to call.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.760]   Oh, that's good.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   That just calls people to random.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.760]   But as a reference to the one it kills, whoever you call.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   If anybody gets that one.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   It's like the one.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.760]   But did you see the MacBook that got hacked this week for like, what was it?
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.760]   $10,000 of security conference.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.760]   Now, it was a zero-day explain safari.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   It was used cross-site scripting.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.760]   Ah, yeah.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.760]   Which is if you're a security now, you'll know all about.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   Yeah, it's funny because we have been talking about cross-site scripting in the last three episodes of security now.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.760]   It's your fault, Leo.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.760]   You're just listening to your podcast.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   And I just went on $10,000.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.760]   $10,000 is yours, Leo.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   Oh, my money.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   But we're going to class.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.760]   You should have it.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.760]   It just should give Leo a finder's fee at least for a brand.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.760]   But it just does show you that all of the, and I'm one of them, all of the Apple fanatics who have been saying, oh, not us.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   We're safer.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   It's, maybe it's giving some credence to the, which is you're not safer.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   It's just nobody's paying attention to Apple.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.760]   If hackers attack it, it's just as vulnerable as anybody else.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.760]   Agree or disagree, please discuss.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   I agree.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.760]   I think that's true with that.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.760]   How much sport is there in it?
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   I guess that's the point.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.760]   Yeah, that's the point.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.760]   Is it sport or is it money?
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   How much money?
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   It's taking candy from a baby.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   That's too easy.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   Too damn easy.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   Although we learned that Vista is going to get its first service pack thanks to Paul Audelini, Intel's head slipped that Vista will get its first service pack in the October/November timeframe.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.760]   Now it's time to buy.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   That's a triggering mechanism for a lot of people waiting for SP1.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.760]   So now what that means in October/November, you buy?
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:49.760]   Yeah, and I think by then you also have those hybrid hard disks that I'm seeing to be the only one talking about.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.760]   It's the red camera Vista.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.760]   Well, maybe.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.760]   Everyone's got their devices.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.760]   Someday all hard drives will be made like this.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.760]   Microsoft has been saying there's no update coming.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.760]   Ballmer says I have no knowledge of any Microsoft any service.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   What an idiot.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.760]   Maybe he does this now.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   It's perfect.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   Yeah, we don't need to fix that.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.760]   He has no knowledge.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   What is he talking about?
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   You know what's interesting?
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.760]   Dell has this, I have no knowledge.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   Dell has this thing they do called idea storm where they ask customers to give them feedback on new products, new ideas.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.760]   13,000.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.760]   Do them.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.760]   Please.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.760]   Let us buy XP on our home systems.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.760]   Did you see what the top 10 requests were for?
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.760]   No.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   They were all for open source things.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:54.760]   They're all for Linux of one kind or another or something with Firefox or having Penguin as well as a Windows tattoo on the laptop.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   Is that really just mob the Linux?
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.760]   No, I don't think it's the same few people.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   They really is demand for that.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   The question is it's thousands and not millions, but it's still a significant few thousand.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:15.760]   There's a hole in the marketplace, I think right now below Apple and alongside Windows as a competitor.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   There really is a hole there.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   Do you think it's telling that Michael Dell admitted that on his home computer he's running Ubuntu Feisty Fall?
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   He's not admitted.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.760]   It's on their site.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   It's on their site.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.760]   Here's what Michael's going to the Linux Journal site.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   I put it up there.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   I copied it.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   It's his primary home machine and Ubuntu laptop.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   It's in their corporate bio.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   So, is that just to be like a bit of street cred?
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   Yeah, me too.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   I'm seriously using it.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.760]   Well, it may also be a little dig in the general direction of Redmond as well.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   Well, if you're reading the tea leaves, you can see the little divorce claim on there.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:57.760]   Sure, you can see the fractures between Intel and Microsoft over this service pack one, and now fractures between Dell and Microsoft.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   The Intel fracture has been really obvious for a long time.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.760]   The Dell fracture has been, I think, is this is the first time I've seen it in a really clear way.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   It's coming.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.760]   And meanwhile...
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   I think that's what they put up idea storm.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.760]   I think they wanted to say to Microsoft, "Hey, look, here's what the market wants."
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.760]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.760]   That's a good idea.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   Meanwhile, AMD losing $611 million in the first quarter.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   Out.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   I want to find that.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   Where are they?
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   Where are they losing?
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   Let's get a search card into that.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   I think it's in the sofa, but I may be wrong.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   It could be some quarters down there.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   I don't know.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   That's a lot of money.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.760]   It's crazy.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   I mean, that is an absolute ton.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.000]   And there are a lot of people that are saying that AMD cash injection just to get through
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   this year.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.440]   Oh, they've got a story.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.800]   The financial aid you have is that they have two quarters left to recover.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.360]   Or they're going to be out.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   Is the ATI?
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   Yeah, because they sense.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   Part of the problem?
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   I mean, wow.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   No, no.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.360]   The problem is that Intel is pushing them really, really hard on pricing.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   They've actually got better products now.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   So nobody wants to buy AMD's.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   So to get any chip sold at all, AMD's just got to absolutely slash them.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   And that's why they're losing so much.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   Well, in fact, they announced 50% price cuts almost across the board.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   Yeah, which is a good example.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   Time for users to think about building some extra machines at home.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   Yeah, everybody just buying AMD chip just to keep them alive.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   Well, you know, to lose that much money.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.360]   I mean, they lost $600 million on a revenue of $1.2 billion.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.360]   That's hard work.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:37.720]   You know, Intel is also putting a lot of work into channel development of all kind, getting
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.040]   them all over, not just on price, but in relationships.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.760]   They've got huge relationships going everywhere.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.960]   And I'm not sure that that AMD can scale to compete with that.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.480]   It's not merely pricing in channels though.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   It's also technology.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.320]   You point out, well, you've been benchmarking Penren the new 45 nanometers.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.320]   You're a chip.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.640]   Do you say in the Nama?
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   In the Nama meter?
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.040]   No, we say nano meter.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   OK, just checking.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.160]   I have an actually, no, I haven't actually benchmarked it.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:10.760]   It was just the guys, the guys in the office had checked it out and said it was pretty good.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   Calamity.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   Pretty swank.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   Really?
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   So they think it's running well.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.600]   Any ball parts?
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   It's fast.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:23.960]   They've got some numbers and stuff there, but it's, you know, it's what you'd expect.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.640]   It's core to you, you take into the next level.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.040]   Also, the word is that it's sweet.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.800]   The word is that it's going to take AMD at least a year to get to 45.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.600]   So they're just way in mind now.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.600]   Well, if they've only got two corners.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.600]   Because they're only just moving to 65.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.080]   It's not good.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:46.520]   Yeah, and I don't know if the ATI, you know, pickup was really the best thing either because
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.080]   NVIDIA is also hitting it on all cylinders at the moment.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.000]   And from a developer's point of view, I can say that it's much easier for us to develop
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   for.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.520]   For a while, there was some talk of Intel and NVIDIA joining hands.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.760]   Anything along those lines?
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.760]   Any rumors?
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.160]   They were close at one point in time to...
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.800]   The thing is, is that ironically NVIDIA was working very, very closely with AMD.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.720]   For a long time, if you went to a graphics conference, you would almost always see them
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.920]   sharing some part of a booth.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.680]   And you know, really, really worked a little bit of a...
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:23.600]   I think that they really felt a little slightly backstabbed when AMD went the other direction.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.040]   But I think that NVIDIA I think is producing superior boards at the moment.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:33.120]   And it's the way it handles the graphics is a lot more straightforward from a professional
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:47.640]   and I don't know about for games.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   I don't really deal with that area very much.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:04.020]   I guess my question is how many times do we have to prove that these people are blowing up people
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.740]   never mind if they get a nuclear weapon?
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.900]   When do we send them an airmail message to Tehran?
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.040]   And here's John McCain's response.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:22.480]   That was a question that, uh -- that old beach boy sung "Bom meringue."
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.320]   Bam mam.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.160]   Dang, man.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.220]   The idea doesn't sing it very much.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.580]   I thought he was going to sing more.
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.580]   They deleted it by accident.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.920]   Oh, is that what it was?
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   By accident.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   By accident.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.760]   Well, you know, the thing was it was posted more than once and so anyone, like I had it
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.700]   on my blog, the original one, that it got deleted.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.520]   And so I just found like another copy, which was also on YouTube and posted it.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.520]   Well, that's the point.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.520]   It's like whack-a-mole.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.520]   You can't delete anything.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.520]   Totally like whack-a-mole.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.560]   So was it deleted because the beach boys complained?
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.560]   Well he probably had to pay an ass-gap to sing that one line.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.300]   You know, the original song, let's be -- the original song is by the regents.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.540]   So let's find the regents to see if they come back.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.540]   Is that right?
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.540]   Is that right?
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.540]   Yeah, the regents.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.900]   The regents had the original song and the beach boys song was recorded at the party.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:13.700]   Um -- Well, no, but wasn't the -- the other guy, the two guys that were the surf singers
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.300]   down at, uh, what's their name?
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.300]   Janet Dean.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   Janet Dean.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.300]   Didn't they do it first?
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.300]   No, I don't think so.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.300]   I think the regents did.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   Pop, pop, pop.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.940]   And then Janet Dean did it made it -- Janet Dean was the one that made it a hit.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.940]   It was the beach --
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.520]   The beach boys -- well the regents had a hit and I think it was like 1960, '61.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.800]   And the beach boys, I think, had -- had the next hit with it was about 1964.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.400]   I could look it up, but I'd have to use my keyboard to solve that.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.800]   One other time I'd blog it, well look, it was figured out later.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.680]   One suggestion though is that it's politically motivated.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.760]   It was -- it was -- it was pulled down because it was political.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.760]   Could be.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.040]   It was pulled down to be put back up.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.560]   The whole thing could be a scam.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.560]   [ Laughter ]
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.560]   It's just a city.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.380]   It's all about -- it's what -- 10, 90 percent of the things are just about publicity.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.140]   It's all about incompetence most of the time.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.140]   Most of the time.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.980]   Yeah, I mean, in fact, all of these takedowns on YouTube.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.780]   And never ascribe to malice we can be explained by incompetence.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.780]   Like that.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.780]   It's that --
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.100]   We'll call that Doc Serrel's razor.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.100]   [ Laughter ]
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.900]   Serrel's sixth law.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.300]   My first law, my kid said that -- I said this the other day and he liked it so much
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.940]   he said it needed to do my first law, which is the more you know, the worse you look.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.940]   [ Laughter ]
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.940]   Well, I must know a lot.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.940]   That's a good one.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.240]   That must be so smart.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.880]   You know, I think it's funny that the -- a lot of us talk about Big Brother and I think
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.360]   we are having -- you know, we have issues around that.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.280]   But we also have Little Brother, which is us looking back at the government.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.720]   And it's so amazing how often you're seeing this comp where someone says something stupid
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.120]   and you know, somebody's in the crowd, you know, recording it or someone's picking that
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.440]   stuff up and it ends up on YouTube and that you can't control -- you know, politicians
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:57.080]   can't control the communication much anymore.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.920]   They're really losing a lot of that type of role.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.360]   Well, that's absolutely true.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   I mean --
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.000]   Yeah, it's time to stay out of the public eye.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Well, I think that's getting --
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.200]   Or just do what I do.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   Just stay home.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.960]   I think Alec Baldwin might agree with you.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   Oh my gosh.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   That was what a bonehead move that was.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.840]   So what -- you probably blog this on Devorect.org/blog.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   What happened?
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.240]   With the Alec Baldwin thing?
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.800]   You know, as it -- on foils, it appears as that app to do this.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.360]   I mean, and a lot of people believe his wife, his ex-wife, the -- you know, the actress
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.280]   Kim Basinger had -- I guess -- I don't know.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.680]   They must have had some issues to say believe.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   And I want to leave a message for you right now because, again, it's 10.30 here in New York
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   on a Wednesday.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.760]   And once again, I made an ass of myself.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   He's your old daughter.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   He's your old daughter.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.760]   He's your old daughter.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.920]   When the time comes for me to make the phone call, I stop whenever I'm doing.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.400]   And I go when I make that phone.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   No, he's not happy.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.400]   But you know, I don't want to --
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.120]   How does he make -- by the way, how is he making an ass out of himself by getting, you know,
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   an answer machine?
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.680]   I mean, he's obviously at his wit's end.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.840]   It's possible that he's nutty.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.360]   And maybe his wife's trying to protect the girl or she's nutty.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.520]   And she decided to make it a lot miserable.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   You don't know.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.520]   We'll never know.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.600]   And it's probably something we -- you know, she's been doing well on.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   But you know, it's entertaining.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:22.480]   And we kept to say that these people are public icons and they're subject to scrutiny.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.880]   Well, but the reason I brought it up is more to the point.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.560]   We're all subject to scrutiny nowadays.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   We did every turn.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.520]   Yeah, but if you blow up, it's like you said that same exact thing and blew up at your
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   little girl.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.320]   No, but he's going to care.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.440]   No, he's like, "Oh, Leo, we always knew he's kind of nutty."
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.680]   I mean, it's not going to happen.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   Nobody ever heard of me.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   That's why.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.680]   If I were famous --
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   Well, a lot of people had heard of you.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.960]   You know, you're not like a big political.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   You're not out there.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.480]   Well, and ironically, the number one viral video this week with seven million views in
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:58.680]   like two days is Will Ferrell's two-year-year-old daughter swearing at him.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.680]   Have you seen that?
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   That's awesome.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.640]   Yeah, but that whole thing was -- that's -- it was scripted and it's very funny.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   I've seen it.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.920]   Do you think now there was some criticism of Will and --
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.480]   So it says here, I'm done.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.000]   I'll play a little bit of it.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   This is Will Ferrell.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.400]   Did you get that letter from the doctor yet?
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   I did.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   Adam McKay.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.400]   I knew it.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   Those blood tests don't lie.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.400]   Obviously.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   That is a bad -- and Lord.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.840]   Yeah, and the little girl's playing the whole thing.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   Yeah, it's fabulous.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.840]   Get out of here.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.680]   I'll play a little bit more of it.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   You can hear it.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.600]   The question is, is the girl really swearing or are they just -- because it's in subtitles.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.680]   Here she is at the door of the little two-year-old.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   Hi, Pearl.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   Where's the red?
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   Where's the red?
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   Don't have to raise your voice.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.680]   You pay now.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.680]   You pay now.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.680]   I can give you half.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   You pay now.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   I don't know.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.680]   Was she really saying you pay now, bitch?
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.080]   You know, who cares whether she did or not?
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.420]   I mean, it's obviously the whole thing was a game and it was funny and the girl was
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.520]   in damage for God's sake.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.560]   And it was an amusing scene.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.000]   I thought, you know, people take -- you know, they don't know whether, you know, people
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.680]   are just taking stuff too seriously.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   But boy, 7 million.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.760]   I mean, I can't think of any video that's done that many views that fast.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.760]   It was everywhere.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.160]   Yeah, I don't think guys pretty -- you know, I've never been a big Will Ferrell fan personally,
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.960]   but I think he's obviously got a lot of -- so, you know, he's really -- knows how to do
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   stuff.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   It's amazing.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   He's not now.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.440]   He's making more money than anyone.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.360]   Well, does he make any money on this?
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.840]   No, but it's just more PR for him to get more money for his next movie.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.920]   The guy makes like $10 million a movie.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.280]   He doesn't really need to make any money, does he, on the viral video.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.240]   It's all just one big ad for what he's up to now.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.680]   You're absolutely right.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   It was funny.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   I have to say, I enjoyed it.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   It was funny.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.280]   I got a kick out of it.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:58.320]   Any other big stories, Will, I know -- Walmart's got a $299 HD DVD player coming out.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   That's good news.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.400]   Not Blu-ray, just HD DVD.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.400]   Produced by --
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.400]   Yes.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.200]   -- China's Great Wall Corporation.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.840]   Wow, that sounds above the board.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.840]   It's got to be slave labor.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.600]   Great Wall's been around for a long time.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.040]   They're around in the, I think even far back as the '80s.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.920]   But that stuff got pretty junky.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:22.560]   But, I mean, it's pretty interesting that they're putting the might of Walmart behind
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.760]   HD DVD and not Blu-ray.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.080]   Terabyte hard drives.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:34.160]   One terabyte hard drives coming out from Hitachi.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160]   That's in the area of '51.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.600]   I mean, I'm going to talk about this a long time ago.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.440]   Yeah, we got -- you know, I have two terabytes on one system now.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   Aren't you lucky?
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   Yeah, I was a two terabyte.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.600]   It's a two terabyte club.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.160]   You just back stuff up four times.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.360]   It's fantastic.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:51.440]   There's room for more crap than ever before.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:57.160]   Google drops the word frugal and starts calling its shopping engine the Google product
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   search.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   Why?
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   Why?
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   Oh, that's -- oh, they're off.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.160]   Oh, no.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   Oh.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.160]   It's the -- oh, it's the -- oh, it's the -- oh, it's the -- oh, it's the -- oh, it's
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   the brand everything of as horrible.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.160]   I mean, yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.160]   Frugal is great.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.160]   Frugal is a great name.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   I mean, it's the same product, same services.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.160]   Hi.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.520]   Yeah, I agree with the doc there.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.880]   This is like an example of that -- Microsoft -- Microsoft had to have everything and they
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.600]   wouldn't let you the same word.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   It had to be Microsoft.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   Right.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   It had to be Microsoft-ish.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   Microsoft-ish.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.600]   Microsoft-ish, though.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.600]   And though we forget.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   Microsoft -- oh, yeah.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.920]   Thanks for reminding me of Microsoft.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.240]   I never heard of them before.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.160]   Microsoft will just announce something that some will find fascinating.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.040]   My wife might file papers.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.600]   It's Web History.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:43.480]   Everything you've ever searched for on Google going back quite some time.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.960]   Now, you have to sign up for it, but the point is they've been keeping this information
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.920]   if you have a Google account.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.440]   It's -- well, it's sign up or not.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   They've had it.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.440]   They've had it.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   Right.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.440]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.440]   I mean, you go to a day.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.440]   Well, I'm --
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:00.080]   I mean, how do they know it's you if you're going from computer to computer to change
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.080]   your IP address?
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.000]   Well, because I always -- I have a Google account.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.040]   And I use my -- I log on to my Google account for my various computers.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.320]   And I don't because I -- what ends up is you get these search results where if you try
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:19.200]   to copy the address, you get this long string you want to go.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.880]   Of stuff that you've been to before.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.880]   Right.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.640]   And also, the other thing, Doc, is when you're logged in, you don't get the same search
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.680]   results as somebody else if you're on the phone with them saying, "Yeah, now, type this
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.280]   in and you'll run down."
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   And I said, "No, it's not.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   It's not even on my list."
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.280]   But you find out --
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.440]   You guys don't know that on December 31, 2005 at 1.21 p.m.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.760]   I searched for next cube.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.760]   See?
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.760]   About yourself.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   No, but the big question is why.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   Right.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   You know, you're looking for it.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   It doesn't save intention.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.120]   I would say last cube.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:56.280]   I had 730 Google searches.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.360]   It's preserved.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.000]   It shows you it goes back to August 2005.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.560]   Leo has searched 10,000 times for the word "cube."
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.560]   Cube.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   Cube every time.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   I bought a cube.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.760]   I'm just trying to find somebody who'll buy it from me.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:13.720]   Leo, how many times can it tell you how many times you've Googled Leo report?
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.560]   I'll plead the fifth amendment on this.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.920]   I searched for Shanghai psychotherapist on August 30, 2005.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.000]   Well, are you going to Shanghai?
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   I don't know.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   I have no idea.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.760]   Maybe somebody else is using your machine.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   Maybe you better think about that.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.160]   I think speaking of the fifth, though, I think the big question is...
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.360]   What is it that your wife does, Leo?
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.040]   No, it's just my...
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.680]   Well, I don't know.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.680]   That's a good question.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.440]   No, I think it's just my searches.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   It's fun to actually...
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.920]   You're a machine after when you're logged in.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.040]   They go to your machine and they do a quick search on Facebook.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.760]   And occasionally I see a search for golf course boobs.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.920]   And I know that that wasn't me.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.560]   That's my son, my 12-year-old.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.560]   So that's fun.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.560]   I say, "Ah, Henry."
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.680]   The sun likes boobs on a golf course?
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   Well, I asked him about it.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.200]   He said, "No, he's not an idiot.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.840]   It's not the other kind of boobs."
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.840]   No, it was a funny...
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.160]   I was thinking that would be a little sad.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.400]   He had a very good explanation.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.400]   Sure.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.160]   He said, "There's a video of a guy hitting a golf ball and it hits some woman in the
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.240]   boobs to see.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.240]   It wasn't naked.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.440]   It just starts with that, Leo."
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.440]   You're right.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.440]   You're right.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.440]   And you know that.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.440]   Yeah, I am right.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.440]   It's called a gateway search.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.440]   Gateway search.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.440]   Gateway search.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.440]   You're right.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.440]   This is fascinating.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:29.640]   I can see everything I've searched for for the last, you know, since August 2005.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.680]   And the number of searches per day.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:39.200]   You know, I know that on April 29th, 2006, I made two page visits to Google.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:44.440]   But on April or other March 26th, I made 147 page visits to Google.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.400]   So they're building a robot replica of you.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.600]   Basically, that's right.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.960]   With this information, I think people could paste together everything they need to know
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.960]   about me.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.400]   Anyway, you can turn this on yourself.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.000]   If you have a Google account, it's a new feature.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.920]   And it's actually more accurate that you can see it yourself.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.320]   It's on all the time.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.880]   Well, it also does trends.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.880]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.720]   Oh, I'm embarrassed.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.440]   It does trends.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.880]   Top queries, Leo Laport.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.880]   Number two queries.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.680]   So you're just vanity searching constantly.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.280]   Apparently, that's the most for that.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.600]   Number two search YouTube.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:25.120]   My top sites, wikipedia.org and microsoft.com, followed by Apple and Amazon and PCMag.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.880]   So you're telling me, you know, the funny thing is you do what I do.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.720]   Instead of typing YouTube.com, you type in YouTube to Google.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   And the video saves you the dots.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.720]   And then you just click.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.720]   Well, you don't have to do that.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.720]   Right.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.720]   No, absolutely.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.720]   But I'm not alone.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   We all do that, don't we?
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.720]   I mean, who types in .com anymore?
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   We just type the Google search and click the first thing.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.720]   Right.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.720]   It's pathetic.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.160]   I actually do monthly search activity trends daily search.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:55.240]   I search most on Sundays and least on Thursdays.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.240]   Hourly search activity.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.000]   My big, my big hour is one in the after.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.600]   This is fascinating.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.240]   This is better than a vanity search.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.480]   Yeah, this is genius podcasting.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   And yeah, it's fascinating.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.040]   I'm sure the people out there are just, just riveted by this.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.040]   All right.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.040]   Tell us more about what you're doing.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.040]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.040]   Do it yourself.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.760]   You can see your own search history.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.360]   Let's tell you something.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.680]   Oh, oh, and there's a link here.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.280]   Get interesting items just for you.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   Stuff they recommend based on.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   Ah-ha.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:27.800]   Well, I just discovered that I searched very little in January and February.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   Yes.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   So you do.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   It's really weird.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.440]   My monthly search activity kind of follows this.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.200]   I wasn't logged on.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.200]   I probably wasn't logged on.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:41.800]   I've got, I actually don't search that much on with my, with that on actually having
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.960]   it off most of the time.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.600]   For some reason they're recommending the interesting item they recommended for me is
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.760]   a little color puzzle game.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   I don't know.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.200]   Oh, this is awesome.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.360]   Somebody just had an end just.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.360]   That's psychiatric help.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.760]   Someone just come up with a suggestion in the chat room, which is I'd be more impressed
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.480]   if Google could tell me the search that I wanted to do.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.480]   Ah, but forgot what I was going to do by the time I sat down.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   That would be useful actually.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.440]   Perhaps you were looking for this.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.440]   My glasses.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   Where did you find them?
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.440]   Little.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   Yeah, little more for your lost intentions.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.440]   I'm going to wrap this up.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.560]   I want to thank you all for being here.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.680]   Before we go though, I do want to mention some Alex and I want to mention a good friend
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.240]   of ours who's passed away.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.400]   Alex, do you want to talk about Carl?
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.840]   So first that did the design for the Twit open for the video.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.360]   On the video, yeah.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.680]   And as well as all the Mac break opens and most of the graphics that we've done and a
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.840]   lot of the on-air graphics that we've done for the Pixel core was a member named Carl
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:46.640]   Hossenfrost and Carl was 44 and the art director for WABC in New York.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.240]   Yeah, in fact, I met him every time I do Regis and Kelly go down into the basement at
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.240]   WABC and say hi.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.040]   And he was just a jovial, wonderful guy.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.760]   Yeah, I had dinner every time I went to New York with Carl and really good guy.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.920]   What happened was just a massive heart attack.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.680]   Yeah, just a little heart attack on Friday.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.720]   And we're just, I just found out just before the show and he, he was just an amazing guy
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:13.480]   and just incredibly talented and I think was really getting ready just to do his artwork
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.600]   and it's really sad.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:22.560]   There's, anyway, so it's really lost without him.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.320]   There is a donations can be made to the Hossenfrost children's college fund.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.320]   He has three kids.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:32.680]   He's left behind Mark 11, Kevin 9 and Carter Kate, so who's five?
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.000]   We'll put that information in the show notes.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.400]   Anyway, he was a great guy and we're very sorry to hear about his passing.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:45.800]   You can find Alex Lindsey and the Pixel Core at pixelcore.com and Alex is doing a special
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.760]   deal for the summer for people who like to participate in the Pixel Core.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.000]   It's a great, it's a really neat organization.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.200]   Yeah, where the Pixel Core is going to be doing a drive, we're doing, we have a lot of
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.320]   new applications and a lot of training and a lot of just cool projects to work on over
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.320]   the summer.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.960]   And so we're going to be allowing people to join the Pixel Core.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.720]   This week we're going to open it up so you have to, it won't be quite ready on when this
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:12.520]   show comes out, but later in the week it's for $50 for the whole summer, which is normally,
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.520]   it's normally $50 a month.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:21.600]   And you get access to about $50,000 worth of software, about $100 a training and just
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:27.000]   tons and tons of interesting things to play with and a large group all over the world
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   to play with.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.080]   So it's pretty, you know, it's everything from, you know, podcasting and how to do video and
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.560]   audio and so on and so forth.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:41.560]   But also it's all the way up to, you know, high end visual effects and we really mean
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.560]   high end visual effects.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.360]   So you get to learn all of it, you get to play with it all even if you're going to be
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:50.600]   a hobbyist for, you know, for the summer for $50 you can enjoy it.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:55.280]   If you get in early, you actually get May for free because it really starts in June,
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.800]   June through August, but anybody who signs up just gets in as soon as they sign up.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:05.400]   So we'll be changing that up on Tuesday and so you'll be able to check it out then.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.680]   That's pixacore.com and pixacore.tv for all the podcasts and I'm sure Twim will deal
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.360]   a lot with NAB if you want more.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.360]   In fact, you already have.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.360]   You did a couple of shows from NAB.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.800]   We actually, I think we have this week, we have four Mac breaks, three, three gear media
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.000]   texts and two, Twims all dedicated NAB.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.400]   So if you really want to see all that stuff, go to pixacore.tv and check it out.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.400]   Great.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.600]   Find viral videos and more.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.040]   John C. Devorex blog is a great place to start.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.760]   Devorex.org/blog and CrankyGeek.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.760]   Time doing CrankyGeek.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.760]   That was so much fun.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:43.760]   Yeah, you were great on CrankyGeek.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.680]   You were one of the best guests we've ever had and people really liked seeing you.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:47.680]   I'll come back.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.680]   I'd love to do it again.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.680]   It was really fun.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.760]   I wasn't inviting you back but I'd say I thought you did a great job.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.280]   I'm just kidding.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:59.440]   So, by the way, we do have some stuff on the Web 2.0 conferences on the blog if you look
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.440]   it up.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.640]   I'm just going to do that and it was just parties.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   Anything.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   Did you see anything really cool?
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.760]   There's a lot of cool stuff but it was mostly parties.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.560]   It was like somebody said that what makes a good event like this is two parties for every
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.080]   attendee.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.200]   That sounds good to me.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.320]   We want to thank and let go to bed right now.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.000]   Will Harris, he isn't as jammy's already.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.040]   You've been watching him on video on ustream.tv.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.880]   He does win the geek prize for getting that stream up faster than anybody else.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.080]   Yeah, that was good stuff.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.080]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:36.960]   I think I was consistently more popular than you throughout the entire show.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.960]   Put your shirt back on.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.960]   Oh, there it is.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.960]   I knew there was something.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.440]   Because, yeah, you got like twice as many viewers as I do.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.840]   I don't understand it.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.840]   All right.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.840]   Hey, thanks.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.840]   Will, I really appreciate it.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.840]   Pleasure.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   And thanks to Doc Serals, it's always great to have you on.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.080]   Do you have anything you want to plug?
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.480]   I mean, we already plugged the...
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.200]   Actually, just look up Doc on Google.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.880]   I think I beat the Department of Commerce this month.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.880]   Are you really?
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.880]   Are you number one?
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.880]   I have a look.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:04.880]   I have a book.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.880]   I have a book.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.880]   I have a book.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.880]   Two on Google.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.880]   Right after the Department of Commerce.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.880]   You are the Doc.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.880]   You're the only musician.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.880]   He's the hero.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.880]   He only hooves.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:14.880]   He only hooves.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.880]   And you're the only...
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.880]   Dense-lingers.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   The only human in the front page of the Google search for Doc.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.880]   Let's put it back.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:19.880]   Keeping...
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.880]   Doing it for my species is what I am.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.880]   Keeping real for the species.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.880]   I love it.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.360]   Representing all the Sapiens out there.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.800]   Mr. Doc Serals.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   Great to talk to you.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   Thanks, guys.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.800]   Well, thank you everybody for stopping by Twit.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.200]   This was episode 95.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.920]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.600]   We'll be back next week with another episode.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   Don't forget the website.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.960]   We've got great Twit paraphernalia, including the Twit hat, which we're modeling right now
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.720]   on Ustream.tv, the fabulous Twit hoodies.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.080]   And I just got the new Twit polo shirts from Scottie Best.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.080]   They're really...
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.080]   I'll get you one of these.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   They're gorgeous.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.920]   That's all at twit.tv.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.480]   Oh, one more reminder.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.480]   I want to mention, if you signed up...
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.160]   This is our second anniversary, by the way, guys, of Twit.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.160]   A couple of weeks ago was Twit number one, two years ago.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.160]   And a lot of people...
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.920]   Right around now, we put up the donation buttons, including the one-year donation buttons.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.160]   And last year, I got a lot of heated email from people saying, "How can you pal account?"
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:24.040]   Well, if you signed up for the recurring yearly donation, it's going to happen again next
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.040]   month.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:30.120]   So, I put instructions on the front page of Twit.tv on how to turn that off.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.720]   I don't want to take your money if you don't want to donate it.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:37.880]   But if you signed up for a yearly recurring donation every year, it recurs.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:41.000]   So we'll take another 20 bucks out of your account unless you turn it off.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   Please do turn it off.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.680]   I took it off the front page for that reason because it was obviously confusing people.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.560]   Just a word of warning.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.840]   If you signed up in May or June to support Twit, we do appreciate it.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.600]   And if you sign up for the recurring donation, it will be taken off if you don't want to
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.960]   twit.tv for information.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.360]   And if you want to donate, you can do that too.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.440]   I won't turn down your money.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.440]   Thank you everybody.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.280]   Another Twit is in the can.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:30.800]   This is my favorite joke.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.240]   If a man is alone in the woods and there's not a woman from Myles in any direction, is
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.080]   he still wrong?
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:43.160]   Because the answer is yes.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:47.160]   Yes.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:59:01.100]   All right, do the tweet, baby.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:09.240]   Doo on the tweet, baby.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:13.640]   Doo on the tweet, baby.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:23.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
