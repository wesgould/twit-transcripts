[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.760]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech the Show where you cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.560]   And of course, this was a big week for E3, so we thought we'd bring some people who know
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.320]   something about games in here.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.400]   Cherylin Lowe reviews editor for a catch at No Teasing. Hi, Cherylin.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.240]   Hi, how are you?
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.680]   Good to see you. Actually, you're back from Computex. I want to ask you about all about
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.000]   Computex, but it's great to have you on once again. Do you play games at all?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.080]   I play overcooked. I don't know. I mean, I'm sure Jeff and Shane have heard about it, but
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.760]   is that one of those games where you're like, you're a chef and the people come in and you have
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.560]   to make hamburgers? Yeah, but it's not as simple as that. Overcooked is a little bit more challenging.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.880]   And it's more like a multiplayer game, but I play a few other games to like League of Legends,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.800]   but I wouldn't consider myself like the most hardcore gamer. Do you play overcooked on the
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   Xbox? Is that what you play? You can play. I play on Steam, but the first time I played it,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.560]   and someone I play with my friends is on PlayStation. Now I have another game to play.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.480]   There you go. Overcooked is a lot of fun. I just recently gave up Pokemon Go, so I'm waiting for
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.080]   Harry Potter Wizard's Unite to come out. That's going to be my game. Marvel's is going to be mine.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:27.120]   Oh, OK. Nice. Also joining us, Jeff Kanata, always great to see Jeff at 5x5.tv/dlc.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.840]   It stands for damn likable content. Thank you. Yes. Our joke is that the DLC stands for something
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.960]   different every week. So that's perfectly, perfectly applicable. That's OK. Yeah. That's OK. Great to
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.280]   have you, Jeff. Happy Father's Day. I know you're a new father, a busy guy. Yeah. She's in toddlers
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.320]   around. Yeah. But they don't run in and we create a viral video of them. That'd be good.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.400]   And have your wife drag them out by the heels.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.000]   Shane Satterfield is also here. Shane and I work together way back when.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.520]   Yep. It's good to be back among some tech TV brethren.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.040]   Yeah. Shane was a what was your job at extended play?
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.520]   So I worked on extended play as a segment producer and editorial coordinator.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.160]   And then I was there for the transition from that show to X-Play where I did the same job.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.080]   And then I ended up down in Los Angeles and everybody knows the rest of that story.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.360]   Yeah. Yeah. So X-Play was a great gaming show. And it was really, I think, the longest running
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:41.040]   show on tech TV. I think what was all said and done. Yeah. After the transition down to LA
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.800]   and then away. Yeah. Somehow we were like a cockroach. Nice.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.360]   Well, nobody gets in the way Adam Sessler. He's a machine. He's a machine.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.760]   And Morgan Webb, of course. Yeah. So E3, I know Jeff, you must have gone because you're down there,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:09.360]   right? Yes. Yes. I think this is my 16th or 17th E3. This year was weird, a little odd,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.280]   especially for me, I think I spent less time there than I have in any of the previous 16 or 17 years.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.240]   I have a big new project. I'm doing a Dungeons and Dragons show now, which is really a lot of fun.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.960]   Oh, tell me about that. Dungeon Run. Oh my gosh. What's that? What's it called?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   It's called the Dungeon Run. And I don't want to get sidetracked too much, but it's like
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:39.200]   the thing I'm most proud of maybe in my entire career. It is so much fun. We're creating a
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.440]   television quality live play Dungeons and Dragons show. I'm the Dungeon Master,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.600]   which means I make up everything. It is crazy. We have a fully animatronic mind flayer
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.800]   that hosts the show, kind of like the old crypt keeper from the Tales of the Crypt.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.960]   And the production value is insane. It's a lot of old G4 people, actually.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.120]   And you do it in real time so people can watch in real time.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.400]   That's right. And participate. They can actually change the show and affect the show in really cool
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.160]   ways because it's completely real time on caffeine. Yeah, these are there I am.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:29.200]   The show is a total labor of love and we have an amazing cast. And we have these incredible
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.400]   models that we get to make and play Dungeons and Dragons. It's like a dream come true.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.200]   What fun. But I didn't mean to get off on a tangent there. I apologize for that.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.520]   Did your ad curiosity, did your mom say you'll never make a living playing video games?
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.880]   Oh, I think yes. I think everybody's mom did. But it's just having this conversation at E3
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.120]   with somebody where when we were doing the Totally Rad show back in 2007,
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:58.160]   we sold t-shirts that said Nerd is the new cool. And we it was like tongue in cheek back then.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.760]   We didn't think that that was actually true. We just kind of were it was like our mantra.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.080]   And it has actually become true. It is crazy geek culture and nerd dumb and all video games
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.440]   and stuff like that is taking over the mainstream in a way that's almost a little scary to be quite
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.800]   honest for my generation. Oh, yeah. It's as valuable as Hall of Hollywood put together.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.600]   Actually, Shane, one of the reasons E3 was weird this year was there was no Sony.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   Yeah, big deal, no PlayStation at all. And it wasn't just Sony either. Electronic
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.560]   Arts left the show floor a couple years ago. Activision was not on the show floor this year.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.040]   Microsoft used to have a limited presence on the show floor, but most of its operations are now
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.160]   across the street at LA live. So yeah, it was a big deal. I think there's a lot of concern about
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.360]   the future of E3 right now. The former ESA president, Michael Gallagher, he just stepped down and
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.400]   according to my inside sources, the industry in general was not happy with the direction he was
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.600]   taking it. And if the essay is the lobbying faction in Washington for the games industry,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.520]   and they just hired a brand new president. And one of his goals is to try to get people back on
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.240]   board for E3. Although next year you're going to have a launch of or probably the launch of the
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.640]   PlayStation 5 launch of Xbox Scarlett. So chances are good that I think by the time this new ESA
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.080]   president starts working with the publishers and the publishers start to realize, hey, we need to
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.720]   launch these platforms next year. I have a feeling they'll probably be back for E3 2020.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.280]   It did feel empty though. It really was striking.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.760]   Tuesday was really bad. Usually the way E3 goes is Tuesday is the busiest day and then it slowly
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.000]   tapers off by Thursday. This year Tuesday was the worst day. And then Wednesday was okay.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.200]   Thursday was strong in the morning, but by the afternoon it was like a ghost town. So attendance
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.080]   was down about 2000 people this year, which isn't a huge slide, but you're starting to see the
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.800]   trend now we're starting to go down. So something has to be done.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.360]   And Shin, I'm sure you remember many years barely being able to walk through the aisles and
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.280]   being bombarded on all sides by cacophony. And that was before they left the public in.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.080]   Keep in mind that was still just industry. And now they're letting the public into the show and
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.120]   it's smaller than it used to be. There's two halls, two main halls used to be three and now there's
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.880]   two. And even those, I feel like they could have gotten by with one. There's easily 30 to 40 feet
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:32.960]   of perimeter now that's just not used. And it was easy to walk through the walkways.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.400]   And there was a lot less to see in each hall. It really felt markedly different to me this year.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.440]   The ESA is incentivized to fix it because it generates over 80% of its annual revenue from E3
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.600]   alone. And that's part of the rub is that the ESA relies on that money to operate all year long.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.560]   And so it ends up gouging the publishers for floor space. Like I've heard that just for the
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.560]   floor space for a medium sized booth there, it's like $5 million for the three days.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.040]   But the problem is it's hard for the ESA to lower that entrance fee because that's where all
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.080]   its money comes from. So it's kind of a catch 22, but the bottom on is the ESA is going to have to
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.360]   work with the industry. Like it or not, this is the biggest game show of the year worldwide.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.080]   As far as importance and where people tune in to see things, it also has the farthest reach as far
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:27.040]   as more commercial outlets because stuff happens in gaming every day of the year. But it's only E3
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.840]   where you get the USA Today's and the Yahoo's and everything reporting on it. So something has
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   to be done to save it. And I just hope that the publishers are willing to work with the ESA to
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.880]   try to find a better alternative going forward. I mean, I think the publishers are finding that
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:47.760]   they don't need a show that they can disintermediate their message. They can do things like what Nintendo
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.160]   has been doing with Nintendo Direct. Now, Sony is doing the same thing where they're just
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.720]   instead of standing on a stage in front of a bunch of media, they just package things together,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.400]   put it out on YouTube or on any other streaming site. And anytime they want, rather than conforming
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:10.240]   to a schedule of when a show is, I think you make a good point about the mainstream media taking
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.840]   note during these time periods. But there certainly doesn't need to be a show floor or the millions
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.040]   of dollars these companies spend to do that. We've already seen companies like Apple and Samsung,
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.000]   not have to rely on things like CES to get their message out. I think that's the trend.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.520]   And where all of these things are going is the companies go, we don't need the media and we don't
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:40.720]   need a show to package everybody together. In fact, we'd prefer to have the spotlight solely on us
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.600]   and make our own event that we can make perfect and not have to do it live in front of an audience
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.320]   anyway. >> Yeah. >> I think if you look at it, though, Sony announced the initial specs for
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.880]   PlayStation 5 about a month before E3 got no mainstream coverage whatsoever. Xbox announces
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.560]   the first specs for Scarlett on its stage at E3. It's on the front page of CNN. So there's a lot
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.160]   of weight behind that. And you talk about particular games. There are some games that don't need mainstream
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.320]   exposure because even if they get it, it's not going to really make a difference. But if you think
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:18.480]   about taking a game that sells 6 million copies into the realm of selling 12 million, you do need
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.720]   that more casual audience to be informed about the game. So it's not a perfect science. But I think
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.440]   it'll be better for the industry overall if it unites and they all come back to E3 and we create
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.840]   that spectacle again that you and I are both familiar with. >> Some conferences are surviving.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.200]   I mean, this is what happened to Comdex, the old PC conference. No one needed to go to that
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.680]   anymore. But CES thrives was Computex pretty busy, Sherlyn, where there are a lot of companies
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.560]   and people there. >> Comptex was certainly more interesting than years past, actually. So I'm
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.280]   surprised that this is kind of going against the trend that you guys have rightly pointed out. I
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:59.200]   mean, you know, just look at last year, what happened was in October, every company did their
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.640]   own thing. And so people who were in the consumer tech industry, like myself and some of my peers,
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.920]   we were just stressed to death in October because we had Google, we had Apple, we had Samsung,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.280]   everyone just announced thing after thing after thing. Then we had the review season,
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.320]   then we had the like, it's just a bit much. I mean, like, yes, the companies will have the
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.640]   luxury of doing everything on their own schedule when they stay away from shows. But for us as a
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.840]   lean team, or if you're someone that's trying to do all of this on your own, it's nearly it will
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:36.400]   drive you to your near grave. As for Comptex, it was really pretty cool to see, actually.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.560]   There was a lot of chip news. I think that chip news dominated Comptex. And chip news is
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.840]   important because that drives a lot of the rest of the news for the rest of the year.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.920]   PC is in PC gaming, in console gaming, even. You talk about ray tracing that NVIDIA pushed out.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.560]   I think it was, you know, I can't remember if it was a Comptex, but one similar show like that,
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.760]   that NVIDIA first showed off something like that. And then ray tracing is now making its way to
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.160]   the product Scarlett. And also, I mean, yes, the PS5, you know, specs didn't get a lot of mainstream
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.560]   media coverage, but we got a lot of coverage in tech, right? So we covered it. Wired, I think,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.600]   you know, had that full interview. All of our other publications in the space also covered it.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.040]   People went wild for it, the PlayStation specs stuff. And so yes, ray tracing is also in the
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:25.920]   PlayStation 5. To you guys' point though, I agree that there's so much more benefit for us
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.000]   as journalists or as, you know, people working in media for everything to be concentrated around
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.120]   a fixed period of time, just because it gives us the opportunity to focus all of our resources
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.480]   on that event during that one period of time. Because otherwise, if it's spread out across
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:48.800]   like the rest of the year, I am torn in a million directions all the time. And not everything is
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.280]   going to get the focus or the attention it deserves. Whereas like a smaller company or like a
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:00.560]   mid-range company, say like a media tech, for example, I don't want to like call out anyone to
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:07.680]   whatever, both in the chip industry. Media tech isn't like an Intel or an ARM or an AMD, right?
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:13.760]   So, but their news gets covered at Computex because we have people, you know, on hand to handle
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.560]   Computex related news. Whereas somewhere else, like in some other part of the year, they might not
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.600]   have gotten the attention perhaps that we, you know, that they could have been afforded.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:29.680]   So I think there's benefits for like the not so big players to still come to the shows and maybe
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.520]   those are the companies that need to rally. Yeah, I think they don't have any money.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:41.440]   That's what you think is expensive. Yeah, you can those with the in the game space, those smaller
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.160]   games can draft behind the larger games and get a lot of that attention. I think you make a great
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.720]   point, Sherlyn. It's it is and Shane was saying this earlier as well. It by having your resources
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   because you're going to draw eyeballs on your coverage of the big splashy games, you also get
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.640]   to cover a whole bunch of games and all of our inboxes are, you know, full of all of these PR
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.760]   companies trying to get you to notice the smaller stuff. And I always make a point to try to,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.960]   you know, surface a lot of that at these at these shows as well because that is a time for those
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.000]   games to get noticed and shine alongside the heavy hitters. It feels like gaming is something
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.520]   unique, sui generis. It's not like any other business we've seen in technology before. And
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:34.480]   it's kind of ironic because Computex is all about what some might even say is a dying industry,
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:40.000]   certainly not a growing industry, the PC industry. And gaming is about a growing industry, but nobody
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.800]   seems to care to go to the trade show. There's one thing for sure though, the gaming fan conferences
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.040]   are bigger than ever and they're more of them than ever and PAX West has already sold out and
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:58.800]   the comic cons are going huge. It seems like for the fans, those shows are very successful.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.640]   Yes. They're getting more access to it.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.240]   Yeah. I mean, it kind of started with Gamescom in Germany, which is the biggest game show in Europe.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.680]   They started letting fans in almost immediately when they started that show. And it's, I mean,
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.800]   as far as size is concerned, it's the biggest game show in the world. It's
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.440]   dwarfs E3 as far as general attendance is concerned.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:23.680]   One of the other problems I have with E3 is it just seems to be mostly game trailers for games
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.480]   that won't be coming out for a year. You bring up a really good point. And this is something that
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:36.160]   changed at E3 2019 is that there aren't many games being played at E3 anymore. And a lot of that
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:44.880]   is the result of fans scrutinizing live gameplay demos and and skewering publishers on social media.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.840]   It's basically intimidating them out of the there's no upside to showing gameplay early. And then
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.080]   they get criticized for not showing any gameplay. It's it's a damned if you do damned if you don't
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.760]   have a situation. But there is nothing more prickly than a gamer that has to be the hardest
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:07.200]   audience to serve gamers. It's tough. It's tough. I mean, it's not so I mean, the industry has grown
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.160]   up and like our site generally we have really hard moderation on our site and that keeps a lot
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.880]   of the kids away. So our site is kind of this oasis of adult gamers people like Jeff and I who have
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.800]   been doing it for a long time and just really love the hobby. But when you start dipping into and
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.680]   look if you're a media person in 2019, you have to be a part of places like YouTube. And if you start
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.240]   dipping your toe in there, you start to interact with a lot of the younger audience. And it is
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.720]   very, very difficult. So it's an age thing. I'm yeah, I don't know. It's completely an age thing.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.320]   There are a lot of middle aged trolls out there. But I don't know. I mean, one thing we do know is
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.360]   that the image people have of gamers as being 14 year old boys is completely wrong. It's a
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.760]   bunch of middle aged guys like you guys. And you know, even yes, that's true. But also,
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.080]   Sherlin, you at the beginning of the show, you she's a gamer. But that's the promise that you
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.560]   are not hard. Right. Yes. I'm not hard. Game is going to be hard for me to call myself
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.240]   anything like a gamer because the crap that I would get for saying that is your problem.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.040]   Crap, especially is a problem. But I get that. Leo, you're not a gamer. Well, I play games.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.400]   What does it mean to be a gamer? The label is unimportant. I hate that label.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.920]   Oh, firstly, I try to never say the word gamer. I hate it because it is this stereotype that I've
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:31.600]   lived my whole life with that I've fought to get rid of. So when I'll be on a three hour podcast,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.840]   I'll never say the word gamer once. I go on podcast. I'm just saying like, it is a negative
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.960]   stereotype. And I feel like as people who are serious about games, it's something we've been
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.360]   trying to shed for a really long time. So I don't want to say I ignore it. But well,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.800]   but I'm not going to see Pokemon go coverage on sifted. Oh, yeah, well, really? Oh, yeah.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.120]   Go page on sifted. There's like 8,000 pieces of content for it.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.040]   So Kat, you do casual gaming as much as a list gaming. Yeah, I mean, if it's big, I mean,
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.480]   Pokemon go is, I mean, it's bigger than almost anything. It's also had crazy legs. Like, I've
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:12.320]   been really shocked to see how long that game has lasted. But yeah, we cover everything on
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.120]   sifted. You have to. I mean, it's people are playing games all the time.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.440]   That's what makes it so hard is there are, I mean, the people who play animal crossing
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.320]   have no interest in call a duty. I don't know about that. I think the people who play call of duty
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.880]   when they're out and about, they pull out their phone and they play games and it wasn't always that
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.800]   way. There was a lot of pushback initially from quote unquote hardcore gamers on mobile gaming.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.520]   But as the games have gotten better, the technology has gotten better. People absolutely core gamers
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.720]   play mobile games and you're starting to see publishers who typically play in the console space,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.000]   making really good mobile games, Nintendo and Bethesda. And I will say that those tend to be
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.320]   the games and from the publishers that hardcore gamers gravitate towards, like they're more likely
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:02.640]   to play a Bethesda mobile game than a mobile game from King say. But the fact is they're playing
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.880]   mobile games, they're contributing to that ecosystem and they're helping generate revenue for mobile
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.880]   gaming. King makes just for just an annotation for people who don't know what the hell we're
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.240]   talking about. King makes candy crush. Okay, right. One of the biggest takeaways for me
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:23.520]   from this E3 is how those lines are going to disappear. Because if you had a, I had to define
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:32.320]   what E3 2019 was about for me, it was this, the beginning of the streaming revolution in games.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.720]   I mean, we've already seen it start. This is really where it's coming into its own with Stadia,
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:43.360]   with what Xbox is doing with Game Pass and how the barrier to entry on being a quote unquote
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.120]   gamer or hardcore gamer or whatever silly label we have to use. That is going to completely
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.840]   disappear and we're going to, you're going to be able to play any game on any device at any time
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.920]   all the time. And you won't have to buy a box to put under your television and you won't have to
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:05.440]   invest $400 to start. It'll be instantaneous on devices you already have with things you already own
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:11.520]   and it will be like just loading candy crush on your phone. But it will be these bigger, more
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.640]   quote unquote hardcore experiences and all of, I think all of those labels will start to just
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.120]   morph into one another and it won't make any difference.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:25.360]   And I think it'll eliminate the tribalism that's in gaming like fanboys. You know, when you don't
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.760]   have a piece of hardware to cheer for and everyone's just playing on this thing that they don't even
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.560]   see and it's just beaming to their cell phone or their tablet or their TV. I think it'll take away
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.160]   a lot of the negative elements that have been a part of the games industry for a long time.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.880]   Well, all I know is the, to me, the big story about E3 was the Keanu Saunts.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.080]   We're in full Keanu Saunts.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.600]   We're in full Keanu Saunts.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.480]   This is my hen house brewing company that's down the street.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.880]   Their new beer Keanu is immortal.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.160]   Keanu is...
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.480]   I think it tastes of taste Keanu.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.280]   It tastes like you got a pencil to the neck is what it tastes like.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.600]   Keanu...
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.400]   Go ahead.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.000]   Leo, I've been to... I've been in the room at E3 for some big names.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.760]   I mean, the surviving Beatles were on the stage.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.840]   Steven Spielberg was on the stage.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.400]   Kobe Bryant was on the stage.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.320]   When he... Big, big names.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:28.560]   I have never seen a response at E3 like Keanu Reeves walking on stage.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.440]   The place I was sitting there, I couldn't believe it.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.760]   Exploded into a standing ovation.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.720]   It was...
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.280]   It was...
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:35.920]   In scene.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.280]   Keanu...
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:37.920]   I didn't understand it.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.680]   Why is he a guy that all the gamers seem to love?
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.360]   Because of John Wick 3, baby.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.680]   I guess it's an overlap of interest.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.960]   It's the exact...
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.120]   It's the exact...
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.360]   It kind of amazes me.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.640]   He's cool.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   He's cool.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.160]   He's cool.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.280]   I guess.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.200]   How do you see that?
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.600]   I still think a Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.760]   In movie.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.600]   I just saw a tweet going around recently of Keanu taking pictures
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.360]   where he's not touching women's backs.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.000]   I saw that.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.640]   Did you see that one?
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.680]   I love that.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.080]   His hand...
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.160]   Not only is he not touching their backs,
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   but he's intentionally sticking his hand out.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.400]   Like if this was Cheryl, like farther,
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.640]   so you can see that he's not touching their backs.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.280]   I don't blame him.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.360]   I feel like that's the new Hollywood way.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.560]   I don't blame him.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.040]   That's pretty cool.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.080]   I don't blame him at all.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:28.640]   Are you kidding?
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.800]   He seems like he's got his...
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.400]   Like he's got a good head on his shoulders.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:32.800]   So...
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.480]   He sees the matrix.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.560]   Anyway, yeah, I saw it and I thought,
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.960]   "Wow, Microsoft, big win.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.400]   This was for a game called Cyberpunk 2077,
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.600]   which don't get all excited.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.680]   It's going to come out in 2077."
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.480]   For a while, we thought that,
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.960]   because it's been in development for like nine years.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.760]   It's Duke Nukem Forever all over again.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.080]   No, actually they say now next spring.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:24:59.680]   May.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.160]   May.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.800]   Finally.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.520]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.400]   It's based on a book that's set in 2020,
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.840]   so the date's kind of perfect.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.520]   I don't know if that was their plan all along,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.480]   but it kind of worked out.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.760]   We knew that all along.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.240]   Yeah, sure.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.640]   Sure.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.440]   That was our plan.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.760]   So there's no question gaming is huge.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.720]   There's also no question.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.880]   It's a very unusual business,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.080]   because I guess it's kind of like Hollywood a little bit.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:30.560]   Hollywood has fans in a bunch of different genres,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.920]   and it serves those fans.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.160]   It's very expensive to make a major motion picture.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.520]   It's very expensive to make a game.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.960]   It's a little longer to make a game.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.800]   Takes more people maybe.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.840]   But is that the closest industry?
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.920]   Is the movie interesting?
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.800]   I think the biggest difference is that a movie
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.720]   can be changed in the editing room,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.880]   and can be changed as you shoot it,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.240]   and obviously the script changes a lot.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.880]   But pretty much once you start marketing a movie,
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.760]   it's very close to being done.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.960]   It is almost...
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.080]   You know what it is.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.880]   It is frustrating to me that the gaming industry promotes this stuff
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.920]   so far ahead of time.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.800]   Well, the people with all the signs are so big.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.040]   You have to ensure that there is an audience for this thing
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.440]   because you're spending so much money on it,
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.760]   as the thing is taking shape.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.000]   And that's the real tough thing to square.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.920]   It is difficult for this industry to figure out ways to promise things
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.240]   when the people making the game aren't sure
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.000]   that they're going to pull off those promises.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.240]   And it's just a fact of game design.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.080]   Well, Duke, can you come forever?
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.120]   Is it a perfect example?
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.640]   I think it's hard to find.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.040]   No wonder...
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.360]   No wonder...
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   ...is concerned gaming is more closely aligned with Gillette than Hollywood.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.520]   Because if you sell the console at a loss,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.800]   or you make no money,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.400]   and then you make all the money off the blades or the games.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.520]   So financially, it's more similar to something like that than Hollywood.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.320]   Well, that's true of the gaming console manufacturers,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.960]   Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, but there's only a handful of those.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.760]   That is different from movies because,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.480]   I mean, you can watch movies in a movie theater,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.520]   but you have to own some expensive gear.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.000]   That's actually one of the things that's most interesting to me about Stadia.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.520]   Let's take a break.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.280]   When we come back, I want to talk about Google's play.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.240]   Last week, Carsten explained it to me.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.520]   I didn't know what...
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.360]   I couldn't figure out who would want this.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.560]   If you're a PC gamer,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.400]   if you've got a PC.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.080]   If you're a console gamer, you've got a console.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.000]   Who is the market for this?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.800]   Carsten explained it, but I'll talk about that just a second.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.840]   First is that we've got a great panel here for not just talking about games.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.160]   There's a lot more we're going to talk about in the show,
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.800]   including the United States deciding that they want to open cyber war with Russia.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.840]   Oh, that'll go well.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.720]   Jeff Kanata is here from... Should I say from the new show, the dungeon run?
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.680]   Dungeon run.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.720]   Dungeon run.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.040]   And DLC on 5x5.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.000]   Do you have to have caffeine to watch Dungeon Run?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.200]   No, it's available on YouTube and also as an audio podcast,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.640]   anywhere you get podcasts.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.880]   If you like listening to people, pretending to wander around in a cave,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   this is a podcast for you.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.920]   I'm telling you, I'm very proud of you.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.120]   You're best dungeon master.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.960]   Give me an example.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.640]   How does it sound when you're like...
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.480]   Well, I think last episode, I did seven different voices of different
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.400]   characters that the team ran into.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.440]   Wow.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.920]   Yeah, I mean, it's high adventure.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.000]   This is Game of Thrones, but improvised every week.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.640]   And I'm telling you,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.800]   listen, I don't like to toot my own horn too much,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.360]   but the show is very good and I'm very proud of it.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.440]   And we're doing something that is really coming from our hearts
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.520]   and putting a lot of blood, sweat and tears into it.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.480]   So I hope people check it out.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.840]   All the best, that's great.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.720]   Thanks.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.040]   Also with us today, Cheryl and Lo,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.480]   she is in charge of all the reviews at Engadget.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.840]   I wonder she's tired.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.640]   Holy cow.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.480]   There's a lot of stuff.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.440]   There's a lot of stuff.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.960]   Way too much stuff.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:11.360]   And Jane Satterfield, he's the founder and man in charge is Sifted Games Sifted.net.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.560]   The first gaming site for people like me,
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.360]   because you pick what you want to see.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.240]   It's curated content and you pick the content you're interested in.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.280]   I think that's a brilliant move.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.040]   Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.000]   I know everybody listening to the show knows what a VPN is.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.040]   A virtual private network has a bunch of benefits.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.800]   It lets you keep your traffic on the internet protected from the guy in the hoodie in the corner
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.280]   at the coffee shop, but also private from your internet service provider, from your carrier.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.600]   It allows you to emerge on the public internet in the country of your choice.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.320]   So you don't have to worry about geographic content restrictions.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.600]   But there's always the question, but what's the best VPN?
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.480]   Let me talk about what I think makes a great VPN.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.320]   And then I'll tell you the best VPN.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.760]   First of all, it's got to be fast, right?
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.680]   Because if you're using a VPN and suddenly the internet is unusable, what's the point?
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.080]   It also has to be secure because remember,
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.560]   if you're using a VPN to bypass privacy, to protect your security,
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.280]   you're putting the burden on the VPN provider.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.240]   They have to be good, not only fast, but they have to protect your privacy.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.840]   They have to delete their logs.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.880]   They can't know anything about what you're doing and no, you know, voluntarily delete
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.120]   everything that they could know about what you're doing.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.240]   That's really important.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.440]   They have to be secure.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.960]   We know that there are VPNs that leak your information, not intentionally, but because they're poorly
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.920]   created.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.600]   This is why I use ExpressVPN.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.080]   Number one VPN, according to tech radar, it's number one with me too.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.560]   Your privacy is absolutely safe at ExpressVPN.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.120]   It's absolutely secure and it's super fast.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.240]   They have servers everywhere.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.320]   That means you're close to a server, but it also means you can emerge onto the internet
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   in the country of your choice.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.480]   This is a VPN, the kind of VPN you want, and they have apps for every platform.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.640]   One button, one click to turn it on, one click to turn it off.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.760]   So it couldn't be more convenient, more easy to use.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.280]   ExpressVPN, protect your privacy, protect your security.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.440]   Use a VPN service that cares about you.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.680]   Less than $7 a month and it's the VPN protection I use.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.800]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.320]   Actually, we have the best deal for you.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.080]   When you buy a one-year package at expressvpn.com/twit,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:32.000]   you'll get three extra months free, three extra months free, but you have to go to expressvpn.com/twit.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.600]   ExpressVPN.com/twit, I thank ExpressVPN for creating a really excellent VPN and protecting
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.320]   our privacy and for supporting this week in tech.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.080]   Information about Stadia came out this week.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.800]   Again, a perfect example, completely independent of E3.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.320]   They announced at GDC the game developers conference, which made sense.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.720]   They need developers, but they didn't wait till E3 to announce
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.240]   the platform.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.240]   So here's the theory.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.960]   This is Karsten's theory, not mine.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.520]   I don't get it.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.240]   What was the founder's edition?
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.560]   120 bucks, you get a Chromecast Ultra.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:18.880]   130, you get a Chromecast Ultra, a dedicated Stadia Wi-Fi based,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.800]   kind of goofy controller.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.040]   It's okay, but it's just odd.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.640]   And you get three months and a buddy pass for a friend for three months,
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.280]   and you get the destiny two.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:37.120]   And then, and this is the thing that puzzled me, it's not like Microsoft's
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:37.840]   game pass.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.560]   It's not like Sony's streaming gaming service.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.800]   You pay for the game.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.760]   You have to buy the game.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.160]   There's no...
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:55.120]   Well, their messaging at the event was perplexing to me, because the thing about Stadia is you
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.040]   don't have to buy anything.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:57.680]   Oh.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.000]   You don't need the $130 founders back.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.680]   You don't need the $999 monthly fee.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.360]   They have a free stuff for T.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.160]   None of that is required to use Stadia.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:14.240]   In fact, you probably already have everything you need to just buy a game and play it.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.000]   If you want to play it in 4K at 60 frames per second,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   yeah, you need that $999 fee.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.680]   And if you want to stream it on your television,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.960]   you're going to need a Chromecast, so they're going to sell you that.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.920]   And if you want to use their controller, you got to buy their controller.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.280]   But it supports all the controllers you probably already own.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:37.200]   And if you have anything that can load Chrome onto it, you can probably already do it.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   So what they should have said, how they should have led to that event, in my opinion, is,
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:49.840]   "Hey, this is a way for anybody to play AAA games right now with the stuff you already own.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.800]   All you got to do is buy the game and you can play it."
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.880]   But if you want to play it in all these other ways,
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.400]   if you want a rotating selections of games that will be free,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.800]   if you want to do it at 4K, we offer these other options that will sell you as part of this
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.200]   Founder's Pack, as part of a monthly subscription, that does sort of compete with
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.600]   Game Pass on a certain level, although the details remain to be revealed.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:21.120]   But all those things are additive to what the core selling point, in my opinion, of what Stadia is,
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:28.880]   which is no barrier of entry, no need for a console, you can just play it in Chrome on the stuff you
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.840]   already have. And that's where I think they fumbled the ball because, like you, most people
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.680]   didn't come away understanding that.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:43.040]   Does it play well? Because the other problem is completely out of Google's hands, which is
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.760]   that you have to push it down whatever internet pipe you have.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.480]   Yeah, that's the most sticking point.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.160]   Yeah, you play it, Shane.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:56.800]   Yeah, I also played XCloud at Microsoft's installation at E3.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.880]   And both technologies to me work far better than I ever dreamed that they would.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.080]   Now, because it's not new, we've seen this before, we saw OnLive,
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:10.400]   Gai-Kai. Yeah. And I think we've just matured into it working at this point.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.080]   They were just a little too early.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.600]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.800]   I think the server farms, I mean, you have Google, obviously, they have nodes all around the world,
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.440]   and obviously they can put their traffic on whatever lane they want to.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.160]   So they're kind of in the ideal position to do this.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.640]   But in Microsoft, the same deal with XCloud.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.520]   Obviously, it has its own infrastructure that it can use for that.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.120]   And I used XCloud at E3, and I was blown away by how good it was.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.880]   I mean, they had a controller and they had a little attachment on the controller with a mobile phone.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.720]   And we were playing Gears of War, and it's really hard to explain, seeing that level of
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.200]   graphical fidelity on a little screen like that, how impressive it is, until you actually have it
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.680]   in your hands. Yeah, because all of the work is being done server-side. So they might be using
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.080]   the effectively of a powerful gaming PC, even though you're looking at a screen on a phone.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.640]   Yep. And they're just beaming that video signal to you. And the latency is so much
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.680]   better than it was for OnLive and Gai-Kai. What I play a game-
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.040]   But you can't wait a minute, Shane.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.840]   Or a competitive shooter on it? Probably not.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.400]   You can't judge-
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.200]   You can't judge-
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.920]   Shane, you can't judge latency at a demo like that. That's a private network you're on.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.720]   No, you're right.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.000]   Yeah, they can-
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.520]   Try it at home. Tell me how it works when you're on Comcast, or Frontier.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.680]   What the hell is going to look like then?
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.440]   Or the future of this is what 5G, right? And everything comes back to 5G for me.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.760]   Thank God 5G is just around the corner.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:41.680]   I didn't know my phone was going to end. It said 5G right on it.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.560]   Yeah, yeah. 5G. You know it's a little easier.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.160]   Yeah, I mean, it's easier.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.760]   Yeah, that's what Sadie is supposed to do, right? It's supposed to make it so you can play on your
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.200]   phone. X cloud, it's supposed to play on your phone. What are you going to play it on?
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.480]   Because all the problems are being done there, and you're just waiting for them to transfer.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.640]   I'm waiting for Elon Musk's Starlink. That's going to be the future of gaming.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:07.040]   The emails that I always get are I have data caps in my area.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:07.600]   Right.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.080]   I have slow internet speeds. I live in midwest.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.640]   What kind of bandwidth do these things use? Is it a lot?
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.520]   A lot.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.600]   In fact, there's a bunch more than Netflix, more than watching a 4K movie.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.640]   Much more.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.080]   And there's a lot of articles about how they're unfriendly to the environment too,
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.720]   which is surprising.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.200]   Oh, yeah. These servers are chunking along.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.440]   I mean, it's worse than your gaming console in terms of power usage.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.880]   Oh, yeah, for sure.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.560]   But I don't know if you've tried PlayStation Now, which we used to be called Gai-Kai,
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.960]   or if you ever tried on live, and those services, PlayStation Now is like usable.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.760]   It's not perfect yet, but it is usable.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.960]   I've used the GeForce Now, NVIDIA streaming solution on my NVIDIA Shell.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.800]   And they're all kind of there.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.440]   So the assumption is once you get on the backbone of a Google or a Microsoft,
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.280]   that experience should improve drastically.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.040]   So it is a bit of an assumption, and I understand you're absolutely right.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:05.360]   They can jimmy these demos a little bit, but I also feel like it's like we were saying earlier,
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   gamers are pretty crafty, and they can sniff out a scam,
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.520]   probably better than anyone else on the internet.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.520]   If you do that, you're playing with fire.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.640]   I mean, the backlash for that could literally crush your business.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.760]   But also, right, it's not an if, it's a when.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:25.040]   This isn't like, oh, will they ever be able to do it?
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.760]   It's just, are we still too early, like on live was, or are we arriving now?
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.200]   Is it your sense, though?
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.400]   This is my problem.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.560]   Gamers have a gaming system.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:40.400]   They're on Steam or their PC or they're using Game Pass on their Xbox.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:47.840]   You don't think the idea of not having to buy another $500 box every four years is attractive to
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:53.280]   people. I mean, I think there's a huge number of people that if you reduce the barrier to entry,
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.200]   will now be able to have access to the game.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.440]   So this is for the next billion gamers.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:58.880]   Yes.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.320]   Literally, this is people like me who would play a game.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.600]   I've been thinking about buying a console or a Switch just to play over course.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:13.280]   But there are people who won't shell out for a console or are thinking about buying
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.600]   so-called a gaming phone to play a mobile game.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.200]   But I think these efforts make it easier for people like me to get into gaming.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.480]   And then it might be incentivized to invest more and say a better controller or maybe a VR
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.840]   headset for when the VR version of my favorite game comes out.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.320]   I think the big fear is that it's Google and Google has a history of coming up with an idea
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.160]   and launching it. And then if it doesn't go as well as it hoped in the first year or so,
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.800]   bailing on it.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.000]   Short attention span.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.520]   It just doesn't seem to-
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   It just doesn't seem to-
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.280]   Everyone's going to be there. I think everybody is going to be doing this.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.000]   I think everybody wants to be the Netflix for video games.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.560]   And I think it's just a matter of time. I mean, I think you could probably find some
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.320]   episodes of Twit back in the old days where people were saying,
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.920]   "Well, I still like my Blu-rays. The quality is going to be-
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.480]   I don't want Netflix. I want my Blu-rays."
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:15.760]   And I think it's just inevitable that this convenience and lack of barrier to the entry will
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:22.080]   trump all the other things at a certain point. And my kids are going to think it was weird that
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.520]   I ever had a black box sitting under my television to play video games on.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.160]   Even if you can get an Xbox for a couple hundred bucks.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.280]   I think it's not just that you can get an Xbox for a couple hundred bucks,
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.720]   but it's the stuff that you already have. I played Assassin's Creed Odyssey on my
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:45.440]   Chromebook, my crappy little Chromebook that I have for work because I just need something to
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:55.040]   use the email on. And I played it using Stadia, a AAA incredible content rich graphic intensive
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.680]   game on my Chromebook. And it was very playable.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.960]   And it's really it's really gaming everywhere. The idea is that let's have AAA gaming on every
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.400]   device everywhere all the time. Yes. I think it's going to take a while though before streaming
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:13.040]   takes over. I agree with everything Jeff said. He's right. It's inevitable. It's going to happen.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.960]   Is it going to happen the next three or four years? I don't know. There's a lot of gamers,
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:23.360]   most people would call core gamers who have already rejected streaming and Stadia because
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.320]   it's in a lot of cases just because it's not a Nintendo console or it's not a PlayStation console.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:33.280]   And then, and again, Jeff was also right that the messaging coming out was not great because a lot
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   of people looked at that announcement and did the math and was like, wait a minute. So I could pay
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:43.840]   for my PlayStation 5 or my Xbox 2 or whatever they end up calling it and have something. And
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.920]   that would, within two years of playing for Stadia, I could actually own the console instead of owning
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.480]   nothing. So console players are stubborn. It's hard to get them to move in a direction and get the
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.720]   whole her going. But I think more casual players are probably going to be, they're going to be enough
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.680]   of them to keep it afloat hopefully until the more hardcore players start migrating over.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:11.840]   And I'm in that category too. I want everything computed locally. I want the Ferrari of gaming
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:17.280]   consoles sitting in my house generating massive amounts of heat but pumping out the pixels. That's
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.560]   what I sign up for. I'm not excited about the streaming future in the sense that I think it's
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:28.080]   going to be a better experience for me. I just think exactly what you said, Leo, about the next
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:35.040]   billion gamers is what this represents. It is completely eliminating the barrier of entry and it
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:41.920]   opens up the hobby to people that probably wouldn't shell out the money for consoles. And it makes
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.640]   it ubiquitous, it divorces it from any specific device and now you can play it on anything
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:54.480]   anywhere all the time. It's certainly going to put a lot of pressure, at least in the US, on
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:00.800]   internet infrastructure, which is woefully inadequate right now. We've suffered a month given that we
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.280]   invented the internet about the worst internet access of most developed nations, or at least the
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.240]   most costly. Net neutrality is going to play a big part. Oh thank God it's going to fix it all.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:18.560]   You know, I think when this whole thing was happening, me trying to get my family and friends on social
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.120]   media to understand how important it was, it was impossible. But I think when you start to deal
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:28.000]   with stuff like this in the future, that's when the average person is going to care about the net
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.040]   neutrality laws. And 5G. Yeah. And maybe who knows Starlink.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:41.200]   You know, it could be Elon. Sometimes you see this in technology where you've got trajectories
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.840]   of different technologies that don't make sense by themselves. But at some point in the future,
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:51.920]   they're going to converge. I think the internet was an example of that. And one of the things
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.560]   people always say to me when we talk about these kinds of futures is, well, that's going backwards.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.120]   That's back to when you have a central mainframe and you had thin clients and all the computing was
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:07.440]   done over there. And we got out of that. We put a PC on every desktop and that changed the world.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.600]   Aren't we just going back to that other old client server?
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:19.840]   It's like all these networks that are launching their own streaming services now. It's like
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:26.320]   $10 here, $14 here. Now it's like, wait a minute, if I pay for all these services,
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:33.120]   I'm actually paying more than I paid for direct TV. And eventually, you know,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.520]   someone's going to come along and they're going to try to aggregate all those services into one
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.240]   server and you're right back to cable and satellite again.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.680]   And if you look at the video game industry, it is going the exact opposite direction of the
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:51.360]   movie and television industry where the video game industry in its entire history has been
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   all a cart by the game, play it. And the TV industry was like, oh my gosh, you know what we
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.280]   could do? Instead of having to pay for a network to get a television show, we'll just sell you the
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.520]   television show all a cart. Meanwhile, the video game industry is going, that's fine.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:11.760]   We like that. We'll be like channel of video games. It's like they're crossing ships crossing in,
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.680]   you know? Yeah. Well, sometimes you feel like people are in the technology industry are throwing
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.880]   spaghetti against the wall and they just they don't they don't have a great coherent plan,
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.760]   but they're they're hoping something. Now, now, here's here's my philosophical question for all three of
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:31.520]   you. A lot of this presumes that gaming in 10 years is going to look a lot like gaming today.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.960]   Is there there's not a lot of precedent for that? I think for a while, everybody was
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   all excited about virtual reality. That seems to have kind of was there a lot of VR at E3?
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.800]   No, I'm still excited about VR. That's because you're a weirdo, Jeff.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:50.480]   But there was no VR at E3 this year. There was no VR at CES either. Well, no, there was an
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:55.120]   Oculus had a booth, but let me explain because I know Jeff is a huge proponent of VR. So let me
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:00.160]   state my point first and then you can follow up. I've been going to E3 for 27 years. I've gone
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:05.280]   the last six or seven years for the last four or five years. Every booth you went to had this
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.840]   little roped off area outside it where that publisher would be showing its token VR game.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.840]   And in a lot of ways that was to try to get people into the booth to check out their other stuff.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:19.840]   All that is gone now. Like we just did our best to be three awards yesterday and finding like a
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.560]   really good VR game wasn't that tough, but finding one that anyone's actually heard of was almost
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.920]   impossible. In fact, the game that I picked, the game called pistol whip, my co-host had never even
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.960]   heard of the game. Like just got announced in E3. It was announced. It was just announced.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:39.920]   But I mean, look, we're we're hardcore. Like we follow games. I mean, we use sifted. And if you
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.280]   don't, if you're not hardcore, you would look at sifted and be like, this is insane. But
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.000]   we've both been proponents of VR, but I don't think there's any denying, Jeff, that at the show
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.080]   this year, it was the least represented ever since it kind of became a thing.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:57.040]   Jeff, tell me, Vive, Rift, when you publish on VR, what is it?
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.200]   Well, I have all of them. Yeah. What do you play?
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:08.720]   Well, I mean, I just got a quest and I think that it represents a real new step in opening that
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:13.360]   technology up to a whole new audience. You have this standalone, well, really effectively a console.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.120]   Now I've been describing VR headsets as a display device for a long time.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:17.680]   Yes, that's right.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.920]   And Quest, I think really is a console.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:24.400]   That's the new Oculus. And Sheryl, and you're not in your head. You like the Oculus Quest?
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.000]   I've heard a lot of really good things about it. My colleague, Devinjour, reviewed it,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.360]   and he is really bullish about it. My biggest experience with VR is at film festivals,
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:38.000]   try back up because they're also big on VR there. And the sense I'm getting is that
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.680]   really for the near future, for the short term, VR is going to be good as a location-based experience.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:52.560]   And so when I went to Vegas, for example, VR experiences, VR arcades that you could go and
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.360]   visit while you're, I guess, not losing your money at the slots.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:02.080]   And people are drawn to some of these experiences for now just to kind of check it out. But as
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.640]   technology progresses and as these headsets get better, like the Oculus Quest and I'm hoping
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:12.880]   as future generations, I don't think every household will have a VR headset, but I think it'll start
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:18.960]   becoming more common. And yeah, perhaps now is in the time we're seeing a lot of hope and excitement
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   for VR. But I think I'm with Jeff here in that, like, I am so hopeful that VR gaming is going to be
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.880]   so like the future because it's so immersive and so exciting.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.880]   Oh, God, you guys look like Dork says looks like this is straight out of Ready Player One.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.200]   This is like, how dorky can you get?
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.000]   I am the one who has been hyped for 5G, so you should expect that.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.520]   All right. I wish the Quest had been what came out first because I think a lot of people
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.120]   got sort of the early revs of VR as their first taste of VR. And a lot of people maybe got
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:55.200]   more-- I get motion sickness with some VR games and I think a lot of people experience that first
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.560]   play and the Quest really is great VR. There's no wires, there's no tethers, another thing that's
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:06.080]   really bothered a lot of people. And so it is odd that, you know, finally, I feel like Quest is
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.720]   what we've been waiting for, but then there was hardly any representation of the medium at one of
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:16.480]   the biggest game shows in the world. So I agree, Quest is kind of what I think the future of VR
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.080]   is going to be. And I just hope there's enough support so it can kind of get on its feet.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.600]   So our 16-year-old and his buddies, they all play, we have a vibe, we have all of them too,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:32.000]   except for the Quest. And they play wireless with the Vive. And that seems like they really
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:40.080]   enjoy it. I still don't-- a lot of what they do is office tasks. It's like, I'm watching them.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:45.600]   And they're playing-- they're like stapling things. It's like, wait a minute. Are they playing
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:51.520]   job simulators? It's a great game. You know, the sequel, I'll just plug the sequel vacation
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.320]   simulator where I play one of the main characters. Oh, you're in that? I'll have to tell them I know
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:01.040]   that guy. Because they play that all the time. I play efficiency bot in vacation simulation.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:06.320]   You're kidding me. Oh my god, I know a celebrity. You're going to make my name at home.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:13.680]   Let me just pitch this idea to you real quick. What if-- I think that there will be a time,
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.800]   not far off, where we're marrying these two things that we've just been talking about,
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:27.760]   where we have standalone VR headsets and streaming video games so that when you are able to stream
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:34.320]   high-quality video images into the headset, it takes-- what's that? Everywhere. You're not--
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:40.240]   and it takes the horsepower out of the hands of the headset so they can be lighter and
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.320]   more comfortable and less cumbersome. Tell me about the Quest. So I still need a computer.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:49.520]   This is just a wireless VR. No, you do not need a computer. Computer's built into the thing.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:54.960]   Yes. It is a standalone device completely. It has inside-out tracking so you need no external
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   trackers. You can walk out in your backyard or walk over the front-down. What's the resolution?
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:04.080]   Is it as good as an Oculus? It's about comparable to the first Rift, maybe slightly better.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.480]   There's still some of that screen-doring that you see from the first, but it is a really high-quality
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:14.400]   experience. It's fast enough. Super quick between the moment you put it on and the moment you're
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:20.960]   playing. Literally, all you do, you put it on your face, you draw a line around you of how far
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:27.280]   is safe for you to swing your arms, and then you go. It is super slick. It has removed all of the
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:32.640]   cumbersome elements of all the cables and all the sensors and everything, and you just play.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.760]   And I have gotten so many emails from people saying, "Oh my gosh, I was into VR, but I tried
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:47.680]   Quest. It's amazing." This is the future. And I think I truly do believe that my kids are going
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.480]   to think it was weird that we played on 2D screens the same way they thought it was weird that I had
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.600]   a box under my television. I think this is where we're headed if fully immersive video game is all
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:06.400]   around you. Wow, I know. I thought it was history, but okay. I guess I'm wrong. I'll accept that,
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.360]   and I'll have to go get one of these. If a company has had more shallow pockets,
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.080]   it would have been over. But the good news is you have companies like Facebook who are fronting it,
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   and they can afford to take the losses up front. How about Scarlett? So Microsoft announced their
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:25.040]   next generation Xbox. It will be available next year. Actually, there'll be two of them.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.640]   One will be essentially the equivalent of the existing Xbox, and the other one will be Project
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:38.960]   Scarlett. We don't know what the name is. 8K graphics. Of course, the current X was supposed to
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:44.000]   do 4K graphics, but there were no 4K games. So this will probably be 4K graphics, right? This
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.200]   will be like real 4K graphics than cheating 8K. And then they'll check or board the 8K.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.000]   And what's exciting about this? You sound like, Cheryl, and you were kind of excited about Scarlett.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.640]   Oh, I just kind of heard the specs. And I was like, oh, that sounds a lot like the PS5 specs
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.200]   that we heard. And they are, aren't they? Yeah, they're the same. Yeah, they're basically the same.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.800]   So they're going to compete head to head again, and it would just boil down to the games again.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:16.320]   And, you know, let me ask a question. Why do they both use AMD parts processors?
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:22.400]   Deals. It's just cheaper. Yeah, I think it's just the deals that they've made in inter company deals.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:28.800]   But the future, according to both of these companies, the future is hard drives. The future is SSDs.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:33.680]   The biggest selling point on both of these systems is faster SSDs. No loading times.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.040]   Yeah. Well, that's true. Bumps of the speed quite a lot, right? The interstitial time, I think,
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:43.520]   for the Spider-Man game that they demoed on the PS5 was just 10 times faster or something,
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:50.560]   which, for gamer, could be like a huge difference. One point about AMD, by the way,
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.880]   I don't know that it's just deals. I think, yes, there's a lot of that. I think that AMD has made
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:01.360]   a lot of improvements in his graphics cards lately. And, you know, that might be, I mean, not that,
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:08.160]   not that like it's the only, I mean, the RTX stuff is in there if I'm not wrong, right? I'm not
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.600]   fully caught up on what else in there. Yeah, that's the idea is that there will be RTX and ray tracing.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:19.760]   We don't know exactly what these things are going to be able to do, but evidently ray tracing
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:24.240]   will be a big part of the next generation. And then these faster SSDs that they say will
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.840]   allow them to use the hard drive as virtual RAM. That's how fast they are.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   And the benefit of ray tracing is much more realistic lighting and scenes because they're generating
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:39.600]   it's a ray trace of the image in real time. Yeah, I never thought anybody could ever do.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:46.560]   It's an amazing thing, right? It's a little bit deeper than that. This was explained to me by
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.600]   somebody who said that, you know, their games are very expensive to make and they're very time
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:56.080]   consuming to make. And one of the things that's expensive and time consuming is building out these
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:02.240]   scenes where you have to fake all of the lighting. You have to tell the engine to put lighting here
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:07.120]   and here and here to make it look realistic. And what ray tracing will let you do is not have to
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:13.040]   fake it. Right. Is just make a scene and then say, here's where light comes from. And it does.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:18.240]   Yeah. All the rest for you. It computes it instead of you having to, you know, say,
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:25.840]   formulate all that and trick the systems into creating something that's realistic.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:34.160]   It's just behaving like actual light, which could conceivably make the production of games easier.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.880]   Production easier. It's a resource hog though. That's why it's taken so long. Ray tracing has
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:44.080]   been a thing since I remember when they were first talking about the Nintendo GameCube.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.680]   They were like talking about ray tracing. So it's been a thing for a long time,
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.360]   but now we just finally have the hardware capable of pulling it off in real time.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:57.840]   So, you know, I think I had a ray tracer on my old 80, my old XT PC XT.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.240]   Did let it run overnight. Over night.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.400]   He's amazing billiard balls. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:10.880]   Specular highlights. Yeah. Wow. I mean, it makes it more realistic. I was
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.960]   playing that, not playing, but watching that doom or what was a quake that they read,
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:19.200]   read it in ray tracing was pretty impressive. It's amazing technology.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:25.280]   So, but my question and I kind of got sidetracked by VR. I had no idea that Jeff was such a proponent.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.680]   And by the way, I just bought an Oculus Quest. Thank you, Jeff.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.280]   Why are you sitting there? You're a ball one. Yeah. Amazing.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.160]   I'm a multitasker. Then you know what? My job here is done.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.800]   Yeah. You convinced me. Well, I can't. I mean, I've been the guy saying, oh, yeah,
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:47.360]   that was a fad like 3D and it's over. So I can't say that I can't be justified saying that if I
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:53.680]   haven't tried the. Okay. Here we go. You are a driver. Beat Saber, Moss, super hot,
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:59.440]   Vader immortal. I think I have all of those on the rift. Can I mean, I already own them, right?
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:03.200]   Several of them you are cross by. I don't. I don't think Beat Saber or super hot hard,
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.880]   but maybe they need them across. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. The kids like super hot.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.960]   Very good. It's very good. But that was going to be my question was, is what is the
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.120]   future? What are games going to look? We're not going to be playing call of duty infinite ghost
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:22.320]   recon warfare 2025, are we or are we? I think you will. Oh God. How do I think with the
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:28.000]   East four? I mean, the East four feeds into it though. I could believe Mortal Kombat 11. Are you
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.960]   kidding me? Yeah. I mean, he's for the big deal though. Yeah. So yeah, I'll check your
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:39.280]   Viper sex. Is that the don't play the striking Viper? That's the, uh, that's the Black Mirror
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.560]   game. Oh, I haven't seen that ever since the new season yet. Okay.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.800]   It has some functionality in it. That's a little surprising.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:51.040]   But I don't think it's an Oculus Quest yet.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:57.840]   So, well, okay. Maybe not. Maybe the, maybe first person shooters are the
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:04.560]   Cinequan Ultra of gaming. There's nothing. I think anything that has a big
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:08.880]   eSports scene is going to be hard for it to change too much. It's like how much
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.600]   you can wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The rules of the NFL. Yeah, but wait a minute.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.960]   We thought League of Legends was the eSports thing until Fortnite came out, right?
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.200]   I think League of Legends is still a bigger and better long term play than Fortnite.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:27.360]   Really? Yeah, absolutely. League of Legends is never going away. It's just gigantic. Like,
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:31.600]   you see all these other games come and go and League just, it's a rock.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:36.240]   Interesting. And it's, it's also one of those games that literally you could play for the rest
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:40.480]   of your life and always get better at. Do you think it's interesting? It's very interesting to me that
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:46.880]   the Epic bought, creators of Fortnite bought House Party because it really feels like
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:52.480]   Fortnite has become a social network for 12 year olds. Yeah. And House Party is the video
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.280]   component of that. Yeah. I mean, they did that stuff where they had, they've had like live
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:02.480]   concerts inside of Fortnite already. Yeah. Right. Epic's been pretty progressive in how it's
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:06.800]   handling the marketing of its video games. It's done things that no one else, I'm sure others
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.240]   have thought of, but just didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on. But I mean,
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.360]   that concert, what do they have? 10 million people watching a fake concert inside Fortnite or something?
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:19.120]   I mean, just think about the business. By the way, I saw that nervous. It wasn't simultaneously.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:21.840]   They came, right. It came and went. Yeah. Yeah. But still,
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:26.640]   there's a lot of people. Thinking about if you're Britney Spears or whoever, I mean,
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:34.960]   you could have a virtual concert in Fortnite and probably make more money than you would if you did
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:41.520]   a real concert at a stadium. So it's just opening up all kinds of avenues to bring other pop culture
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:47.040]   into the industry. And I think it's good overall because if someone just downloads Fortnite to go
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.600]   watch a concert of some pop star, and then maybe they start playing Fortnite. And then they're like,
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.280]   hey, I kind of like this. And then maybe they buy a console and then they start buying other games.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:59.680]   So when stuff like that acts as a Trojan horse, a lot of hardcore gamers are reluctant. I think
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.920]   it's great because it's always bringing new people into the market. I have to say three years ago
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.560]   was Battle Royale a category that everybody was excited about. I mean, there's definitely
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:15.040]   been a shift in that regard. I guess it's still first person shooter, but with slightly different.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.800]   There's always going to be a next big thing. Yeah. It's something's the biggest thing in the
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.160]   world until something else is the biggest thing in the world. That's what I'm wondering.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.880]   There if you look at the only analog I could think of for gaming is the movie industry.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.920]   If you look at the movie industry, there were watersheds. 1967 was a watershed for the movie
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.080]   industry. When cameras got small enough, they didn't have to do it in a sound stage.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.040]   In a back lot, they could make a movie in the field and Bonnie and Clyde got made and a whole,
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.680]   I mean, it just changed the world for movies. Is that going to happen in gaming or no?
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.080]   Is it just going to be? Yes. It's good. I think it has kind of happened already.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:58.560]   Has it? We're seeing that there was a time when video games started where it was a bunch of
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:05.680]   technical people who created video games because you had to be technical to program a video game
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.760]   and interface with a computer and make it do what you wanted it to do? In those days,
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.640]   one person wrote a whole game. Right. Or a couple of people in the garage, right? But it was
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.480]   technical people and technical people that were trying to create art. What you're seeing is
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:27.760]   happening now with Unity being ostensibly free and incredibly powerful and very easy to use.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.120]   That these tools are being put in the hands of artists who aren't technical people. Writers,
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:40.800]   designers, and they're able to use this medium to express their art without having the technical
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.120]   know-how to do it because the tools are so intuitive and easy to use and accessible.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.200]   What's an example of that? Is uncharted an example of that? What's an example of that?
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.600]   No, I mean, it's not sure the tons of indie games that are built on Unity, but there's tons
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.200]   of them. I mean, it's not just Unity. It's unreal. All the middleware programs,
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.480]   middleware and developing games. They're all basically copy and paste applications that
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.320]   I wouldn't say anyone could learn how to use, but if you're dedicated and you're at least moderately
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.040]   intelligent, you can learn how to make a video game now in 2019. Whereas the area that Jeff was
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.800]   alluding to, that was impossible unless you took programming classes and became a programmer.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:20.720]   Shane, you know the next level of this is something like dreams.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.160]   There's a game. More simple like Super Mario Maker. I mean, it's right.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:33.120]   What's dreams? Tell me about dreams. Dreams is a Sony game quote-unquote game, but it's really
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:38.560]   an incredibly robust tool set that is still in beta right now, but even in beta, people are
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:44.880]   posting that they have created a new X-Wing game. Hasn't those been around with level designers?
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.040]   I mean, for years and years and years. But these tools are becoming so
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:56.080]   accessible and so, so. Yeah, exactly. Intuitive and easy to use that I think you're going to see,
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.280]   there's an entire generation of kids who want to create but aren't programmers that are going to
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.360]   have the ability to actually make games. And I think we're going to see more and more of that with
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.320]   Mario Maker with dreams with these kinds of. It feels like they're going a little bit on Rails
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.800]   though, because every game I see looks a lot like every other game. And then there's an occasional
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:20.720]   something like Journey, which is an indie game that's very different, but that's not going to be a
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.200]   billion dollar game either. Well, but it doesn't have to be right. You don't have to make a movie.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.800]   I guess movies are kind of like that too. I mean, now we're in the Marvel universe, right?
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.000]   But then there's still indie movies that are different. They're their art house films.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.480]   So is that the kind of egoistic we're creating? Yeah, the indie game scene is incredibly vibrant
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.840]   and beautiful. And there's the indie mega booth at E3 every year and at PAX and all these places.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.840]   And you go there and you see some of the most outside the box thinking and beautiful expression
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:59.760]   using video games to explore depression or explore real issues like you see filmmakers using the
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:06.000]   film medium to do. And I think that is because artists who aren't technical people now have access
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.040]   to this medium. And you don't have to make a billion dollar game. It's this start. You can
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.920]   start there and you make a great game. Next thing, big studios like Naughty Dog or Nintendo are
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.800]   calling you and saying, Hey, we like what you're doing. Like come on, come and work with us.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.360]   Look at Double Fine. Just Microsoft. Just double fine.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:29.200]   Yep, they were an indie developer. Yeah. And just just last week, Google announced their new game
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.040]   builder. Yeah, he's going to open up the... Imagine the kids who play Minecraft today
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.360]   who are building in Minecraft, but building a somewhat constrained universe suddenly
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.800]   start using the same kinds of tools to create games. Yeah, this is why I'm so encouraged. Leo,
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   you talk about, you know, sort of being depressed by the next Call of Duty, Warfare, Death, Vicon.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:56.480]   And I'm a little bit in that boat too. But I think there is an entire generation that was
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:03.120]   raised on Minecraft that look at video games as a creation tool. And that is an interesting...
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:08.720]   Incredibly exciting. Yeah, that is an interesting development. I actually, people often, I'm a big
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.200]   proponent of getting your 10 year old, 11 year old to play Minecraft. People say, well, that's just a
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:19.280]   game. Sometimes I say, well, we played Lego. We played with Lego bricks. This is Lego bricks.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.720]   But honestly, I think Minecraft teaches you coding, really. And the kinds of skills you're
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.920]   learning and putting these things together and making this world is the beginning of a coding
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:38.800]   mindset that can then evolve. And maybe coding is going to change. Maybe these kinds of new tools
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:44.160]   to build games. That's the new coding, the future of coding. Well, yeah, I think the tools generate
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.640]   the code. Just drag and drop copy and paste. And then underneath the hood, it's just generating
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.080]   the code for you. Yeah. At the risk of sounding too old, I mean, coding has already changed a lot.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:06:00.160]   It's gotten a lot easier than before. I mean, there's playgrounds for what was Apple's Swift, I think?
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:06.160]   Swift playground, yeah. And, you know, so many programs, so many languages that are designed to
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:11.360]   make coding languages easier to learn. I just learned about this intermediate language. It teaches
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.600]   you how to do C or something like that. I was like, why can't you just learn C? But I guess it
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.080]   makes things easier and more accessible, which is a good thing. I was brought up on like HTML
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:26.000]   one daughter and like, I learned C++ job on PHP growing up and it's like, why do you need all
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.480]   these things to learn differently? Welcome to my world. I'm twice as old as you. You're
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:36.800]   not like Pascal and basic. Yeah. I'm still writing. I'm still writing Lisp code. So you guys,
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:42.000]   you just, you wait for a snack. By the way, Lisp is coming. Lisp is coming back. It's, yeah,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:51.760]   on cassette, I loaded up. Yeah. Assembly robust, baby. Is Nintendo still a thing?
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:58.960]   Yeah. It's a great one E three, in my opinion. It won E three. Oh, yeah. I mean,
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:03.120]   it's, but you got to realize right now the switch is mid cycle. It's in the sweet spot. I mean,
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.920]   it's in it's year three. This is where everything coalesces into a great platform. All your first
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.360]   party efforts in development, all the third parties are on board, particularly if it's
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.440]   successful like the switch is Nintendo is getting third party support with switch that it hasn't
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.640]   had since the game cube. So I knew this when my kids said, you know, this 128 gig SD card you
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.080]   gave me is too small. Do you have anything bigger? Yeah. Nintendo brought the games to E three. It
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.560]   literally brought four bangers like four games that are probably going to sell close to 10 million
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:35.760]   or more by the time it's all said and done. It announced a new Zelda at E three. These other guys
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.080]   are wrapping up the generation and we're kind of in this transition period between saying goodbye to
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.320]   PlayStation four and saying hello to PlayStation five, which is another reason why Sony wasn't at
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.320]   E three. It didn't have a lot of games to show because they're saving them up for the big splash
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.040]   for PlayStation five. Yeah. So Nintendo is just like here it is. Like we need you to guide guys to
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:58.160]   buy games. We're not worried about our next platform yet. And so it pretty much one E three by default,
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.440]   but it did have a good show. I think it's really interesting to see the kind of more traditional
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:12.320]   Nintendo games like Zelda and Mario and then the Witcher. Yeah. On a switch. The Witcher. Wow.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.160]   Nintendo fans have been begging for that for like five years. Resident evil. Oh my god.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:23.040]   The switch is a real departure for Nintendo as far as the support they've gotten. It's a real
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:29.280]   gaming platform. Yeah. Yeah. And it's great for indie games too. It's the it's the best indie game
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:35.520]   platform bar none in my opinion. What? Why is that? They they have got a ton of support for
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:42.320]   indie games. They they have this Nindi's initiative that they have actually put a lot of support behind
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:48.240]   a lot of promotional support behind these independent games. And it's just a delightful platform to
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.480]   play some of these smaller titles on because you can play it on the go. So it's a marriage of
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.840]   of great form factor with content. And you can play some of that some spectacular experiences
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:02.800]   on this thing. Then there's so many of them. Lots of exclusive indie games for Switch now too. It used
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.200]   to be an indie game would be announced and it would be always be announced for PC and PlayStation
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.160]   4 for four years straight. It was that way and then the switch came and now all those games are
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.440]   either Switch exclusive for like a few months or it's PC and Switch first and then the other
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.720]   platforms to follow. So indie developers anecdotally have been saying that their games sell far more
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.120]   on Switch and they do on other console platforms. So it's just been kind of a perfect storm.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:34.640]   I'll be darned. Yeah. It's funny because before the switch came out everybody was saying it's
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.400]   over for Nintendo. Yeah. Oh, the Wii U was every generation since SNES they said that for Nintendo.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:45.680]   Yeah. That's true. They have a core of fans that are strong enough to get Nintendo through
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.880]   its rough patches and it also has just billions and billions of dollars in cash. Nintendo would
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.360]   have to have like three or four complete and utter failure generations before it would even be in
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.040]   danger of going out of business. I didn't realize that. That's interesting. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It is
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.200]   sitting on a mountain of cash in Japan. Absolutely. All right. Wow. Well, I feel like we've we've
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:14.400]   done the E3 tour thanks to a really great panel Shane Satterfield is here. My old colleague from
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:21.920]   Tech TV and X-Play. Now it's sifted games as sifted.net S I F T D dot net, which is apps I'm going to
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.280]   join. I'm going to sign up on Patreon because clearly I need to figure out what the hell to do
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:36.080]   with this new Oculus that I spent by the way $666 on. I think that that's a little bit telling.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.280]   I don't think you regret it. I really don't. I think you're going to be impressed.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.520]   Nuts to buy the canhand controllers. It looks like everybody's. No, no, you got to have that.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.640]   You got to have that. Yeah. And then I got an extra face mask.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:52.240]   Fast mask because those things get sweaty as hell. That's experience. Somebody with experience.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:11:01.040]   Anyway, great to have you Shane. Sherlin. Hello is here and we're going to put you to work in a
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.560]   second reviews editor and Engadget. There's lots of other stuff to talk about, including the Pixel
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:13.600]   4, Jeff Kanata, another colleague from Days Gone By at Jeff Kanata.com and the brand new
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:20.320]   Dungeon Runner podcast available on YouTube, wherever podcasts are, or you can watch it on caffeine.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.760]   And I'll be watching that too, I think. Thanks. Is there VR dungeon gaming?
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:32.320]   I'm sure there are lots of VR games set in dungeons. Sure. Yeah, it'd be fun if you could be the
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:38.240]   dungeon master in a virtual world. Yeah, you know, I we're working on that. We're working on it, Jeff.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:45.120]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by something I actually enjoy more than gaming
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:53.120]   sleeping. In particular, Casper, my mattress, my mattress of choice. Oh, I love this new mattress.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:58.800]   They actually just started out with a new hybrid met. There it is. The hybrid met. Yes, I'm wearing
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:05.280]   jammies because I can't wait to get in bed. The Casper hybrid mattress collection is something new
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.640]   for Casper combines the pressure relief of their award-winning foam, but has, and you won't really
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:17.760]   know this until you lie on it. Kind of this durable yet gentle spring. So the Casper, like all Casper
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:24.320]   mattresses, comes in a surprisingly compact box. This was a California king. And as soon as you open
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:31.200]   it up, it opens up smells great. By the way, there's no need to air it. It is an, yes, it's a very
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.960]   comfortable mattress. But the reason I like this new mattress is there's better lift. So it's very
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.240]   active support and very durable for all body types. I, as you might have noticed, have a certain kind
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.600]   of pear-shaped form, but it can handle it. The airflow within the spring network is even better,
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:54.080]   which means you sleep cool. And here's the thing I really like. Enhanced edge support. So if you're
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:13:00.240]   like me and you're getting out of your bed and the mattress gives and you fall out of bed half the
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:06.880]   time, you will love this new Casper mattress. Enhanced edge support gives it a firmer perimeter,
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.000]   so it's easier to get in that bed. I know maybe that's just a Leo thing, but I am so
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.240]   happy with this new Casper. Get your new Casper mattress. And the best part about Casper is
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:25.520]   you can try it for a hundred days at no risk, free delivery, painless returns in the US and Canada
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.600]   within a hundred nights. So if you don't like it, you call them up. They take it back or fund you
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.840]   every penny. And even the new mattress with the springs comes in that little box that is easy to
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.720]   get into the house, easy to get where you want it to be. Open it up and your mattress is there.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:47.360]   I love my Casper mattress. Casper changed the mattress business by realizing that there was this
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:54.160]   huge inefficiency in the mattress stores. And by eliminating that, by cutting out the middleman,
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:59.760]   they give you the best mattress as ever for a fraction of the cost. They've got bed frames
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.080]   bedding and now they have this new glow light, by the way, which I love that'll help you fall
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:09.440]   asleep. Casper has everything you need to get a perfect sleep environment. Sleep is the most
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:17.680]   important meal of the day. So enjoy it. At Casper.com/twit1, use the promo code "Twit1" and you can get a

[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:48.640]   Google, I think this is the best thing ever. There were pictures coming out of the Pixel 4,
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:56.080]   I guess leaks in the case manufacturing and so forth. So Google says, well, since there seems
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.760]   to be some interest, here's pictures. This is what it's going to look like. That's the best way to
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:07.360]   handle leaks, right? Isn't that awesome? Poor Mark is Brownly says, please let me drop my dream
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:14.960]   phone 2019 video first to which Google responds, well, the 2019 is not over dude. Maybe you'll want
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.840]   to wait. We don't know it'll come out, but in the past it's October, right? Sherlyn?
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:28.080]   Yep. Typically Google releases the flagship pixels in October. This is a little bit of a
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:34.240]   behind the scenes story from my point of view. I was manning my new shift, which for us means
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.680]   watching all the feeds and then assigning people to write it as fast as possible.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:45.440]   Then I saw that we come up and I was like, that cannot be right. That cannot be right. Google
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.800]   goes and I was like, has Google A ever leaked itself? And B, is this the first official video
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.960]   we're seeing of the Pixel 4 and Google just confirmed the Pixel 4 basically?
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:02.000]   Like five months early. Yeah. Earlier that day, it was the first leak we'd ever saw, I think,
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:08.960]   that was substantial of the Pixel 4 with the from the case design people. So, obviously we had
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.240]   someone just jump on it. We had our posts go up as soon as we could. But just the whole like, I
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:20.960]   having been in communication with Google all throughout the Pixel 3 launch,
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:26.960]   I don't think, I mean, I think this is a very refreshing approach. I think that
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:34.000]   I haven't seen a major tech company do this yet. Imagine Apple doing this. Apple would never
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.920]   imagineable. Apple is so precious with its information. They're like, we want to surprise
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.800]   and delight. I'll show viewers keynote viewers really. You want to surprise and delight them.
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:51.360]   And I think that Google doing this shows that it has confidence that it has even more to show
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:57.360]   come October, which boats well. And I mean, if we're going to talk about the picture itself,
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.840]   I mean, they tweeted out just one picture. I say that much. All we know now is a camera bump.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:08.160]   The square camera bump is real. And it's got two lenses. Yeah, what looks like two lenses and
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.200]   some sort of the flashlight and then like a third thing. The sensor. Yeah.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:19.040]   It's a sensor time of flight sensor type of thing. I mean, given that the Pixel 3 was, you know,
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:25.120]   in our camera shoot out already the best camera with just one, you know, sensor on there.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.840]   And it beat out the likes of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, I think, and the Samsung Galaxy S
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:37.440]   nine plus or the Note 9 back then, as well as the iPhone XS given that it's already beat all
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:44.800]   its competitors with just one sensor. I think that Google could have just so much to show off in
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:51.600]   terms of what its camera can do. It's smart because it just gets the buzz going. It's a little early,
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.920]   but it's still getting the buzz going. And they didn't reveal anything. They didn't even show the
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.560]   front of the phone. We don't know if it has a headphone jack. We don't know if there's how big
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.520]   the bezels are. We don't know anything really, except for this camera bump, which is so it's good.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:13.280]   It's a little T. It's a black rectangle. Oh my God. And I'm curious. I'm
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:19.040]   curious. I got less than 50,000 likes. I mean, Google's what third in the US market right now
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:23.280]   for phones fastest growing, I think though, right? That's a good one. I think it is because it was
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:28.400]   tweeted out of their mate by Google account, which isn't them as, you know, followed as their main.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.920]   Yeah. Whereas, you know, I'm sure if you look at like maybe Marquez's tweet of it or another
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.800]   publication tweet about the news, those probably got like a ton of likes. Yeah, they only have
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:48.320]   253,000 followers. Yeah. Marquez has 3.26 million followers. There's a little teeny-weeny difference.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:55.040]   I'll tell you. Do you know the chatroom saying, well, Apple does this, but they do it
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.360]   surreptitiously with leaks, with like controlled leaks. Do you believe that,
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:06.240]   Sherlin, that Apple intentionally leaks out information? I do not believe in the idea of
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.240]   controlled leaks. I think that people believe it and power to you. If you think that is the case,
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.360]   I think we've been accused of being controlled leaks before. And because that's not the case,
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.000]   I am against that very notion. Like people think that Apple has reporters in his pocket.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.640]   Maybe it does. I don't know. I don't know everything that goes on in this world,
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:32.880]   but a lot of us are not in any company's pocket. And it is actually borderline offensive when
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.520]   people say that. I agree with you. Yeah. But when people say controlled leaks, I mean,
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.320]   yeah, if you're talking about PR stud, if you're talking about marketing stud,
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.960]   that comes through its own channels, that's different. When you're accusing a publication of
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.040]   being a mouthpiece for a site, you got to be very careful about what you're saying here,
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.560]   I think. Because I don't know. Again, maybe some sites do do it, but there are legitimate
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:59.280]   publications that refuse to. And that's not what we do.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:06.480]   I mean, sometimes people accuse the Wall Street Journal, for instance, of being an Apple's back
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:14.480]   pocket. But if an Apple employee came to you and said, here's something interesting.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.480]   That's a good source. That doesn't mean you're. Yeah. And we're still, but the thing is,
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.920]   here's the difference of a controlled leak versus a publication that's covering something that a
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.760]   source came to you with, right? If it's a controlled leak, you're not going to like,
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.720]   you're going to see whatever the company told you to say maybe. You got a good source from the Apple
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.640]   and like at the assembly line, you get the case, you get whatever the news is, and then you make
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.640]   your own judgment about, hey, whether there's newsworthy, even enough to publish B, what your
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:49.120]   take on it is it verify your source. What's your source really credible? There's a lot of steps
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:54.240]   journalistically to prove these things. And that's not a controlled leak. I don't believe in that.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.000]   Certainly there are leakers. But what you're saying is a kind of a tit for tat will give you
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.560]   the cover of the magazine. If you give us some inside information, that kind of thing.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.560]   That's not that's not. Yeah. I mean, I think that's not sure. I agree with you.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:13.200]   No, I mean, I have a new rep. I mean, you look at a lot of magazines, they get a cover
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.880]   story, even in gaming, you know, get a cover story on a game. And they're the first ones who get
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:21.600]   to play it. They're the first ones who get access to it. And now that most magazines have a digital
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.840]   element of their business, all that stuff goes on YouTube and they get the exclusive on all that
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:31.120]   information before anyone else. So it's not out of the ordinary. You would do that though.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:36.960]   Who me? They would never give it to us. Our publication is a big enough. Yeah.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.640]   Yeah. I think getting an exclusive is different from again, getting like
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:49.120]   is a sort of deal. No, it is because you don't want to be a PR arm of a company you cover.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:54.240]   That's not right. I mean, it's a company. So, no, if you're still exercising your
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.440]   journalistic like integrity in what you're reporting is like, if something is bad, call it out for
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:04.480]   being bad. You're exclusive. If it's all sunshine and roses, then there's suspicion of like,
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:10.720]   is this really journalistic piece or is a PR? And that's kind of where the line is, right?
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.000]   I never have to worry about this because everybody hates me in the industry.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.040]   That's convenient. Yeah. I've made it that way over the years.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:26.480]   Yeah. So, there's weird to me that there would be, I mean, I guess politics does it. So maybe,
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.760]   maybe tech does it. Oh God. It seems Beltway journalism. That's the phrase.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:35.360]   Yeah. I can just seems odd to me that someone sitting in a room trying to promote a product
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.280]   would go, here's what we do. We don't point people to our channels.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:44.560]   We point them to other people's channels and give those other people's channels this cool tidbit
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:49.600]   of new. I just don't, I mean, I feel like it. We're not going to report it the way you want it. I mean,
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:54.800]   you can say you have a deal or whatever, but ultimately the journalist is the one who has to
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:59.600]   type up that article and that report and publish it. So, there's, there's some wiggle room in there
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:03.520]   for you to not get for things to not work out exactly how you hope for them to. That's right.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:08.400]   That's why there's like things like briefings and embargo briefings and stuff like that before
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.200]   a launch because, you know, a company like say Samsung or Google, whoever wants to make sure
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.160]   the messaging gets out correctly. And like, you know, reporting from a live event is very different
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:23.920]   from having been briefed about it a few days ago, because there you have time to process. You have
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.440]   time to be like, all right, let's fact check. Let's check out what the predecessor specs for.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:33.600]   Let's do all these comparison things that I can use to make my article much more like reliable and
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:38.240]   much more useful for my reader. Whereas like live from the event in the bustle of like a hands-on
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:42.880]   show floor, yeah, I can do all those things. But am I going to get every single piece of like
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:49.280]   information right from like a convention floor? It's harder to do that. It would take longer. So,
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.840]   then the end result is not as nice. And so for the company, sometimes they see that benefit.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:59.520]   It's I don't like, I mean, like I get how it can come off shady and it can come off like a
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.160]   collusion sometimes, especially when like company just handpicks who the hell they want to like
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:11.760]   brief. And that frustrates me a lot because we don't always get briefed. So it is it is something
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:17.040]   that I've had to like work out my personal struggle. It is it's very challenging. And I feel fortunate
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:24.160]   that I I don't have to deal with that. And I've always kept PR at arm's length as much as possible.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:29.360]   I know it except review units generally and stuff like that just because I don't want not only the
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.600]   appearance of collusion, I just don't want the pressure from these guys. I don't I don't they
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:39.920]   don't know my number. I don't want to hear from them. If we you know, and I basically free ride on
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:45.600]   you, Sherlyn, and I let and gadget do all the work. And then I just read your stories out loud,
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:53.120]   but I give them your number. I call Sherlyn and then I'll do the commentary. That's why I get
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:59.280]   all the PR commentary. That's well, you mentioned. Okay. So you said how good the pixel
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.960]   a three phone camera is. And then the chat rooms, some of the people in China are saying, well,
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:11.200]   what about the Huawei? What about the Mate 20 Pro, which is an excellent camera? Oh, yes. Yes.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.640]   That is good Lord. Such a good camera. Sorry. You're saying? Well, except you can't buy it in the US.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:23.760]   Yeah. Yeah. Hardware wise. They've they've achieved a lot while he has achieved a lot on that phone.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:29.360]   And it is a shame. I know it's it's what's your what's your take? In fact, I'm going to ask everybody,
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.800]   but let's start with you, Sherlyn. What's your take on what's going on with Huawei? Is it really a
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.000]   national security threat? Or is this a trade war against Huawei? They just announced they're
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.880]   not going to ship the Mate book now at all. Yeah. Yeah, which is a little bit of a loss. I'm using
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:51.440]   the Mate book first right now, literally, where we're doing this guy call. It's a great laptop.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.280]   It's really good. Huawei said, if it weren't for this embargo, we would probably be the number one
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:02.480]   phone manufacturer in the world. We're number two right now. We'd probably be number one.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:10.080]   They're number two without the US, which is like huge. So where I stand in terms of whether
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:14.560]   it's a national security ban or whether it's a national security threat versus a trade war thing,
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:19.680]   I think it's a bit of both. I think that there are things about Huawei that are suspicious.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:26.720]   And they have done sneaky stuff in the past, like steel stuff from T-Mobile and just not been very
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.600]   upfront and things that I hear off the grapevine that don't- Yes, but there's a difference between
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:39.040]   lousy, slimy industry practices, which is fairly widespread. I mean,
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.760]   Father Robert told me that he'd see Huawei guys go around at the end of the conference,
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:48.160]   taking pictures of other people's logic boards and things like that. Okay. But that's a big
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:53.680]   difference in that and national security and Chinese government spying and things like that.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:27:00.240]   I think that I honestly don't know if they have actually installed back doors on their chips,
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.520]   remotems or processors and- I don't think there's any evidence that they have.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:08.560]   There's no evidence. If there was, we wouldn't be in the situation we are in. If there was evidence,
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.360]   we would be done with this situation. We would be in the court like this.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.200]   You'd be all these going, yeah. Yeah. And of course, there's always the potential because they
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.560]   are a Chinese company. Any company that's operating out of China is legally bound if the Chinese
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.960]   government asks them to do things like that. But- But- Although, I think the Chinese government
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.440]   might think twice about sub-marining one of its most successful companies.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:37.120]   I have very little knowledge of what's going on in their Chinese operations.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:42.160]   I just know that it's suspicious. I do think that a lot of this is unwarranted.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:47.200]   But I know that there's a lot of people out there watching or listening to this that are going to
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.360]   have their own doubts and they can't be dissuaded in any way. So I honestly don't think that Huawei's
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:55.760]   claims of being able to sell their phones in the US making them the world's number one is
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.400]   that valid because there's people who was confident is shot already and they're just not going to
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.200]   buy it regardless. And we should point out Huawei has become the number one phone in China because
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.720]   of patriotism among Chinese customers who say, "Well, screw you, US, I'm buying a Huawei phone."
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:15.600]   Yeah, it's easy to discuss this without getting political. I think that's maybe the problem.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.040]   I don't know if you want to go ahead.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.240]   Yeah, political. Go ahead, Shana.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:18.800]   Let's go there.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.520]   You know how you'll know if this bogus is if we make a trade agreement with China and all of a
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.920]   sudden Huawei gear starts flooding the US again.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:26.800]   Right. Yeah.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.280]   Right.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:30.960]   I don't know. I just think that I hear from this administration. I tend to not believe a lot of
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.680]   the time and I kind of wait till I have real evidence of it. I don't know. Maybe that's the thing.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.200]   Yeah, that's what happens to credibility.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.120]   When you mix them up pretty soon, even if you're telling the truth, nobody knows whether to believe
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.080]   it or not.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.040]   Crying Wolf.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:45.440]   Yep.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:51.120]   Yeah. Crying Wolf. I feel bad because I do feel like Huawei's phones and Huawei's laptops
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:58.400]   are very, very good. And I think I have a P20. I would have loved to. But I had somebody call me
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.760]   and said, "Well, I have a Huawei phone. Should I get rid of it?" And I said, "Well, I guess so."
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:07.600]   Because unless Google changes its policy in three months, you won't get security patches.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.640]   And no one should use an Android phone that's not getting security patches.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:17.200]   I mean, again, I was out of vacation for a week where I thought they flipped flop, that decision.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:17.520]   And then...
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.400]   They said three months.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:23.600]   So now it's three months. Okay. So, but my cousin has a Huawei phone. He asked me about it.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.120]   And he was like, "Well, am I okay?" And I said, "You're going to be fine because
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:33.200]   all your apps are going to be able to run your third-party apps. Anyway, if you rely on Google's
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.840]   apps, you're going to be in a difficult situation. Huawei's going to push out its own mobile OS,
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:45.120]   but by like fall or sooner than we expected, I remember. And even though Huawei's not the best
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:53.760]   software player, they've surprised me so far with their hardware. So I wouldn't be too harsh on them
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.200]   or expecting too little from them at this point. I think I am bullish on them. I think they'll do
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:04.880]   better than I expected. I do think there's some form... There is a turnaround somewhere.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:11.840]   I don't see that this is it for Huawei in the US. And it would be a shame if we were the
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:16.880]   like your two or point, the Mate 20 Pro to back to that chatroom conversation. Seriously, the imaging
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:23.040]   on that phone is really great. The reason the Pixel 3.1 in the end was it was just a much simpler
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.480]   interface to use in addition to being great at processing images.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.640]   Nowadays, phones are so good. I don't think there's enough of a difference between the S10 plus,
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:40.800]   the iPhone XS, the Huawei. They're all very, very good. And I think it's personal almost a matter
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:44.320]   of personal taste, which one you like better. I'm actually a big fan of the S10 plus. I have
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:50.240]   all of them and I like the S10 plus. So there you go. Whatever DXO, some mark says,
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:55.440]   I still have the S10 plus. How about... So, Jeff, are you just going to stay out of this and say,
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:02.560]   dodge the bullet here? Well, certainly not my area of expertise, but I tend to have
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:08.800]   a bit of skepticism on any of the grand conspiracy theories. I mean, it seems like,
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:12.800]   who do you want spying on you, the Chinese government or our government? It's even on your...
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.800]   That's a good point, right? Or Facebook or Google or...
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:22.000]   Yeah. It is interesting to see. I just saw an Apple ad yesterday. I guess it was maybe it was
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.160]   day before in the playoffs where the Apple had a padlock on it that locked and then it turned
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:33.680]   into the Apple logo. And Apple's really doubling down on this notion that, well, we make a safe
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:38.160]   private secure phone. Those other guys may not. Was this an interesting...
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:43.440]   I think the evidence supports that. I mean, police have tried to go to Apple to get phones
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:48.240]   cracked. The authorities can't do it. So they beg Apple for help. I mean, I think the proof's
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.720]   kind of in the pudding on that one. And I think Apple recognizes that that is a legitimate
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:58.720]   selling point. I think that they can really double down on that messaging. And I think that
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:02.720]   will resonate with people. And they have a track record that they can draw from and say, hey,
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.000]   we've resisted on every level. And we have a pretty good track record on this. And I think
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:16.080]   I think that as we get farther and farther down the road of distrust in all of these companies,
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:20.400]   I think that might end up being something that draws people to that brand.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:26.480]   Although I have to point out, celebrate the Israeli firm that many law enforcement agencies
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:33.120]   use to crack into phones say, this is their tweet from June 14th. We're proud to introduce
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.520]   UFED Premium, an exclusive solution for law enforcement to unlock and extract data from all
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:42.880]   iOS and high-end Android devices. Sherlin, is that credible?
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:49.840]   I have no clue. This is the first time hearing of it. I think that there, as you could jailbreak
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.680]   your phone in the past, your iPhone in the past, there's always going to be a solution for you to
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:33:00.560]   be able to extract data from a phone that's purportedly locked. So hackers are always hard at work.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:06.960]   We'll always find a solution to this somewhere. I think we would just understand that your data is
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.160]   not super secure, if it's beamed anywhere. The best is on the phone.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:14.960]   We do know that. We know that from a number of sources that the minute you put a third-party
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:21.440]   app on your iPhone, forget it. I guess if you didn't put anything on your iPhone,
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:27.520]   maybe you'd have a chance of succeeding. That's why I only use Notepad and Calendar.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.320]   And Play Microsoft Solitaire. That's all anybody needs.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:37.200]   Right. Let's go back to 1997. The world was simpler. It was a lot better.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.320]   Can we? I wish we would. This is for a day.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.720]   All right. Let's take a break. Talking about MySpace. Facebook is going to launch its own
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.400]   cryptocurrency. Maybe even this week, we'll hear announcements about something called Project
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.920]   Libra, their global coin project. And there's some concerns about that. We'll talk about it in
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.480]   just a second. Great paneling here. Cherylin Lowe, I really appreciate your being here.
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:11.600]   She is a busy person. Reviews editor at Engadget.com. Cherylin Lowe on Twitter, C-H-E-R-L-Y-N-N-L-O-W.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:20.400]   Also with his Jeff Kanata, his new podcast, The Dungeon Runner. He is just dungeon run.
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.440]   Just dungeon run. Well, he's the dungeon runner though, in dungeon running.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.240]   I am. Right. You are the dungeon master. I am. The key master.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:36.320]   And that's on caffeine, but also YouTube and podcasts. And from sifted.net,
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.840]   Shane Satterfield. Great to have you, Shane as well. Given that you worked with me 20 years
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:48.640]   ago at tech TV, you should look a lot older. It wasn't that long ago, man. Oh, okay. Okay.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:53.840]   If you say so. But thank you for the compliment. I'll take it however I can get.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:59.520]   Yeah, I don't understand. I don't get it. You got a portrait in the basement somewhere.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.040]   I showed they brought to you by 1000 eyes. What a fascinating company.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:08.960]   And people who learn about 1000 eyes, I think often go, what? You can do that.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:16.560]   1000 eyes was created during graduate research at UCLA. Not so long ago. The goal was, how can we
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:21.760]   see what's going on in that puffy little thing they call the cloud? Now, let me tell you, if you have
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:27.120]   Internet services, Internet products, if you use the Internet to reach customers,
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:35.120]   you know what a scary thing this is because you can have complete control, complete visibility
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:39.600]   into your servers, into everything you're running. But the minute your stuff goes out on the public
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:45.040]   Internet, sky's the limit. Anything could happen. And when something goes wrong on the Internet,
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:51.040]   it may not be your fault, but it's definitely your problem. Think of 1000 eyes as the Google
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:56.160]   maps of the Internet. I think of it. I like to think of it as a squeegee. I feel like the Internet
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.680]   is this you're looking through a dirty window trying to figure out what's going on.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:05.840]   1000 eyes comes along and squeegees it and you've got a perfect view, a real time map of the Internet
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:12.400]   with visibility into the digital experience from every user to every app or service hosted in any
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.920]   cloud. So, and by the way, every company these days relies on the Internet to deliver services
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:23.440]   to their customer and whatever it is, you've got to trust the Internet. We know, look at Target last
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:30.080]   the yesterday. Target's cash registers stopped working in every Target store.
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:37.120]   Customers abandoned their shopping carts because they couldn't check out. This must have cost Target
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.840]   an untold millions of dollars. And you can imagine I could I could just see them in the network
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.920]   center going, what's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's wrong? What's going on?
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:52.720]   We're losing money. What's going on? I hope they had 1000 eyes. There no Internet, no service.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.480]   You lose revenue. You lose brand reputation. Ultimately you lose customers. That's why companies
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:03.600]   that rely on the Internet rely on 1000 eyes. It lets you know not only when there's an issue on
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:10.640]   the Internet before it impacts business, but also those insights will help you fix the problem.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.640]   You can work with your service provider. You could say, I see you the problem. It's in your
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.880]   network operations center. It's in North Virginia. This is what's going on and you can collaborate
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.120]   and get back to business. If you're deploying SaaS applications, if you're moving workloads
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:29.600]   to the cloud, the Internet is now your home. And if there's a problem, if your employees can't
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.600]   run their cash registers or access sales force or service now or Office 365 or Zoomers like
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.560]   you can't help customers. You can't service requests. You can't collaborate. You become
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:45.760]   unproductive. You money starts flying out the window. That's why I teach teams. Anybody responsible
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:51.840]   loves 1000 eyes. Now you can see what's going on. You can fix issues fast. You can keep businesses
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.720]   running smoothly. And I just love it because so often when you hear about these outages,
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.960]   you get these kind of namby-pamby. Well, something went wrong. And it's fixed now,
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:08.720]   but we don't know what happened. 1000eyes.com/twit, you need to know. I think the Internet
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:11.920]   worked better for you. By the way, they have a great booklet. This is a good one to share
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:16.960]   with the boss. Five cloud migration challenges. You shouldn't ignore it. And then you can bring
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.640]   it up in the cut. Yeah, the good company needs stuff, good information, right? These 1000 eyes
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:26.320]   guys, we kind of need them. 1000eyes.com/twit. This will help you get the conversation started
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:32.080]   with the boss because you do need 1000eyes. 1000eyes.com/twit. They really should call it a million
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:37.520]   eyes because it's a lot more than 1000 eyes. They've got sensors everywhere. Everywhere. From
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:43.040]   every cloud provider down to the coffee, the Wi-Fi in the coffee shop, they know what's going on.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:48.800]   1000eyes, make the Internet work for your business. Thank you, 1000eyes for your support.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:57.040]   We're big fans. Did I get it all? I should have asked you before we moved on. And we get all the
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.840]   E3 news out of the way. Shane, was there a big story that I didn't mention that we wanted to
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:06.720]   bring up anything? No, I think organically ended up hitting most of the big stuff. The show was a
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:12.480]   little bit of a downtrend this year. Is there a show you're looking for? Do you go to PAX and all
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:19.920]   that? PAX is my favorite event. Everybody's favorite event. Yes, it is. It's because it's not
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:27.040]   all stodgy and kind of formal. It's not businessy. Corporate. I think, yeah, it's not corporate at
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:33.600]   all, though it's striding in that direction a little bit over the last few years. But I think why most
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.960]   players like to go is because it's a chance for them to mingle with developers in an informal
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:43.280]   setting. You can sit there and you can play in a tabletop board game. And next thing you know,
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:49.520]   Tim Shafer from Double Fine says down and says, "Hey, can I play?" It's just a very communal vibe at
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:55.120]   that entire event. Everybody's having a good time. I don't know what it is. Penny Arcade just
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.480]   captured something really magical with that. I've not been out to any of the other events or
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:05.920]   similar, but PAX West is really, if you like games or even just nerd culture at all, it is just an
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.720]   amazing weekend and well worth the money you spend to go there. I have been to all the PAX's,
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:19.120]   including PAX Australia. And I will say my theory as to why it tends to work so well is they did
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:27.200]   something very smartly. And that was the last 19 years. I'm sorry. They created an ecosystem of
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:34.480]   employees and volunteers for their events that are treated extremely well. They call themselves
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:42.720]   enforcers. And it is its own subculture of people that do it every year that feel like it's a privilege
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:51.120]   to do it. And they revel in the moments where they get to be helpful and knowledgeable about
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:57.840]   the event itself. It really is this in-group, this club of people who just want to be the best
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:03.840]   guide around that they possibly can. And I think it permeates the feeling of the entire show. It
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:09.200]   makes it really feel friendly and positive. And they were very smart to do that right at the
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:14.480]   beginning. And it has continued, I think, throughout. I like what you said earlier, Jeff, that really,
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:20.080]   that this is an art form. And now the tools are out for artists, for people really creative,
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.680]   people not geeks, but really, I mean, you still need geeks to write the engines.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:27.520]   But these engines make it, these metalware makes it possible for people who are really creative
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.120]   to use this art form. And that's very exciting.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:39.280]   It's cool, man. You go to the indie megabooth or any of these little corners where independent
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:43.920]   games are thriving in any of these shows. Indie megabooth is at PAX. All the PAX is Indie Mega
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:54.960]   Booth was at E3 this year. You see young people that are so cool. I got a moment at GDC at the
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.080]   indie megabooth where I was standing in the indie megabooth and I looked around and I went,
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:04.080]   I'm the oldest person here. And all of these kids are so cool.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:11.520]   It's like these kids are so cool. They grew up and they never knew a time when video games
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:16.640]   weren't cool. It is just completely natural to express themselves in the context of interactive
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:22.640]   entertainment. And so they're using this medium to tell stories and express themselves in a way
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:28.480]   that is completely accepted by their peers. And it's really exciting and it's a vibrant subculture
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.080]   and they're all going to grow up and be part of larger companies because they'll make more money.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:37.520]   But they have this experience of creating games that are personal and thinking outside the box
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.720]   and doing stuff interactively that's different and more exciting.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:48.320]   There was a great little game called the Grim Fandango and Tim Schafro who was the creator at
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:53.840]   LucasArts went on just down the road a piece to create a company called Double Fine. They did a
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:43:00.880]   Kickstarter. They sold a game called Broken Age, Psycho Nots. They became a game company that a lot
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:06.880]   of an indie game company that a lot of people really loved. The weirdest story coming out of E3
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:13.840]   is that Microsoft bought them. And here's Tim Schafro's little video on Twitter explaining
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:18.000]   why they sold. The last 19 years Double Fine Productions has been an independent game developer.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:30.560]   Then Microsoft came to us and said, "What if we gave you a bunch of money?"
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.080]   And I said, "Okay, yeah."
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:47.360]   What a good video. He's so great. He's so great.
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.640]   And that's why people love Double Fine by the way.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:55.760]   Tim's a great guy. I mean, he's just... He's only that in person too. I mean,
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:59.840]   he's... That's not scripted. That's just Tim Schafro. He's just an amazing guy.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:06.800]   With excellent comedy timing. And his games have that same comedic timing as well. And they've
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.160]   kind of found a niche in doing games like that. So hopefully they can continue with Microsoft's
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:20.640]   money. Yeah. So I mentioned the target outage yesterday. Cash registers down for several hours.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.640]   A lot of Twitter traffic about it. Can you imagine a giant retailer like Target
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:32.880]   having a single point of failure somewhere? And there's cash registers to stop working.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:39.040]   They said it's not... It wasn't a... We don't think it was an attack.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:45.520]   Somebody kicked a cable somewhere. We don't know. It must feel better if it were an attack, right?
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:53.840]   And then yesterday, Argentina is having local elections. They have a massive power outage,
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:59.200]   which spreads to Uruguay because they're on the same grid system. They say we don't think it was
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.840]   an attack. It wasn't an election day. We don't think it was an attack. We think there was a
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:09.600]   cascading effect because we lost power from a hydroelectric dam. But we don't think it was an attack.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.960]   And then there's a story in the New York Times. I'm going to tie this all together because there
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:21.200]   was a story in the New York Times on the 15th, just a couple of days ago, that really scared me.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:29.760]   U.S. escalates online attacks on Russia's power grid. We are in a situation where there is a new
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:38.000]   Cold War going on. And it's going on with cyber attacks, with hackers. We know that the Russians
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.600]   have been for years putting malware on our power stations, on our power grid. They've been doing
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:49.760]   it for a long time. Public warnings from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI that
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:55.440]   Russia had inserted malware that could sabotage American power plants, oil and gas pipelines or
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:01.120]   water supplies. So what's the response? Well, you know, the natural response would be, let's see how
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:08.560]   we can secure these now, or maybe a natural or maybe not. Or maybe the natural response would be
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.800]   what the nations the world did after World War one, they got together and said, you know, we need
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:18.320]   some treaties so that mustard gas and other poison gases will never be used again. Maybe you
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:26.080]   could do that. Or I know what we'll do. Let's escalate the matter. Let's put our own malware in the
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:34.800]   Russian grid. So get ready because I think that I don't know about Target. And I'm sure I don't
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:40.560]   know about Argentina. But I do know that a couple of years ago, Ukraine was down for a
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:47.840]   consider amount of time in an attack perpetrated from the Russian Federation. Using tools by groups
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:56.240]   like Fancy Bear, hacking tools. And I think that we are heading into what could be a real imagine,
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:03.120]   you know, PG&E for those of us in California, did you get Jeff the email from PG&E saying we
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:08.160]   might turn your power off? Oh, yeah. That was like a flashback to however many years ago when we
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:14.720]   would have brownouts. Yeah. But this one, they said for as long as 48 hours. Yeah. This is because
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:20.000]   of the fire, high fire danger. And of course, I think it's punitive because PG&E is getting sued
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.320]   by everybody for the big fires that you had down your way. And we had up our way because it was
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:29.040]   their power lines poorly maintained that people think caused those fires. So PG&E said, well,
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:33.360]   if that's how you feel, we'll just turn off your power for a couple of days. It was weird that
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:39.680]   they ended the email with enjoy the looting. That was the giveaway, wasn't it? Go buy a gun.
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:48.000]   So what if there's a cyber war and the Russians kick our power out for not a day or two or a week?
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.280]   Imagine what would happen in the nation's cities if the power were out for seven days or a week or
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:59.600]   a month? Well, four days in our key, I think that's all it take. Four days. We only have a food
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:05.200]   supply for three days. Once everyone's cell phones die is anarchy. That's it. Forget about
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:13.360]   the idea. I can't call my mom. I mean, I don't I we're in a cyber war. I mean, it's not,
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:21.040]   it's not coming. It's here. And again, as Shane said, at the risk of getting political, the great,
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:28.240]   I think the worst offense, well, maybe not the worst, but one of the worst offenses of the last
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:40.080]   two plus years is the fact that everyone now, everyone, even Trump himself has seemed to acknowledge
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:47.440]   that we were attacked in a coordinated way. We have a detailed report stepping us through.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:54.000]   Volume one is a very detailed report stepping us through exactly the sophistication level of the
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:04.720]   attack. There were any indictments. Yeah, 32 of them. Yeah. And zero has been done. Zero has been done
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:10.880]   to address it. No. And yes, I think that what you see with, you know, what Trump is calling a
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:17.840]   treason, but also not true. So I don't know how it's not true. And treason. It's treason, but
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:23.760]   also not true. This New York Times report. I think those are the kind of in kind responses that
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:30.480]   a government tends to make without making the public that are trying to retaliate for those kinds of
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:39.520]   things. But the fact that there has been no government action to actually take steps to prevent
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:47.680]   an attack on this country, cyber attack on this country is unbelievable. It's unbelievable that
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:53.600]   let alone election attacking, which clearly is happening. We reports over and over and over again.
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:50:02.000]   But as you're saying, power grids and infrastructure infrastructure. So it's insane. There's a United
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.400]   States cyber command, which was elevated to a equal level as the rest of the armed services,
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:17.760]   led by General Paul M. Nachisonet was given last summer, a leeway to conduct offensive,
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.920]   not defensive offensive online operations without presidential approval.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:30.240]   It basically at their own discretion. It has gotten far more, far, far more aggressive over the past
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:35.680]   years said one senior intelligence official. We are doing things at a scale that we never
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:42.960]   contemplated a few years ago. But no one will say what we're doing. Officials at the National
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:49.680]   Security Council declined to comment. They said they have no national security concerns about the
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:52.560]   details of the times reporting about the targeting of the Russian grid.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:51:03.120]   I think this is about to get interesting. I think defense is smarter than offense in cases like this.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:09.120]   It's also very short-sighted to assume that if you just leave it alone, that it's going to continue
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:14.880]   to benefit you. Speaking about election interference and things like that, I think it's pretty
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:21.120]   stupid to just assume that whatever happened in 2016 to your benefit is going to benefit you
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:28.320]   in 2020 as well. You also crack open the idea of are our political candidates going to start
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:32.480]   campaigning for Russia? Are they going to start trying to appeal to Russia? So they're Russia helps
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:39.600]   out. I mean, Russia, I'm good for you. Seriously. I mean, he kind of did that on camera publicly.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:43.120]   So is that where we're going to be? Or do we need to dedicate more time to actually defending
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:48.640]   ourselves? I mean, it's crazy. It does seem like you could make an effort. Maybe they are to lock
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:54.720]   this stuff down and build a better defense. There's no public effort that way. And Congress's
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:00.800]   the Senate has completely stymied any attempt to do that. And I'm not just talking about election
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:06.800]   meddling. But I really don't even fear that anymore. I compared to an attack on our infrastructure
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:13.920]   by faceless hackers. And when all it takes is just to look what happened to target to
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:20.640]   Yeah, this is the this is the companion article after I read the Times article. I read this companion
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:31.440]   article in ours, Technica, about Russian incursions into our grid and more hackers are behind dangerous
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:38.080]   oil and gas intrusions all over the US power grids. The very good Dan Gooden at ours, Technica,
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:46.160]   saying there's something called tricon X, the tricon X malware security firms are seeing this
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:57.200]   at work all over the United States. Fire I reported that the malware known as Triton or
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:03.440]   Trisis was using an attack on another industrial facility in April. They're seeing it all over
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:11.600]   our grid. So it's happening. Yeah, maybe we are in the middle of it. I just worry about the day
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:18.400]   the power goes out. And then what happens? Yeah, it's scary stuff. I had your power behind that too,
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:25.040]   though, because whoever does it can say I did this on behalf of this. And if you want us to fix it,
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:30.480]   then you guys need to do this. I mean, it's never just a simple thing of all the power is out for
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:35.200]   three hours. And it's just this anonymous attack. Like they're they can assign those attacks to
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:40.960]   whatever they want to try to get what they want. Right. So well, the good news is the United States
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:47.040]   has gotten very good at securing data and protecting information. Well, no, wait a minute. Sorry, I'm wrong.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:58.160]   So apparently there were security cameras scanning license plates and drivers as they entered
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:05.040]   the United States. I think it was from Canada. And the tens of thousands of images of travelers
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:13.040]   and license plates stole have been stolen from CPB. Well, it turned out that a federal subcontractor
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:19.200]   transferred copies of the images to his network, which the agency says was done with that. It's
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.320]   knowledge. Okay. And in violation of his contract, maybe you'd want to lock those down. Then the
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:31.440]   subcontractors network was hacked. No more the US government says no more than 100,000 people had
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:36.720]   their information compromised by the attack. That is small beans compared to some other ones.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:43.920]   OPM was 22 million. So guys, this is no. And CPB says, say that until you're the one who has your
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:50.560]   identity stolen, that'll change your perspective on everything. Subtract contractor just wanted to
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:55.680]   have him to just peruse at his leisure, I guess, you know, what a mess. He was probably going to
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.880]   sell it to somebody. A subcontractor was Perceptic, a Tennessee based company that makes license plate
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:07.040]   readers and provides a government with other border security services. They were hacked last
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:16.000]   month. Nobody's talking about whether this was them. But we think it probably was.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.160]   It's no big deal. It was just information from one lane of the border crossing.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:30.480]   It's one lane. All right. I'm going to talk. Let's talk about something more fun.
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:39.920]   We're happy. How about this one? The soccer app. So it happens all over the world. La Liga,
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:46.640]   which is the nation, the Spain's top professional soccer league created an app with millions of
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:52.000]   downloads. And the problem was the soccer league was worried because there were a lot of bars,
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.680]   pirating games. So they decided to use the app to turn on the microphone on the phone to listen in
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.720]   to see if they could catch any bars pirating the game without licenses.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.360]   They might want to head over to Reddit.
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.760]   If they really.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:15.760]   Watching pirate streams of sports, I'm just saying better way to do that. Check out Reddit.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:25.680]   So you have to marry the audio information of the game with the GPS location. That's right.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:31.600]   Not being at a private residence. Right? Because everybody that has this app is watching the soccer
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:38.160]   game. Yeah. Right. Because you're a fan. You have the app. So the app would use GPS to detect
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.600]   if it was in a bar. The phone was in a bar. And then it would turn on the phone's microphone.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:51.280]   And they would use technology kind of like Shazam to identify the audio. And then they would say,
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:57.360]   well, does this bar have a license? They got caught. They paid a quarter of a million euro fine for it.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:02.240]   My thing here is why, I mean, okay, what were they going to do? They found someone that was
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:06.320]   streaming it illegally. Just be like, yeah, we heard through an app that you're doing this or like,
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:13.200]   just yeah. Were they clearly going to get caught at some point in the terms of service.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:18.560]   If you accept the specific and optional box enabled for this purpose, you can send to the
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:23.440]   access and use of your mobile devices microphone. Of course, nobody reads this and geo positioning
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:27.280]   functions so that La Liga knows from which locations football is being streamed and thus
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:35.200]   detect and it's in the TOS. Nobody reads TOS. They can put whatever they want in there.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.240]   It's like that old Simpsons episode. Like I can't remember the last time I read it terms of service,
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:46.400]   probably like 1998 or something. Oh my God. That is hilarious. Just below the paragraph where
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:52.000]   they have the rights to your blood. Yeah. Right in your first board. Yeah. Telegram D.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.520]   Dost. They think it was because Telegram is being used in Hong Kong on the streets of Hong Kong,
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:04.720]   where protesters are protesting a new extradition treaty with China. We'll put Hong Kong more
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:10.960]   directly under the control of mainland China. So all of a sudden, Telegram stopped working.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:21.840]   It's really, I mean, nation states now have huge power in the cyber world and they use it at will,
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:30.240]   basically, in it with impunity. Yeah. And I think honestly, that soccer story probably
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:36.800]   hasn't been read by a lot of people in America, but I would guess stories like that
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:45.200]   are much more likely to drive home the point than the sort of abstract idea of your phone has a
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:50.960]   mic. These things that we can all relate to, I wasn't a bar and we were watching a game. I,
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:55.920]   you know, it feels like those kinds of stories maybe actually turned on my microphone.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:01.440]   They were listening in on what I was doing. I'm waiting for the day because everyone that I know
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:05.360]   in my circle has been suspicious that their phone has been spying on them. This isn't new,
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:08.880]   like everyone's like, Oh, how does Instagram know I was talking about this? And then it's
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:12.320]   showing me ads for this. I literally didn't type it anywhere. They just know. And like,
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:17.840]   I have my personal suspicions, but, you know, no proof they do that. I thought that was proven
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:23.840]   already that my daughter told me her friend said baby ducks, baby ducks, baby ducks, a bunch of
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:27.360]   time into her phone. And all of a sudden she got ads for baby ducks in her Instagram.
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:36.640]   I threw past as a bowling lane bowling alley that's like a mile from us and we had never gone. And
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:40.880]   one night we were driving by it and I said to my wife, I'm like, why have we never gone to the
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:45.760]   Bolero? And she's like, I don't know. And then we get home. I come in my part. The first ad on
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:54.000]   Facebook is for Bolero. Bolero. Yeah. So I mean, I percent is happening. I had a similar
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.080]   experience where I sit with my friend like, Oh, my friend was a heavy or heard of rumble boxing.
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:02.240]   You should go. And that was the only time I'd ever heard of it or looked up, looked it up or what
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:07.040]   I didn't even look it up. I just heard of it. And it yeah, Instagram was showing me ads for it.
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:12.880]   And here's the thing. I tweeted about it and I got shouted down by every person on Twitter about
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:17.920]   how dumb I was for thinking that my phone could be used to listen on my conversation. And like,
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:22.720]   I've been like, therefore half convinced and half not convinced. They're saying the point of the
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.800]   people saying that that's not possible is that you're ignoring the fact that Facebook and Instagram
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:31.440]   have so much information on you. So in your case, Shane, it might have been the GPS of your phone
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:35.520]   has been noted to like pass by the Bolero or something. And then they're surfacing it up to you.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.920]   So why is that? It's also you're literally five minutes. It's a coincidence.
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:46.640]   It's also just an awesome human beings are pattern recognition machines. We are built for that.
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:51.120]   Very good at recognizing those. You would not have noticed the Bolero ad if you hadn't seen
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:57.120]   Bolero. So we convince ourselves of these things. I'm not saying it's not happening,
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:03.680]   but I'm saying the human brain is built to create a narrative out of data points that are disparate.
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:07.440]   That's absolutely true. Yeah. There are tons of you.
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:08.800]   Look at Mars. Exactly.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:12.800]   They're on their phone and yelled Nike, Nike, Nike, and then go to their
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:16.720]   to Facebook and there's a bunch of Nike ads. I mean, you can go look at it yourself. I'm just
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:20.400]   sharing my anecdotal evidence and what I've seen other people do online.
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:23.600]   I'm doing the baby duck experiment. As soon as we get done with the show,
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:24.800]   I'm baby duck.
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:27.360]   Sounds like we've picked something obscure.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:31.920]   We've said it enough during this podcast to be like all of us are getting ads on baby
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:32.000]   ducks.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.960]   That's pretty. We just want to go bowling.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.400]   Bowling with ducks. All right.
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:44.400]   I do hope that one day they find out though that this is indeed happening. Like someone cracks it
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:47.680]   and they find definitive evidence. But for now, we have nothing to go on.
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:50.480]   Well, I think I was not true. I don't want it to be true.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:53.840]   Can't you see the traffic that's being, I mean, I'm sure somebody's sitting there with
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:57.120]   Wireshark looking at maybe you wouldn't notice. I don't know.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.560]   I don't know.
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.040]   I talk about so many things all day long that don't show up as ads.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:09.440]   There's no way Amazon, Google, Facebook could be listening to every single bit of data coming
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:12.240]   out of. I mean, that would be crazy. No, Google is.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:16.000]   And there Google is classifying it based on all these different categories and they're
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.120]   matching it up with the companies that are advertising with them. It's not that
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.160]   complicated. If they ever got caught doing that, they'd be out of business, don't you think?
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:23.440]   I don't know.
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:23.920]   No.
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:28.080]   I think people are acceptable of a certain amount of intrusion in their lives. I think
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.400]   millennials, there are some millennials that want that to happen. They're not adverse to it.
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:39.440]   They're like, I want an ad in my feed for something that I suddenly became interested in.
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.240]   Well, why wouldn't you?
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:40.480]   Cool.
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:45.200]   I mean, honestly, a Valero ad is a nice thing, right? Because you drove by it.
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.800]   Now, we were thinking about going there.
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:48.320]   I mean, you remember it.
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:51.040]   I mean, when you look at it, they're like, that's the way it's supposed to work.
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:51.920]   Why do you hate it?
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:54.080]   Why do you want to ask for things you don't like?
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.640]   But a lot of people who are living on Instagram and Facebook, they don't want privacy.
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:05.200]   All day, they're violating their own privacy by taking 30 selfies of themselves and posting them.
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:12.000]   So I just think it's a difference of outlook and perspective from maybe our generation to the
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:12.800]   next generation.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:13.360]   That brings me to it.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.040]   I was concerned about privacy as we are.
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:18.080]   That brings me to global coin, which is Facebook's currency.
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:20.560]   I think Zuckbox is a better name, but OK.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.720]   That's what we came up with last week.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.000]   That's pretty good.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:24.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:26.560]   That's what they're going to be called.
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:27.760]   No, no, baby ducks.
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:28.800]   Baby ducks bucks.
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:30.000]   Baby Zuck bucks bucks.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.960]   Facebook might reveal it as early as next week, although they don't expect it would be
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.240]   happening till 2020.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:40.640]   According to Wall Street Journal, they've got deals with Visa, MasterCard, PayPal,
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:47.520]   that they will, in fact, you will be able to pay for Ubers with Zuckbox.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.920]   But here's the thing that's a little scary.
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:58.240]   A number of crypto companies, this is from a story on CoinDesk, have turned Facebook down.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:02.560]   The issue, it says, "Based on conversations with seven knowledgeable sources,
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:07.040]   CoinDesk confirmed Facebook's plan is to get this, get ready,
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:12.000]   connect users' financial information to their personal Facebook profiles."
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.360]   Of course.
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:15.360]   What could possibly go on?
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:15.600]   They want to be WeChat, right?
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:17.440]   They want to be WeChat.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:18.000]   Yes.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.040]   They want to be essential to life.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:26.480]   They want to be part of every transaction you make every moment of your life.
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:29.600]   And you know, I dumped Facebook and Instagram in August.
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.120]   I don't miss it at all.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:35.600]   But if suddenly Zuckbox or the coin of the realm,
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.720]   I might have to go back, right?
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.840]   Well, you will have to do that.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:41.840]   We don't accept anything but Zuckbox here, sir.
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:42.720]   I'm sorry.
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:45.040]   Whereas you're Zuckbox.
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:46.880]   No, I don't take those greenbacks.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:47.760]   What are those for?
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.840]   All right.
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:51.520]   Let's take a good day.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:52.240]   Go ahead, Sherlin.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:56.240]   I have several issues with this whole thing.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:00.400]   This is your generation, Sherlin.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.000]   This is your future.
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:05.600]   I didn't want to say this, but Shane, when you were going on about millennials,
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:06.800]   I felt kind of subtweeted.
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:07.440]   But OK.
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:11.440]   Are you a millennial?
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:14.320]   Is that the most millennial sentence ever said also?
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:15.840]   A little bit.
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:17.120]   You felt subtweeted?
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:17.920]   I was subtweeted.
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:20.400]   I fit the definition.
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:23.440]   I mean, I was born within the age range, I think, of a millennial.
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.200]   If you're under 35, you're technically a millennial.
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.800]   Yeah, I am under 35.
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:29.520]   So like, I guess, technically, I'm on the older end of that spectrum.
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:32.320]   But anyway, um, yeah,
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:36.880]   I, you know, I have seen the convenience of Alipay or WeChat,
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:40.320]   you know, paying by WeChat like in places you go to because I people.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.320]   Did Singapore use something like that?
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:43.200]   Do they have a system?
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:43.920]   Yeah, we do.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:49.680]   We do use, I think, the WeChat payment system in a lot of the restaurants,
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:52.320]   but it's being adopted here in the US as well.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.880]   So it's not like it's an Asia only thing.
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:06:01.120]   It's growing just because of the sheer like spread starting from China.
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:04.960]   And then like just how these tourists have gone to all these other countries
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.560]   and spending huge amounts.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:07.440]   It's convenient.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:11.840]   I'm, I, I like it if somebody uses Venmo because it makes it much easier for me to pay them, right?
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:15.760]   My thing with Facebook's purported efforts here though,
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:17.840]   is that I think it's a little late in the game.
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:23.680]   I think that you've already got like things like Apple Pay and Google Pay
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:27.520]   already like taking a bit more of the market share in this specific industry.
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:30.960]   I don't know that coming up with a whole cryptocurrency is going to make it
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:35.680]   all that much more attractive to the millennial audience.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:38.720]   Just because like, yeah, it may be more secure.
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:44.880]   Here's the difference because Apple Pay and Google Pay are American dollars.
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:48.240]   Facebook's own currency, Facebook would have control of it.
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:52.480]   So they could say, hey, congratulations because you've been an active Facebook user.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.840]   We're giving you a hundred zuck bucks.
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:54.960]   Okay.
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:57.760]   Yeah, that would be, I think, dangerous.
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:06:58.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:01.200]   But that also undermines the value of the currency.
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:01.520]   Yeah.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:03.360]   Of course, that's the point.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:09.360]   How would it, how would it get so popular that it would replace de facto like the currency of the
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:12.080]   nation or, you know, how would it get successful enough?
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:12.480]   I don't know.
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:16.560]   I just have so many questions and like issues with the whole situation here.
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:17.440]   You're, we'll find out.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.160]   It's a great.
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:22.000]   It's a grand experiment every week here on Twitch.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:22.880]   Let's take a little break.
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:23.760]   We'll wrap this up.
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:26.400]   But first I want to show you the video we made.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:30.960]   I think we spent some real time crafting this highlight reel of all the things you
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:33.920]   might have missed if you missed anything this week on Twitch.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.760]   Previously on Twitch.
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:41.360]   It sounds like these new iOS 13 features will allow me to, you know, check my iPad and my
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:41.840]   location.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.520]   I unfortunately have broken my ankles.
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:45.120]   So I've been struggling to check the location.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:48.640]   Did you break your ankle in San Jose?
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:49.520]   Yes, I did.
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:50.400]   I fell off a scooter.
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:53.200]   10 out of 10 do not recommend folding off scooters.
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:56.000]   Tech News Weekly.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:01.120]   The maker media, the company behind Make Magazine and Make-R-Faire is closing down.
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:05.440]   I think the most important impact the maker movement has had is coming in through the
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:09.440]   side door in the schools and really changing the nature of learning in school.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.840]   Security now.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:20.160]   The FBI has reminded us not to place trust in a website just because it's secure.
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:23.840]   Triangulation. I talked to Julian Guthrie.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.400]   She is the author of Alpha Girls.
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:32.640]   There are 6% of venture capitalists who are succeeding, who are women.
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:37.840]   So I wanted to know who they are, what is it like being the only woman at the table?
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:39.680]   This week in Google.
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:45.520]   This morning I woke up to see images of a Pixel 4 phone.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:46.800]   It's the usual leaks we get.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:49.440]   And Google responded, the May by Google Twitter feed.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:51.200]   Since there seems to be some interest, here you go.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:56.160]   They said actual pictures of the back of the Pixel 4, which I mean, that's the way to handle it.
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:58.640]   Twitter. Tech. Just like you like it.
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:00.640]   Fresh and hot.
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:02.240]   What?
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:04.480]   How do I like it? Don't leave me hanging.
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:06.960]   Are you?
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:09.760]   That's the same guy who used to voice the tech TV promo back.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:11.200]   Jim Cutler, you voice.
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:11.360]   Yeah.
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:13.200]   You, Shane, have a good ear.
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:17.920]   That's the amazing Jim Cutler who we never let go.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:22.000]   I told him that he'd get a check from tech TV.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.680]   So don't tell him.
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:26.160]   That it went away.
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:26.560]   Yes.
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.600]   Just leave it alone.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:32.240]   I think he's sending the invoices to tech TV.
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:35.120]   And I'm sure he'll get paid someday.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:40.000]   Jim does it for us for free because he's such a great guy.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:40.720]   And yeah, we love him.
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:41.200]   The great voice.
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:43.520]   He is the voice of ESPN at many radios.
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:44.160]   I mean, he does.
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:47.520]   He's like the king of voiceover guys.
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:49.280]   So we're very lucky to have him.
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:51.840]   Our show today brought to you by the fresh air in the studio.
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:53.040]   Have you noticed?
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:53.680]   Molecule.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.840]   We're in pollen season in Petaloma.
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:58.080]   I know because when I got up this morning,
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:01.920]   there was yellow dust around the cat's bowls because they,
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:05.760]   what they do is they go out and they run around in the weeds or whatever.
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.040]   And they collect all this pollen.
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:09.760]   They bring it into the house a layer thick.
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:13.280]   This is why we got the molecules some years ago.
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:16.960]   This is a air purifier that works better than anything ever.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:19.840]   It's actually modern technologies, not a HEPA filter.
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:21.840]   That technology has been around since World War II.
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:28.400]   And it hasn't really been improved since HEPA's trapped particles of a certain size.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:31.360]   And they store them, but Molecule does so much better.
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:35.440]   It uses Pico technology, photo, electrochemical oxidation.
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:39.680]   It not only captures, but it eliminates particles,
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.720]   even particles a thousand times smaller than a HEPA filter.
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:49.920]   Mold, allergens, bacteria, even viruses, even airborne chemicals,
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.520]   volatile organic compounds from like formaldehyde and paint fumes.
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.120]   Catchism and destroys them doesn't even trap and just destroys them.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.960]   We use it and we love it.
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:10:59.680]   I like it so much.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:03.360]   We got one for our son for his room because he was starting to sneeze and get allergies
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:04.640]   and headaches in the morning.
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.800]   Lisa was getting splitting headaches in the morning and molecules completely eliminated them.
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:10.640]   Now we have one in the studio too.
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.960]   Molecule's technology works for me,
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:15.280]   but it's also verified by science.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:21.760]   They actually tested this at the University of Southern Florida's Center for Biological
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:26.240]   Defense and the University of Minnesota's Particle Calibration Laboratory.
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:28.480]   This is not some made up technology.
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.440]   This is the real deal.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:34.160]   It's been tested extensively and verified by these big institutions.
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:36.000]   It is a miracle.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.400]   If you've been looking for an air purifier that can deal with anything in the air
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:42.000]   and get rid of it, you will love it.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.400]   The molecule is like the apple of air purifiers too.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:46.080]   It's got a beautiful aluminum shell.
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:49.920]   You can get a filter replacement subscription service.
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:52.880]   I've attached my molecule to an app on the phone.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:54.480]   It uses Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:57.520]   Not only can I control the molecule from my phone,
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:00.880]   but I can also check the status of the filters and it'll even order new filters for me.
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.000]   They arrive and I put them in.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.280]   It's very easy to change the filters, but I tell you, when those filters come out,
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:08.880]   you know they've been doing their job.
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:10.800]   It's incredible.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:13.600]   Molecule, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:19.600]   Make the air you breathe as fresh and clean as you're out in the forest.
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:20.800]   It's fantastic.

[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.280]   We thank them for supporting TWIT.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.920]   We thank you for using that order code, because that tells them you heard it here.
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:57.440]   Are you sad that Huawei is delaying its foldable phone until September, Shirlan?
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:12:59.680]   Kind of.
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:00.880]   I was looking forward to it.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:10.960]   Yeah. I'm kind of glad to get a bit more time to try to get them to give me a preview of the phone.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:11.520]   Yes.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:12.560]   I have no idea.
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:15.120]   It was September to be like, "Hey, let me take a look at your phone, guys."
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:16.480]   Did you play with the Galaxy Fold?
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:17.520]   Yes.
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:24.800]   So I was lucky enough to have both the Galaxy Fold and Lenovo's foldable laptop,
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:27.040]   foldable laptop with a foldable screen.
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.840]   My two hands at the same time I did a foldable dance with both of them was pretty cool.
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:33.520]   That was a shady gesture.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:37.760]   At least you weren't subtrated.
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:39.520]   No, I'm screaming.
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:45.120]   I did get to play with the Galaxy Fold briefly.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:46.080]   How did your...
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:47.680]   How did Engadget's unit survive?
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:48.160]   Did you...
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:48.160]   Did you...
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:48.720]   I...
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:54.000]   Surprised it was okay, plus even more surprising was the fact that I actually handed it off to our
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:58.640]   Senior Mobile editor, Chris Velasco, to review and it survived.
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:13:59.920]   He's the phone destroyer.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:02.160]   Our...
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:03.120]   I had not one scratch.
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:03.760]   Our fold...
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:07.200]   Granted, when I handed it to him, I was like, "You had to be careful with this,
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:08.720]   like with more than your own life.
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:10.400]   Like, I will kill you before this fall."
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:13.280]   He was smart enough not to peel off the screen protector.
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:13.920]   Yes.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.960]   Well, his Samsung was very careful to give us instructions to be like,
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:22.080]   "You do not peel it off and do not be careless with it."
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:26.240]   So I don't know why other people might have done that.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:31.040]   I'm not saying that you shouldn't peel off the screen protector of your phone.
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:32.640]   No, I do.
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.560]   You are on the S10 and that's probably why people like Marquez Brownlee thought,
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:39.360]   "Oh, it's okay to do that because the S10 comes with the screen protector.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:41.200]   I don't like screen protectors and I peeled it off."
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:45.440]   But in this case, it was more than just a screen protector.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:50.000]   With a new first gen product like that, yeah, you kind of always had to be careful.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.640]   I was excited for Huawei still because it just, I thought the whole thing looked so much more
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:15:01.600]   promising. I thought that the fold outwards set up was more appealing to me,
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:03.520]   just because it had a bigger screen on the outside.
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:07.040]   The Galaxy phone had a weird secondary screen on the outside.
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:09.040]   That was smaller. It just didn't feel very useful.
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:12.720]   So now it's kind of cool. It's like a trifle.
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:15.600]   So do we know when the Galaxy is going to come out or are they just,
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:18.320]   I mean, it sounds like they should never put it out?
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:24.160]   They don't know. Honestly, this might be another debacle on the scale of the Note 7.
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:30.720]   Yeah, I don't know. I know they've delayed it once and delayed it twice now,
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:35.600]   and I think AT&T's cancel pre-orders. There's just a lot that signifies that this phone
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:37.440]   might not come out this year at all. I don't think so.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:40.960]   Do you think Huawei's delay has to do with their troubles with the US government,
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:43.600]   or is there actually an issue with the phone that they're?
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:49.920]   From the reports that I read made it seem like they were learning a lesson from Samsung.
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:52.320]   No, no idea what that really means.
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:55.920]   They told CNBC, "We don't want to launch a product to destroy our reputation."
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:00.640]   Okay, it seems like a good idea.
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:01.520]   Throw a little lace for that.
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:07.600]   That kind of shows you the amount of confidence they have in their product.
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:15.200]   They were very much more open to letting reporters and media play with the phone that they had at
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:20.640]   @mwc compared to Samsung, where the phone was still encased inside a glass display,
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:24.400]   whereas Samsung straight up had a working version. You're like, "Yeah, here you go, play with it."
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:28.640]   So I think that Huawei, I'm sorry, I said, did I say Huawei anyway?
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:30.400]   Yeah, so Huawei's product fell a lot more.
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:32.960]   Huawei let you play with the phone. Samsung did not.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.400]   Did not @mwc.
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:43.440]   Flip it around. Okay. So I just think that there might be some issues under the surface here,
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:47.520]   but that it is smart for Huawei to kind of take a breather and be like,
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:50.800]   "Yeah, we are not competing against anyone right now, so let's take some time."
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:51.520]   Yeah, what's the rush?
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:52.080]   Right.
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:52.640]   Yeah.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:52.880]   Yeah.
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:55.920]   So I'd rather see a better product and wait for a little bit more.
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:00.240]   See, that's why we have Sherlin on our show. She's great.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:04.480]   Sherlin Lowe, she is the reviews editor and gadget and just a,
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:08.640]   honestly, a jewel in the Engagic Crown. It's great to have you on.
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:09.120]   It's a lot more.
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:09.520]   Thank you.
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:10.640]   Thank you for having me.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:10.960]   Love it.
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:16.640]   Jeff Kanata, my old friend, always great to have you on. I cannot wait to see the dungeon run.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:18.880]   That looks like a really awesome show.
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:21.840]   Thank you very much. Yeah, I hope you check it out. I'm really proud of it.
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:26.960]   It's going to be a lot of fun on caffeine, YouTube, or check your favorite podcast application and
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:32.160]   download. You can watch or listen, your choice. Yeah, more fun to watch though, you think?
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:35.200]   Yeah, there's a lot of really cool visual elements to the show for sure.
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:35.600]   Okay.
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:36.480]   Yeah, it does look cool.
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:42.080]   And it's really nice to reconnect with Shane Satterfield, long time friend from Tech TV.
