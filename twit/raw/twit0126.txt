[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I wasn't saying they weren't flavorful.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   >> No, they are the best.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   >> Because they're the fattiest.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   >> Well, maybe.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   >> I mean, thinks they're not good for you.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Hello?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   >> Well, you know the weird thing about cashews and, you know,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   in Brazil, they grow cashews.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   >> Right.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   >> Cashews are fruit.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   >> Yeah, it's a fruit.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And it's a big -- it's a weird kind of a nut because it's --
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   the seed is outside of the fruit.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It actually hangs from the bottom of the fruit itself.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's a weird looking thing.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And it's a mutated apple.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   >> And it actually does look like that.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And the juice of the cashew, which is called the cashew,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   which is also drunk mixed with a bunch of --
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   >> Casagia.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   >> I know stuff.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Is the -- is the juice from one of the fruits,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   if it gets on you, it literally turns your skin black.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   >> Oh, great.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   >> And you can't wash it.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It creates permanent stains on anything made out of protein.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> Really?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> So if you get some on your shirt --
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   >> Permanent?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   >> -- with a cotton --
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   >> So I mean on your skin eventually will slough it off when you get used to.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> Yeah, no, it's like a temporary tattoo.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You know, it comes off eventually.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   >> Ooh.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> Hey.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   >> That's a good idea.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   >> Cashew tattoo.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   That could be a business, Roger Chang.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   >> Yes.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   >> It has nasty, though.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's like anything it gets on it, it stains it permanently.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   >> Who needs Henna?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We've got cashew.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   >> Cashew tattoo.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm thinking a franchise nationwide, Roger, you and me?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> Sure.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   >> Will be the cashew tattoo twins.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> I visited -- I was in Brazil and I visited something like a 10-acre cashew grove.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   That was one tree.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> What?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> It's a weird tree.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   The way it propagates is it gets really big and then the branches -- you get so heavy,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   they fall into the ground and they reroute.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   >> Wow.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> And so the whole thing just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   >> But it's not that all.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's still attached.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Yeah, they are, actually.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   >> Wow.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   >> So if you go into the forest, you can keep going to get to the mother tree in the middle,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   which is huge.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's kind of weird.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   >> Can you chop off the mother tree and have the other parts still live?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   >> Yeah, because they're all rooted.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   >> Wow.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Nature is mysterious in her many ways.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   This is our Christmas Eve episode.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And we just did a little in a tivity story for you.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> The mother root.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.400]   >> Hey, Leo, just real quick.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   I talked about Brazil.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.120]   I actually called Brazil yesterday on Skype and not on purpose, by the way.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.760]   But I was trying to call my buddy and I call up and I got -- for some reason I forgot to
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   put the country code in.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.160]   I guess I put the Brazilian country code in.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.320]   And I call up and I hear "alo" and I was like, "I don't think you're my friend."
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.520]   And I don't think she speaks English either.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   And she kept on saying "alo."
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   >> You apparently done.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   So I'll go ahead.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   >> No, what's that?
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.440]   That was a cheap shot.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   She's speaking English.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   Go ahead.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   >> I don't even know what to say to that.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.600]   She's going to say "alo" to me.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.000]   So I tried to say "alo."
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.240]   I was like, "Is my buddy, blah, blah?"
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.480]   And she says something I didn't understand and I just felt bad and I hung up.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.080]   But something you probably shouldn't do every now and then.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.520]   >> Yeah, the nice thing about Skype, it cost you nothing.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   >> No, it did.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.760]   Because I was Skype out.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   >> You know, I called.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.240]   >> You're calling a landline.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.160]   >> Yeah, it dropped out about, I don't know, about $2 about 30 seconds.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.040]   >> She could have been offering you sex for all you know.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.000]   >> She keeps going to her friends.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.320]   She's got a little podcast down there.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.040]   She's going to her friends saying, "I keep getting this call for 1-193-111-19101.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   What is that?
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.760]   What kind of number is that?"
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.440]   You know, you've seen that Skype caller ID.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.680]   I guess that was a very inside joke.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   >> Yes.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   I got it.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.360]   >> Yeah, I got both your jokes so far.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.680]   >> Two I've made.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.840]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.320]   Fake Steve Jobs, really getting sued?
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.240]   >> I doubt it, by who?
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.240]   >> By Apple.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.240]   >> For what?
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.240]   >> Have you been following this?
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.640]   It's actually, I think it's great.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   I think he's creating.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.120]   >> Because he's impersonating someone as a false identity?
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.360]   >> Well, you know about fake Steve Jobs, right?
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360]   >> Yes.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.080]   >> Yeah, Dan Lyons, he's the former senior editor at Forbes who created the fake Steve
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.320]   Jobs blog at fakesteveduplogspot.com.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.320]   He's written a book.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   He was outed by Brad Stone who's been on Twitter.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.000]   And so everybody knows who he is now, but it's still a great site.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.840]   In fact, I hear Steve Jobs even thinks it's pretty funny.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.960]   But after the think-secret story, so I guess we should, I'll tell you the think-secret
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.080]   story and then he picked up on it and ran with it.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.440]   Think-secret's the Apple Rumor's site.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.040]   Apple's been suing for three years, run by a college kid.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.600]   Finally, they reach a settlement.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.400]   This week, Apple's decided to drop charges.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   There's some sort of settlement.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.120]   Nobody, of course, it's a secret settlement.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.760]   But the one thing that we know is true is that the main thing that Apple wanted, which
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.440]   was that the tipster inside Apple be revealed because think-secret got a few pretty good
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.880]   guesses won't happen.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   So that the tipster's probably his heart's been pounding for three years.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.960]   He's probably gets to continue working at Apple.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.880]   >> You may have tipped it off on an anonymous basis.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.080]   By the way, if anybody out there's a tipster, use anonymous email and back it up with a
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.640]   bunch of anecdotal information that makes it appear to convince us that you were the
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.800]   real deal.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.960]   And we'll take it for what it's worth.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.680]   I don't think you have to reveal your identity.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.880]   >> But then it's hard to validate it, isn't it?
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.880]   Because look what happened to Apple.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.200]   >> I don't know if it's a gossip item.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.680]   What dimmers does it make?
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.680]   >> True.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.680]   It's just a rumor.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.160]   But look what happened to Brian Lamick, his moto.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.880]   Because the Apple stock plummeted.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   >> Oh, yeah, he made that.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   What did he say?
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   >> Wasn't that a gadget?
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   >> I'm sorry, it was.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   It was Ryan Blocketing gadget.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   What am I saying?
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.480]   >> I think he said something about the delay of the iPhone or something like that.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.880]   Apple stock tumbled like a few billions.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   It cost him billions.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880]   >> It came right back.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.880]   >> Hey, hey, stop the presses.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.880]   Hit recovery.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:30.000]   >> Anyway, think-secret, the guy who started it, who was a college kid.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.320]   At the time, I'm not sure if he still is.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   He's very happy.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   According to this-
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.040]   >> Yeah, he got a cash out settlement.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   They bought him off.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.440]   >> Why would they pay him money?
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.440]   They were suing him.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   >> Well, I mean, how much later they pay the lawyers?
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.920]   I mean, to go through the court case and have to pay for the lawyers and all the court
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   and face everything else.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.760]   >> I mean, he did not even counting the bad publicity that they wanted to get him off
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.000]   the air and they wanted to, you know, so they did a calculation.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.560]   I know the cheapest way to do it was to give him some money and tell him to shut down
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.360]   the site and that's, and he, you know, did.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.120]   >> The lawyer who represented him said, "This is a victory for the First Amendment."
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.680]   I don't know if I feel that way about it.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.600]   >> I mean, my First Amendment and maybe the First Amendment of the Constitution of Venezuela,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.320]   which says, "No apple rumor shite shall be allowed to exist."
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   >> Hello.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.880]   >> My understanding is that they're already going to- that there was some ruling made
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.600]   or some law or loophole or something like that that Apple probably would have lost anyway.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   >> Ah.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.200]   >> That's what my understanding was, but, you know, whether or not it was.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.880]   But either way, I think, yeah, it just made more sense for them to drop a few, you know,
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.400]   a few dollars on them and walk away.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.160]   Probably what happened was they said, "Okay, listen, we'll just buy things secret."
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   And then they probably just closed it up.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.640]   >> He's an executive, he actually is a Harvard undergrad next to your ally.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.920]   And he's an executive editor on the staff of the Harvard Crimson.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   So he has not allowed, he's been doing this since he was 13.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.480]   I don't think he has a lot of time anyway.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.080]   They sued him when he was a freshman at Harvard age 19.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.880]   >> Man, well, wow.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.880]   >> Something to think about.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.600]   Now let's get back to the crux of the storyline that you began.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.560]   >> So after that settlement, fake Steve.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.480]   [laughs]
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.600]   Fake Steve, of course, has some things to say about the settlement.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:21.920]   But then he says, he's been meeting with, this is so convoluted because it's now Dan
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.840]   Lyons writing his fake Steve, but he's Dan Lyons saying, "Okay, yeah, I'm not really
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.640]   Steve and Apple has offered me a think secret type settlement.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.080]   I'm weighing an offer from Apple," he says.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.240]   So it's a complicated situation.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.600]   I want to keep everybody in the loop.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.480]   Bottom line is I've received an overture from the mothership with a mention of a think
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.760]   secret type settlement if I'll stop impersonating dear leader on the web.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.800]   So basically they're buying off their problem.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.520]   >> I think it's, but no, the general--
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.520]   >> I think it's bogus.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.240]   >> The general feeling on the net is this is a parody of a parody within a parody within
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.240]   an enigma.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.760]   >> Yeah, no, there's no way that if he's a Forbes writer, I can tell you right now that
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.560]   he cannot take a big bunch of cash from Apple, no matter what the reason.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   >> Right.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.920]   >> And isn't this, I mean, why is this so bad for Apple?
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:15.080]   I mean, if anything, if nothing else, it just kind of solidifies that Steve Jobs is this
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.880]   godlike person and everything else and I almost think it almost helps.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880]   >> Oh, it's good for all, of course.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.560]   >> It shows them to have a little bit of a sense of humor.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.840]   Well, but that's just the beginning.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.120]   So then now, again, I don't know if this, you know, this, this here's the drama.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.280]   So next posting, just got an angry letter from Apple's legal douchebags, a real letterhead,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.760]   legal letter, PDF attached to an email saying if we're going to go forward, then we both
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.600]   need to be dealing a good faith and part of that is keeping negotiations confidential
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.520]   and the post I made causes them to question my sincerity.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.560]   And then another update.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.840]   Now they're really pissed, just got another letter saying in response to my last post about
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.320]   doing things transparently, he wants to remind me while this course of action is mine to
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.880]   take, he feels it's his duty to inform me Apple's lawyers have identified at least three posts
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.680]   in my archive, they deem to be actionable.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.000]   It goes on and on.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.320]   And I think it's a joke.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.520]   I think it's a joke.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.280]   He says, you can't take it.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   You can't take it.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   Where'd he go?
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.280]   Roger.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.280]   >> That's it.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.680]   Oh, so you had a call for Roger?
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.400]   >> Yeah, no, it's my actual phone.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   I'll get it later.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:24.160]   >> Well, for Roger, he says that he went to the EFF, but he says they don't like me either.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.640]   >> Well, that would be, you know, now that's, now that we can either prove or disprove.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.120]   >> I think it's attractive.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.480]   >> I think the whole thing's a hoax.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.400]   >> It's just a fun, it's more human.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.280]   >> You know, I don't understand why he's still doing the blog.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.280]   We know who he is.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.880]   We know it's a bunch of bull, you know.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880]   Why don't you shut it down?
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   I mean, what's the point?
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   It's pointless.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   Do a fake something else.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   Try something new.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.560]   I mean, this is like, this is beating a joke to death.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.320]   I mean, this beating a dead horse.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.160]   I mean, come on.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.840]   >> Well, I'm going to send him a note right now.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.680]   Dan, do your Dan.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.560]   Call us and tell us what's going on.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.200]   We'll see if he has anything to say about it.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.720]   I've wanted to get him on the show for a while.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.160]   You know, he talked about me in one of his posts, Steve Jobs, fake Steve Jobs didn't
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.880]   want, doesn't like me.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.440]   He called me a Leo something less, something less squirt.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.080]   I can't remember the squirt.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.920]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:19.240]   >> All right, hey, hey is offering special news stories for local television stations,
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.800]   many of whom have picked it up.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.640]   The video news release is about music piracy complete with exhortations to buy iTunes gift
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.000]   cards and cell phone ringtones.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.920]   >> Wow, wow, wow.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.040]   >> Video press release has commercials in it.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   >> Well, that's what they do.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.240]   These are not press releases.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   They're news releases.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.200]   >> I know, but how many of those have actual commercials with embedded?
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   I've never seen one.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.080]   You mean it's just like, you want to hear it?
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.200]   >> And while you're at it, get yourself an iTunes account.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.000]   >> And the way this works is they make it look like local news and then the local news
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.360]   stations who are too lazy to actually do real news run these as if their own reporter
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   is doing this story.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.280]   >> We're all, I think everybody out there is familiar with the video news release.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:04.080]   >> All the days are a time for private lit trees, parties and family gatherings.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.760]   >> This is from the R right here.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.380]   >> It's also a time for stepped up law enforcement raids on illegal CD duplicators that are
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.800]   costing the entertainment industry billions of dollars a year.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   >> This is so cheap.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.760]   >> Millions of dollars that are going in organized crime.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.360]   >> Is that an anchor or is that the person that's going on?
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.760]   >> They couldn't even get a sound booth for.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.720]   >> Million dollars worth of counterfeit goods.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   >> This is the RAA.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   >> This is a very busy time of year.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.920]   >> He's, by the way, this guy talking is in front of a big poster of Frank Sinatra.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.320]   I don't know what the subject is.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.880]   >> Are they reading from cue cards?
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.880]   I mean, what's-
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.320]   >> The sad thing is local news channels run this stuff.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.220]   >> I mean, it just shows you the state of news.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.740]   >> What, you mean, to isolate those stations that run this crap and we should excoriate
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.940]   them and embarrass, humiliate them in public because that doesn't even sound like a decent
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.940]   report.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.420]   I mean, the freelancers out there that are getting paid next to nothing do better work
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.420]   than that.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:03.780]   >> It sounds like it's one of those free weekend flyers with all the furniture, store ads and
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.780]   car ads.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.780]   >> It's cheesy.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.580]   I mean, you'd think the recording industry, they got some money.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.360]   They got 222 million from Jammy Thomas.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.760]   Spend some money on products, spend a million on products.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.760]   Here's some quotes from the piece.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.800]   Quote, "Audio quality on pirated CDs is usually atrocious."
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.280]   >> Yeah, I don't, I actually, I can't really.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.160]   >> Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.800]   Make sure the music you buy is legitimate.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.040]   And then she goes on to talk about cool, innovative ways to get your favorite music like iTunes
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.240]   and Christmas-themed ringtones.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.840]   >> Oh, God.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   >> Ringtones are...
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.500]   >> I would love to find a list of the stations that have run this.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:49.300]   Folks, if you've seen this, if you've seen this junk, and usually they say, our reporter,
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:54.820]   Leslie Takanawa has the story, and then they'll go to the fake news story.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.820]   >> That's just dirty.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.820]   >> So awful.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:02.100]   Roger, you've left mainstream media.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.100]   >> Mainstream.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.900]   >> Well, that's more mainstream than anything else.
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:10.860]   ZD, you've said goodbye to DLTV, haven't you?
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.980]   >> Yes, at the end of 2007, I am no longer employed by Ziff Davis.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.980]   >> Where are you going?
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.980]   >> I'm going to work with Patrick and Jim.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   >> What a surprise.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.020]   >> So, porn Robert is left holding the bag.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.020]   >> Way shocker.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.500]   >> How long before...
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.820]   >> What's Robert coming over?
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:36.980]   >> Robert's job at Ziff Davis is...
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.980]   >> Yeah, it's a real job.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.180]   >> Yeah, his real job is actually to do HDTV reviews.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.060]   >> So, is he going to keep doing DLTV, or are they going to shutter it?
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.060]   What are they going to do?
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:51.740]   >> I think they will continue DLTV, however they have not told me explicitly of what the
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:57.500]   direction and the style that they intend to go forward with after starting after CES.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.780]   >> Are you doing your own show, Roger?
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:05.740]   >> Hopefully one day, but for now I'll be working on the tech selling system.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.740]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.180]   >> So, I will be producing or at least co-producing those.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:19.660]   And hopefully, as the months turn into years, I might be able to get something that I'd
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:25.420]   be wanting to do for a while, which would be like my own sci-fi kind of magazine oriented
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.420]   show.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.420]   >> Ooh, I like that.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.420]   >> You want to do sci-fi?
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.420]   >> Yeah, that would be totally cool.
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.300]   >> Chang in space.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:38.820]   >> Well, I actually wanted to do it the way Leonard Nimoy used to do in search of.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.820]   >> Remember?
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.820]   >> What will you be searching for?
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.260]   >> That's a funny thing.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.020]   >> He's searching for a career, apparently.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.020]   >> In search of a career.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.380]   >> Hey, I don't know what I want to do when I grow up.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.660]   Is that so wrong?
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.020]   >> No, I think it's great.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:59.140]   Now everybody's working at the revision three, except for you and me, John.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.140]   >> Yeah, I know.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.020]   But the thing is that they got so many guys there.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.580]   Now I want to see how fast they slow through that money.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.420]   >> Yeah, that day million ain't going to be whatever it is.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.420]   You know who I found?
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.420]   I got 15 million.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.420]   I was kind of shocked to learn this.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.980]   Remember that Will Ferrell's site, Funny or Die?
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.860]   They had that one really funny, the landlord where his partner's two-year-old daughter
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.860]   pretending to run.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.220]   >> One good bit.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.220]   >> One good bit.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.380]   >> Turns out they received 15 million adventure funding for creating this YouTube, you know,
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.740]   the idea was it was a YouTube for real comedy.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.540]   One good video and that's it.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.540]   There goes the 15 million.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.140]   >> If that was it, they're done?
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.660]   >> Well, I don't think they've closed the doors, but have you been there lately?
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.660]   I don't think anyone's--
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.260]   >> I've only watched the Will Ferrell stuff.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.260]   >> That's all anybody's watched.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.740]   >> And it's for you.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.300]   I think real comedy's pretty much crap in nowadays anyway.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.300]   >> Yeah, good point.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.900]   >> I'd much rather watch some person try to be funny on YouTube.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.540]   >> Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.900]   >> I'd rather watch the piano playing cat.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.900]   >> Really?
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.900]   >> No.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.900]   >> Is the piano playing cat?
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.580]   >> Oh, the cat cat's fantastic.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.580]   >> Is it on YouTube?
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.740]   >> Yeah, the piano playing cat, are you kidding me?
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.460]   You're the only guy who's not seen it apparently.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.460]   >> I haven't either.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.460]   >> Well, let's go.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.180]   >> Go to the devork.org/blog and you'll find it.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.180]   >> I've been--
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.180]   >> No, wait.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.180]   >> --chalk a little bit.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.180]   >> It's like a year ago.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.180]   >> It's like a piano.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.180]   Is that it?
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.180]   >> It's an old one, yeah.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.180]   It's got a little cat.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.180]   >> Yeah, it's old.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.660]   It says "caused in internet sensation."
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.300]   And this article's from April.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.300]   >> So what was that?
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.460]   >> Nora practice makes perfect checks.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.860]   >> Nora looks cool as a cucumber as she wows her audience.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.540]   >> Did he just run around?
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.980]   Or does he play a song?
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.980]   >> Here you go.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.980]   Here's--
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:40.980]   >> Yeah, she plays a song.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.980]   >> She plays a song.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   >> Nora, the piano playing cat, ladies and gentlemen, we've really sunk to a new low on this
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.980]   show.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.980]   And she's not making a song.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.980]   >> It's not--
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.980]   >> It's horrible.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.980]   >> It's like me.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.980]   >> It's a cat, I'd say.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.980]   How good are you expecting it to be?
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.980]   >> You said why is it so--
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.980]   >> Why is it so--
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.980]   >> Why is it so cool?
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.980]   If the cat actually plays something--
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.980]   >> I mean, it's some notes.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.980]   >> How do you promote something?
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.980]   >> That's not music.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.980]   That's typing.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.980]   >> It can't even be chopsticks.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.980]   If it did chopsticks, that would be awesome.
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.980]   >> That's pathetic.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:15.740]   >> Hey, you know what, I want to stick a parakeet on a piano and see how many notes it manages
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.740]   to walk over.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.740]   >> The point is, it's got more views than the entire funnier die site combined.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.740]   >> Well, they really haven't--
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.740]   >> Exactly.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.740]   >> They really haven't flogged funnier die.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.740]   >> 15 million, what are they spending it on?
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.740]   >> Obviously not on--
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   >> Limos and hookers.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.740]   >> Oh, of course.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.740]   >> Hey, if I had 15 million--
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.740]   >> Okay.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:39.740]   >> You, me and Don, we'd be out in Vegas right now.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.740]   Speaking of which, I saw Charlie Wilson's war last night.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.740]   >> What now was it?
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.740]   >> What a disappointment.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.740]   >> You have Aaron Sorkin.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.740]   Mike Nichols directs it.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.740]   Aaron Sorkin wrote it.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.740]   Tom Hanks.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.740]   He's not so good in it.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.740]   You know, who's good in it is-- what's his name?
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.740]   Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in it.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   >> Oh, that guy's an amazing actor.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   >> Well, actually, I should say, he's a good actor.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.740]   He's a great actor in this.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.740]   He's wearing a clown mustache that isn't quite believable.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.740]   He's got this-- he's like he's wearing a costume.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.740]   He might as well have a red nose.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.740]   But his acting is good.
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.740]   It's a bizarre-- it's a terrible movie.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.740]   Getting all the hype that they've spent huge money making this thing.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.740]   >> Well, you just cost him a few million bucks right there.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.740]   >> Good.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.740]   >> I was very disappointed.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.740]   >> Was it just boring and not interesting?
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.740]   >> Yeah, it was boring.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.740]   It's all about some Congressman, Texas Congressman you couldn't care less about,
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.740]   because he likes to--
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.740]   >> Charlie Wilson.
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.740]   >> Charlie Wilson.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.740]   He likes to drink and hang-- what made me think of it is it starts off in Vegas.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.740]   He's in a hot tub, and he's surrounded by three naked women,
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.740]   and a producer is trying to talk to him about making a Dallas that takes place in Washington, D.C.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.740]   Despite the fact he's surrounded by three beautiful naked women and in a hot tub,
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:58.740]   he can't help but be glued to the TV watching Dan rather in Afghanistan and a beard.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.740]   And it's downhill from that.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.740]   >> Mm.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.740]   >> Mm.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.740]   >> A downhill from that.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.740]   >> Mm.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.740]   >> Yeah, it's believable.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.740]   >> I want to go see "I Am Legend" in the movie.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.740]   >> I'm trying to see that.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.740]   >> Oh, God.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.740]   >> I hated it.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.740]   I thought it was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.740]   >> You're kidding me.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.740]   >> Is it supposed to be a remake of "Omega Man"?
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.740]   >> Oh, yeah, it's been made seven times this movie.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.740]   It's been made so many times.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.740]   It's a 1954 book.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.740]   It's been made so many times.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.740]   >> Oh, I hated it.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.740]   I sat there and I looked over my girlfriend.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.740]   She was-- I don't think she liked it too much either, but I only wanted to get up and walk out,
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.740]   and everyone sitting around me is captivated by it.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.740]   I'm just saying, I don't know, maybe just me, but I just thought it was a little bit of crap.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.740]   >> How about "No Country for Old Men"?
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.740]   Everybody says it.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740]   >> Oh, I loved it.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.740]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.740]   >> That's the movie to see this holiday season.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.740]   It's festive, it's light, it's lively.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.740]   Santa Claus is in it, right?
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.740]   >> Yeah, he was wonderful.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.740]   >> I think the last movie I saw was "The Golden Compass".
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.740]   That's stunk.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.740]   >> Yeah, so it was the most disjointed, fantasy-oriented movie of eyes.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.740]   >> Is it 175 million?
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.740]   >> Is there any more tech news here before we get off to the deep and here reviewing movies?
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.740]   >> Is it a ton?
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.740]   >> It's a holiday season.
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.740]   >> It's the holiday season, John.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   I thought we'd have a relaxed...
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.740]   >> Oh, you know, these movies that come out during the holiday season are always crappy.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.740]   >> What's your recommendation for a last-minute gift suggestion for our Twitter audience?
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.740]   >> Konyak.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.740]   >> Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.740]   >> What kind?
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.740]   >> Just Napoleon?
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.740]   >> No, no, Napoleon is especially Konyak, which is kind of a little better than VSOP.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.740]   You want an exo, Konyak.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.740]   Those are the ones that are always good.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:36.740]   And it's a very protected appellation, so if it says Konyak and it says exo, you can pretty
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.740]   much be assured it's a decent product no matter what brand you buy.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.740]   >> John doesn't want to talk about movies, but you get them started on wine, Konyak, that
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.740]   kind of thing.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.740]   >> Alcohol.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.740]   >> Alcohol.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.740]   >> Just don't know that going on and on about it.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.740]   >> He'll go.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   I was thinking a lovely Twit hoodie or pullover.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.740]   You can get those at the ThinkGeek store.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.740]   And if you want any Scotty Vest merchandise, we still have that coupon.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.740]   It's not too late.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.740]   Use my name Leo when you sign out at ScottyVest.com.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   You'll get 20% off everything you've purchased there.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.740]   It's not for the Twit merchandise at ThinkGeek, it's just for ScottyVest.com.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.740]   Leo is the coupon code.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.740]   We all wear ScottyVest stuff.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   >> My name is also, you can probably go to the Appalachian State school store and get
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.740]   that three in a row.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.740]   >> They're getting cheaper.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740]   >> T-shirt.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.740]   >> They're blowing them out.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.740]   So the Google DoubleClick deal is a done deal.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:32.740]   >> Except that they, even though they've managed to get by the FTC, they still have to
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.740]   do with the EU.
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.740]   >> I think the EU is dropping.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.740]   I think they're going to let them go.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.740]   >> I think to clear it, they have this as the EU has set a deadline of April 2nd to
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.740]   complete its review.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.740]   >> Wouldn't that be lousy if those stupid Belgians could stop the American
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.740]   underground?
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.740]   >> You know what's interesting Belgium may be no more in the near future.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.740]   >> What?
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.740]   Where's Belgium going?
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.740]   >> It's going to split.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.740]   It might split into its--
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.740]   >> That's hope it does.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.740]   >> Into what?
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.740]   >> Into a separate Flemish.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.740]   >> The Flemish and the--
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.740]   >> Yeah, the Flemish are irked about the fact that they're getting ripped off by the
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.740]   rest of the country.
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.740]   >> I'm a member of the Flemish separatist movement.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.740]   >> Why?
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.740]   >> Flemish.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.740]   >> Do they try to do that in Sebastian pole?
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.740]   >> Flemish.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.740]   >> All I want to know is where's Chame--where's the beer made?
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.740]   Is it in the Flemish part?
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.740]   >> No, no, it's a good question.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.740]   >> That's where we want to--you can have the French fries.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.740]   >> I want the Chame.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:36.740]   >> So the FTC said yes, go ahead and Google it's okay if you buy double click for $3.1
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.740]   billion combining the number one online ad--
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:47.740]   >> -- banner ad agency with the number one online contextual ad company to make a Internet advertising behemoth.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.740]   >> Yee-hawe.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.740]   >> Am I the only one who thinks Microsoft is freaking out right now?
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.740]   >> Yeah, they--remember Microsoft was very worried about this.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.740]   They went and bought some unknown company to compete with Google.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.740]   >> Why is Microsoft care what Google's doing?
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.740]   >> I don't see it either, you know, Microsoft should just concentrate on their own business.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.740]   >> It's ego.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.740]   It's ego.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:14.740]   I mean, think about it for years and years, Microsoft was top dog and they liked to bully people around and all of a sudden Google walked in underneath their nose.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.740]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.740]   >> And now it's one of these things where, you know, now it's a heavyweight fight and they don't like that anymore.
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.740]   And they like being the only big guy in the block and it's not happening anymore.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:29.740]   >> Microsoft, shortly after Google's double click acquisition, Microsoft paid twice as much for a quantitative.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.740]   And then Yahoo bought right media.
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.740]   So it's like--
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.740]   >> You know, with all the money these guys, some of these companies are accumulating.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.740]   I expect one of two companies, either Google or Cisco, to develop an operating system.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.740]   >> Cisco.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.740]   >> That's interesting.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.740]   >> That's for the PC.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.740]   >> You sound like you know something, John.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:51.740]   >> No, it's just been peculiar rumblings about Cisco's doing some sort of operating system.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.740]   >> Mm.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.740]   >> And they have the expertise to do it.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.740]   I mean, you know, the stuff works.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.740]   >> I got smart people in there.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:06.740]   >> Gambling ads are going to cost Microsoft, Yahoo and Google $31.5 million to Feds.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:13.740]   When it said that there's pseudom saying they took ads, illegal ads for gambling.
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.740]   Actually, it's the US Attorney for Eastern Missouri.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.740]   >> There you go.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.740]   >> US Attorney Catherine Hanaway.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.740]   Hey, you can laugh.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.740]   But Rudolph Giuliani was a US Attorney once too.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.740]   So the investigation conducted by the Eastern Missouri branch, along with the IRS and the
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.740]   FBI, dates to 2000.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.740]   They've been doing this for a long time.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.740]   Microsoft Google, Yahoo taking ads for gambling.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.740]   Oh, shocking.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.740]   I'm shocked.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.740]   Microsoft has to pay 21.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.740]   >> Well, they got to.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.740]   Why are they getting sued?
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.740]   What difference does it make?
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.740]   >> Has it got money?
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.740]   >> Yeah, that's the reason.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.740]   >> Oh, that's the prime reason.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.740]   It's because they have deep pockets.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.740]   Oh, look at these guys.
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:28:00.740]   I wonder if it's worth their while to give us $30 million on this bogus suit by the government.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.740]   >> Here's a little pork barrel.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.740]   Microsoft's paying 21 million, 7.5 million of which goes to the International Center for
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.740]   Missing and Exploited Children.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.740]   Does that have anything to do with gambling?
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.740]   Did I miss something?
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.740]   >> It's a lot.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.740]   I don't know.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.740]   >> That's why they're missing.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.740]   Maybe they're lost in Vegas.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.740]   >> Their bank has sold them off to slavery after they lost all their money.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.820]   >> Then $9 million get ready because they're going to spend $9 million on public service
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:34.100]   ads aimed at informing college age and younger folks that online gambling is illegal.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.100]   >> It sounds like what they did.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.740]   They wrapped up with RJ Reynolds and their whole--
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.740]   >> Right.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.740]   >> Tobacco.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.740]   >> Yahoo has to--
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.740]   >> Yahoo has to--
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.380]   >> --for college age kids too.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.380]   And that doesn't work.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.380]   So I don't know.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.220]   Yahoo has to spend $4.5 million on public service ads.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.220]   So let's see.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.220]   Let's add that up.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.820]   Now we're up to $13.5 million.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:59.140]   Google has to pay $3 million, which isn't much because you guess what Google's daily profit
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.140]   is?
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.140]   >> In the billions?
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.700]   >> $11 million.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.980]   So basically, this is like three hours.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:11.380]   Can you believe that?
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.380]   That's not--
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.380]   >> Just so much.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.380]   >> That's a slap on the wrist.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.380]   >> Slap on the wrist.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.380]   >> Oh, you don't want to--
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.380]   >> You don't want to--
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.620]   >> Just like grabbing some-- grabbing some easy money from these big companies because
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.580]   they got so much money, you know, they can't fight it.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.580]   So what are you going to do?
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.580]   >> I want to know how this--
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.580]   >> I'm just going to explain it to kids to get that.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.380]   We should set up a charity.
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.180]   From Live Science comes this interesting story.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.980]   Smart drink coasters.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.420]   This would be-- you should cover this in digital home.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.020]   Does CNET have a digital pub?
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.340]   >> I wish they did.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.140]   >> It could be right there.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.140]   >> Probably right now.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:50.620]   >> Tilla coasters, when you put them on the bar, they form a wireless mesh network.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.380]   >> No, brother.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.380]   >> What a--
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.740]   >> The coasters know when a drink has been placed on top of them and whether or not that
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.500]   drink is empty and will notify the bartender if you've run out.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.660]   >> Well, that's what I want the bartender to--
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.300]   >> What happens when you pull the drink off and it's--
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.660]   Boy, this guy's-- what happens if you drop the glass?
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.660]   >> It knows.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.500]   It says, oh, you need a new drink.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.500]   >> Oh, nice.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.540]   >> Maybe, can it tell if someone drops a roofie in your drink?
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.180]   >> That we need that.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.180]   >> That would be something.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.980]   >> Maybe the missing and exploited kids could donate some of their $9 million windfall to
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.980]   that.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:31.700]   >> You wouldn't-- so the idea is-- it's written in a Java development environment, by the way.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.700]   >> Wow.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.700]   >> So it's going to be slow.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.700]   >> Yeah, they've written some coasters.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.660]   There's some coaster libraries.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.660]   >> Hey, is that guy running out of his drink?
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.460]   No, he left an hour ago.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.500]   >> Wait a minute, I'm catching up.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.660]   Clearing memory, doing garbage collection.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.660]   Be right there.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.460]   >> Sounds like a solution looking for a problem.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.780]   >> All right, how about this one?
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.700]   Jerry Bruckheimer, the famous director.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.700]   What a Bruckheimer director.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.140]   He drinks all those-- did you--
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.140]   >> Movies with explosions.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.980]   >> He's a producer, more than a director.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.980]   >> Producer.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.980]   >> Not director, you're right.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.980]   Producer.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.140]   He did pirates.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.620]   He did-- I think he did MI1.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.820]   >> He did a million things.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.660]   The guy's just got nothing but money and time.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.860]   >> Well, good, because he's going to be writing some video games for MTV.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.260]   They've set up a gaming lab.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.860]   >> Yeah, well, now he's gone out too far.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.940]   >> Now you've done it, Bruckheimer.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.300]   >> So basically, he's going to take all his action sequences.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.340]   He's known for in all his movies, and they're just going to turn him into a video game.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.300]   >> He didn't say what kind of games he would create, but--
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.900]   >> Something with explosions.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.020]   >> But we can guess it will suck.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.980]   >> He said, he expects them to mirror his work in film and television.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.980]   >> Like I said, explosions.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.980]   >> Explosions and car chases.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.140]   >> And pirates.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.620]   >> Have you played-- you must have played rock band, right, Roger?
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:44.620]   >> Yes.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.620]   I know I've seen it played.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.340]   I have not physically been able to--
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.860]   >> Don, are you a rock band guy?
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.500]   >> Yeah, I played a few times.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.740]   >> Rock band or guitar hero?
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.380]   I guess that's kind of the question now, right?
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.380]   >> Oh, rock band.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.380]   >> Rock band, for sure.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.380]   Rock band's fun.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.140]   >> But you need to have that complete set of people to come with you.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.820]   >> Yeah, you need a band.
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.820]   >> Yes.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.820]   >> No, you can play it by yourself, but the whole point--
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.820]   >> That's kind of the best.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.060]   >> --is that you play it with, you know, that's the band portion of rock band.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.220]   >> Yeah, if you're playing rock band alone.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.660]   >> Like, hey, look at me, I'm saying the drums.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:20.820]   >> If it's the time to be in there, it sounds for me.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.580]   >> So they-- there's a London study on the Wii.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.540]   You know how they-- the Wii on the Wii-- first of all, you can't get a Wii.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.980]   Forget it, you can't get it.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:33.220]   We-- Nintendo's actually saying-- an analyst said Nintendo's going to lose a billion dollars
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.220]   this holiday season because they can't get any Wii's in the--
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.220]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   >> Right.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.220]   >> Whatever.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.700]   >> They're making 1.8 million a month and they still-- you go to a store, they sell in 30
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.820]   minutes.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.340]   There was a San Rafael store down the street from me that had 30--
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.620]   >> This is all planned.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.620]   This is all a scheme.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.620]   >> It is.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.780]   It's totally cabbage-patched 2008 or '07 or whatever.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.780]   Yeah, 2007.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.860]   >> It's tickle me Elmo all over again.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.860]   >> Well, I mean--
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.140]   >> The thing is, it's interesting is like how many people actually buy games after they
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.140]   own a Wii?
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.700]   >> Yeah, because they play that Wii sports.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.700]   That's all they play.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.700]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.700]   Nobody.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.700]   Is the answer really.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.180]   I mean, you probably buy Super Mario Galaxy.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.060]   You know, maybe Mario Party, because everyone buys that, I guess, if you're a Nintendo fan
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.060]   boy, but other than that, no one's buying games for that game.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.060]   >> What about Wii Fit?
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.220]   Would you buy that balance board, do the yoga, do the Wii?
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.220]   >> Oh, please, no one else.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.300]   >> There's a lot of good games people buy.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.300]   You guys are full of crap.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   >> What do you talk about?
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.300]   Give me other than Legend of the--
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   >> I give a buy.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   >> What are you playing?
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.140]   >> My daughter's the one that plays all those games and she's-- you know, she's got a pile
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.140]   of them.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.140]   >> How old is your daughter?
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.140]   >> 13.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.740]   >> That's out of that age, isn't it?
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.740]   Now here's the thing.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:44.540]   Do you think that she-- that gets good exercise from the Wii sports, the boxing, the bowling,
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.540]   the tennis?
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:50.380]   >> You know, I think that just-- you know, I think you get a good shot at Carpal Tunnel
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.940]   Syndrome playing those games or tend to night.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.940]   >> People to prove--
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.340]   >> I got tend to night is playing the bowling game.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.500]   >> To prove that they're really working out when they're doing these dorky games.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.660]   Like, oh, no, the next day I was sore.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.780]   >> You know, they need-- I'm just waiting for the lawsuits.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.220]   >> For someone who gets some sort of repetitive stress injury and they can blame it on the
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.220]   Wii, that's--
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.220]   >> I was sore.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.260]   >> There's a settlement waiting to happen.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.180]   >> So they did a study.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:19.060]   Researchers at Liverpool, John Moore's University and colleagues in the British Medical Journal
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:25.580]   writing, they took a bunch of 13 to 15-year-old kids, six boys, five girls.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:30.620]   They played four Wii games, 15 minutes each, while wearing monitor devices to record how
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.740]   much energy they burned.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.540]   >> It adds up to about-- get this.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:43.020]   If you do all the Wii sports stuff, about 2% more energy over, you know, a Game Boy.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.020]   2%.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:49.660]   >> Yeah, that's interesting, Leo, but that's kind of a specious thing when you start really
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:50.660]   looking at burning calories.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.780]   You can get one of those exercise bikes and you really don't burn that much.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.060]   It takes hours and hours.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.060]   >> Well, I know.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.660]   But this is-- they burned about 60 calories an hour.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.820]   >> Well, it's better than eating peanuts.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.060]   >> I don't know.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.980]   You might burn four calories eating peanuts.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.420]   I'm not sure.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.900]   60 calories an hour.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.580]   You take a walk, you're going to burn three times that.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.860]   >> Yeah, but any game console, nobody's-- like, I wouldn't say--
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.860]   >> Well, that's right.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.420]   >> You're pushing the idea that these sports maker exercise for the kids.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.140]   >> Oh, well, yeah, I don't know who's pushing that, but yeah, that's nonsense.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   >> No, it's tender.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.140]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.100]   >> You want exercise, go outside and run around like a maniac.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.100]   >> I don't know.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.700]   I have bone around your throat and have the dog play with it.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.300]   >> Have you done this, Don?
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.860]   >> Yeah, well, no, my parents did a long time ago.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.660]   They were hoping for something good to happen and then work.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.660]   I ran away.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.820]   >> I have bone around your throat.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.460]   And the dog jazes you and you go.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.900]   >> Okay, this is an interesting form of parenting and explains a lot about it.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:49.900]   >> That's good.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.620]   >> That was actually a-- if I'm not mistaken with Don describing something that you have
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.300]   to have done to even work at CNET.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.300]   >> Oh.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.300]   Well, yeah, it's a rite of passage.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   >> It is.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.420]   They tie a bone around your throat.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.980]   I think Halsey Minor used to do that.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.820]   Before he left, that was kind of his thing.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.340]   Jeff Bezos asks you who would win in a fight at Gorilla and Halsey would just tie a bone
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.340]   around your throat.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.340]   I used to work for Halsey.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.700]   For one week, I worked for Halsey.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.700]   Wasn't a good thing.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.860]   Wasn't a good relationship.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.420]   Queen Elizabeth II has a YouTube channel.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.260]   There you go.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.260]   [LAUGH]
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.380]   First, the piano playing cat.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.380]   Now the queen.
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.420]   >> Royalty needed to get into it eventually.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.420]   >> Oh, her own special royal channel.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:39.340]   >> I wonder how many friends she has.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.140]   Is it part of the royal channel?
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.700]   >> It is the royal channel.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.300]   >> The official channel with the British monarchy.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.300]   >> Yes.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.300]   >> I guess they're trying to raise money.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.820]   >> Oh, yeah, they need money.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.300]   >> Well, no, because--
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:55.940]   >> Now that Dan JK Rowling's richer than me, I need to have a channel like--
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:03.300]   >> The royal page's modern video clip show shots of get this garden parties, state visits,
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.540]   the queen, the many British prime ministers who have served during her reign, and the
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.140]   day in the life of her son Prince Charles.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.140]   >> What do you think?
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.140]   Five viewers?
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.140]   Ten maybe?
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.620]   >> Oh no, so far there's 5,680 subscribers.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   >> Are you there?
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.620]   >> That's pretty good.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.620]   >> Yes.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.420]   >> And there's 238,039 channel views.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.420]   >> What do you Google for that?
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.420]   >> The queen's or queen?
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.540]   >> I just went into YouTube and typed in Queen Elizabeth, and it's just the royal channel.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.700]   >> Be careful what you typed there.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   >> You know.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   >> You know, "Tube Queen."
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.780]   >> The number of Queen Elizabeth's in San Francisco.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.780]   >> Yes.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.780]   Quite a few, actually.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.940]   Well, anyway, I'm just glad she's got a sight.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.860]   I think that's, you know, that just shows how--
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:48.860]   >> How heavy, very.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.860]   >> She is.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.780]   >> The long reign over us.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:52.780]   >> Long reign.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.220]   >> Long reign over us.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.220]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.220]   >> Hell and she's a glorious--
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.620]   >> What does she do for the thing?
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.620]   >> No, I do.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.620]   >> No, she's a queen.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:04.620]   >> She's a queen.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.620]   >> She's a queen.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.620]   >> You know what I mean?
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.820]   Like, you're almost sitting around and just entertaining people.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.620]   >> Did she see the movie?
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:21.260]   >> Whatever jobs is to act as kind of an ambassador for the British government on matters that
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.780]   may not require like an actual legal representative from the United Kingdom.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.780]   >> You've got to learn, Don.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.500]   You can't ask Roger a question like that.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.500]   >> I guess so.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   I was--
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.500]   >> He will tell you the answer.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.780]   Well, it's a matter of fact.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.580]   Many people don't know what the queen is.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.580]   It serves many ceremonial functions.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.900]   >> Yeah, she does.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.900]   >> She does.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.140]   >> That's why her face is all over the place.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.540]   >> She's-- they're on the money.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.940]   She's even on the Canadian money.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.620]   >> She's posing a lot.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.180]   She spends a lot of time posing for pictures.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.380]   I'm kind of sad about this.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.900]   Chuck Norris is a suing a publisher.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.900]   Not for them.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:58.900]   >> No, for what?
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.300]   >> Well, it's for a book that he says unfairly exploits his name.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.660]   It's the Chuck Norris lists.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:08.340]   Publisher Penguin published a book of the Chuck Norris Mythical Facts.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.860]   I always thought-- I always figured Chuck, you know, liked this.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:13.860]   Wouldn't you?
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.020]   >> It gives the background on this.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.420]   I didn't know about this.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.500]   It's about Chuck.com.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:26.740]   It's a website that's been around at least seven or eight years, I think.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.740]   And it's hysterical.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.900]   And I always assume, well, Chuck Norris must know about this and like it, because it's
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.620]   kind of, you know, it's promoting Chuck Norris.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.620]   Read some of them.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.620]   Go to truthaboutchuck.com.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.540]   You'll see what I'm saying.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.100]   >> Is it the site that's being sued?
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.100]   >> No.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.780]   Penguin compiled 400 facts from the website.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.820]   Actually the author was the guy who runs the site.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.420]   And it's called The Truth About Chuck Norris.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.980]   400 facts about the world's greatest human.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.940]   And he sues them.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.820]   The lawsuit says, yeah, read some of them.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.140]   They're very funny.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.140]   >> Is that where--
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.940]   >> Haven't you read-- haven't you guys seen these?
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:05.940]   These are great.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.780]   >> I really don't follow his career anymore.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.780]   >> No, no, no.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.780]   It has nothing to do with Chuck Norris.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.180]   >> American hero.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.180]   >> It just--
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.180]   >> I can't find this site.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.500]   >> All right, let me find it here.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.500]   Hold on a second.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.500]   >> Chuck Norris's tears cure cancer.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.780]   Too many is never cried.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.020]   >> Yes, now you're getting the idea.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.020]   [laughter]
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.020]   >> Come on, give me some of that.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.420]   >> I guess it's funny.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.860]   >> I never seem like somebody with a huge sense of humor.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.860]   >> Apparently not.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.100]   I think if somebody write a book about me like that, I'd be very--
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.700]   >> Associated Press article, Trading Karate Chops for Lawyers,
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.220]   Tough Guy Actor Chuck Norris is taking on a new book titled,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.980]   The Truth About Chuck Norris, saying it's a big lie.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.860]   And he wants to stop its distribution.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.860]   >> Of course it is.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.140]   Apparently unclear.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.140]   All right, let me--
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:51.840]   >> They just called it fact-
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.580]   >> Chuck Norris facts.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.100]   Guns don't kill people.
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.220]   Chuck Norris kills people.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.660]   There is no theory of evolution.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.660]   Just a list of animals Chuck Norris allows to live.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.500]   Chuck Norris does not sleep.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.180]   He waits.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.380]   >> Did you know he's currently suing NBC, claiming law and order,
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.220]   or trademark names for his left and right legs?
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.060]   I didn't know that.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.700]   >> When the boogie--
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.700]   >> It goes a little interesting tidbit at the end of this AP story.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.420]   It says Norris has been in more than 20 films.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.460]   The actor was a six-time, undefeated world professional
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.460]   middleweight Karate champion.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.700]   And in 1997, became the first man in the Western hemisphere
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.940]   to be awarded the eighth-degree black belt grandmaster
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.420]   in Taekwondo.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.100]   >> I'm telling you, you don't want to muck with Chuck.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.660]   When the boogie man goes to sleep every night,
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.940]   he checks his closet for Chuck Norris.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.460]   Usually, a guy who would have to get the eighth degree
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.740]   but wouldn't have a sense of humor.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.260]   >> No.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.460]   Chuck Norris is the reason Waldo's hiding.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.980]   I mean, after all, his chief ex-boy is pain, so--
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.380]   >> Let's see what--
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.500]   >> Anyway, I've known about these facts for a long time.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.140]   There's a lot of parodies of this.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.380]   And I just always assumed that Chuck Norris must know about it
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.140]   and think it's funny.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.020]   I mean, why wouldn't you?
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.620]   It's very flattering.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:06.980]   No.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.140]   >> He's not possible that he didn't know about it.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.940]   >> Jesus, we see man.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.260]   It says, according to the lawsuit,
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.420]   "Some of the facts in the book are racist, lewd,
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:22.220]   or portray Mr. Norris as engaged in illegal activities."
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.740]   Like this, Chuck Norris can charge a cell phone
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:29.180]   by rubbing it against his beard."
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.380]   I don't know if that-- OK.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.420]   >> You know, the funny thing is you really can't sue over
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.100]   a parodies satire or human things like that.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.460]   He doesn't have a leg to stand on in a lawsuit like this.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.340]   Even if they're named law or order.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.540]   Either leg wouldn't.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.420]   He couldn't stand on that.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:51.460]   So in a man in Chicago, he's now suing the city of Chicago.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.460]   He's an attorney, of course, over its anti-cell phone bill.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.180]   You know, we're very close, I think, about six months off
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.260]   before the bill takes effect in California
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.500]   and 30 other states nationwide to prevent--
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.780]   to make it illegal to talk on a phone while you're driving.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.500]   But it's not--
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.900]   >> No, it's 2008, isn't it, next year?
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.300]   So that's what I said about six months.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.100]   What did I say?
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.100]   Six months.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.660]   >> Oh, no, I thought it started at the end of 2008.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:13.460]   >> Oh, at the end of?
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.140]   Oh, OK.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.420]   I don't think it's sooner than that.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:19.140]   >> And the end of 2008 swings around that's way.
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.580]   >> OK.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.580]   >> Soon.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.100]   >> Yes.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:21.100]   >> Onward.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.060]   >> But it's been that way.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.620]   And yes, let's not compare.
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.300]   Let's just go on.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.060]   What's the story?
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.380]   >> In Chicago, it's been the law for a couple of years.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.740]   They've actually raised quite a bit of money.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:34.060]   This guy's suing, saying, hey, they should have put some signs up.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.300]   It's illegal.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.740]   What if you're out of town?
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.780]   He wants them to return the $2 million in fines.
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.140]   He says--
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.060]   >> I agree with him.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.060]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.380]   >> I've been to Chicago a number of times.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.940]   I didn't know they had this law.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.700]   >> Well, but as Alderman Bernard Stone points out,
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.380]   we can't put signs for every law.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.780]   >> Every Wacko law, you should.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.060]   >> Is that a Wacko law?
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.020]   Talking on a cell phone while driving?
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.020]   >> No, you've been talking on a cell phone
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.780]   while driving for the last 15 years.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.100]   And then they changed it at the last minute out
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.980]   of the blue in some town that you'd only
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.180]   visit once in a while.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.020]   Give me a break.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.780]   >> Well, you're going to like this then.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:10.500]   >> I doubt it.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.140]   >> In the UK where it's been illegal to talk on a handheld phone.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.980]   You can use a hands-free, but illegal to talk on a handheld
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:20.460]   phone since 2003, nobody's paying attention to the law.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.580]   So they've decided to up the punishment.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.980]   It was a fine-- they say about half a million
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.740]   Britons violate the law daily.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.820]   The fine was 60 pounds.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:33.820]   They are now increasing it to an unlimited fine,
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.740]   depending on the judge, up to the judge's description,
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.980]   and up to two years in jail for talking on a cell phone
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:45.100]   or using an MP3 player, a GPS device.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.740]   >> Wait a minute, using a GPS device?
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.060]   >> I applaud them.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.020]   >> You do?
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.740]   >> The only way to stop it is to make them
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.980]   watch the Queen's channel.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.820]   >> I'm watching the Queen's channel.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.340]   You can't take it me.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.340]   >> I don't know what do you think?
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.980]   On the other hand, if you've ever been run into
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:07.420]   by somebody on a phone as I have, people who are on the phone
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.100]   are not very good drivers.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.860]   >> No, they're just-- yeah.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.900]   Some of them have the double whammy.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.140]   They're on the phone and they're women drivers.
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.500]   >> Oh, God.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.540]   >> Dvorakado/blog.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.540]   >> Hey, you know, we have like two women listeners
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.140]   so I can get away with this kind of material.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.140]   >> It's actually true.
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.420]   Both of them are offended now.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.940]   So now we have one left.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.860]   >> We have one left.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.900]   Please don't leave.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.340]   Actually, the Queen has an iPod.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.860]   Maybe she listens.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.860]   >> She could.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.820]   She might have one of her assistants downloaded
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.860]   and sync it onto her iPod daily or weekly.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.100]   >> Could be a secret geek.
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.420]   She is the second richest woman in Britain.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.900]   All right, I'm going to wrap this up
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.140]   because it's just not going anywhere.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.940]   And everybody wants to-- everyone who wants to go
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.300]   have cognac and eggnog.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.220]   Do you put eggnog?
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.540]   What do you put in your eggnog, John?
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.220]   Do you put--
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.300]   >> You put a mixture of brandy and rum.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.940]   >> Oh, together.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.500]   >> I'm going to try that.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.340]   >> Rum.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.500]   >> Rum.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.860]   Rum.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.180]   >> Yeah, and now you have to use good rum,
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:10.020]   the dark, some of the dark, tasty stuff.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.500]   >> 151?
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.260]   >> No, don't use that for God's sake.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.180]   You kill somebody.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.100]   >> Have some eggnog.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.540]   I'd like to thank the folks at Audible
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.380]   for providing the--
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.460]   wherewithal to make this podcast possible,
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.300]   right about now they're going, why, why, why?
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.020]   >> A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.

[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.780]   It's not too late to listen to, it's a wonderful life.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.660]   Yes, you heard me right.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:43.620]   Zuzu's petals are on audible.com, the audio version.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.220]   It's actually a radio dramatization.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.980]   You want to hear a little bit of it's a wonderful life?
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:49.940]   This is kind of a sad story.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.140]   This used to be public domain and then somebody bought it.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.300]   That's why you saw it on all the TV.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.020]   >> John, does that save you?
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:55.620]   >> Here's Zuzu.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.900]   >> See, you didn't go full with it.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.380]   >> Oh.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.580]   >> Don't throw a watch.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.060]   >> Suicide.
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.900]   >> What's his name, Casper?
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.100]   Oscar?
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:04.540]   Clarence.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.620]   >> I'm an angel.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.140]   >> I'm an angel.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.540]   >> I'm a little slut.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.380]   Hello?
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.540]   >> Violence odd body.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:09.980]   >> Violence.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:10.980]   >> AS2.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.620]   AS2, what's the AS2?
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.460]   >> You had Elmer flood playing the character?
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.660]   >> That's the guy and it's James Stewart to,
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.100]   "I'll try to do a joy short."
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.180]   So that's the actual dramatization.
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:23.940]   You could listen to that.
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.780]   I mean, talk about a festive Christmas Eve.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.900]   Why don't you run over to audible.com/twig.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.700]   They got actually a lot of movies dramatized.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.940]   It's kind of neat for the radio.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.740]   I guess that was a big thing for a while.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:40.660]   Alfred Hitchcock, has-- there's all the Alfred Hitchcock movies
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.060]   you can listen to.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.460]   >> Well, actually--
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.460]   >> Great books.
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.580]   >> In the '30s and '40s.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.020]   >> --re-allocations.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.340]   >> And a whole lot of radio theater
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.100]   with all this kind of stuff.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.540]   >> Movie collection is--
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.580]   one collection, six hours, you get Rebecca,
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.980]   foreign correspondent, shadow of a doubt.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.260]   Joseph Cotton and Spellbound, Ray Milan
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:01.260]   and Strangers on a Train, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Robert Montgomery,
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:05.420]   and Ida Lupino in the original '39 Steps,
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.900]   and Tallulah Bankhead in Lifeboat.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.140]   How do you like that?
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.980]   Audible.com-- see, this is not just books.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.260]   45,000 books.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:16.500]   Yes, many different devices, but also a lot of other stuff.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.940]   Kind of-- if you love audio, it's a--
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.100]   I'm actually being serious now.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.100]   It's a great thing to join Audible.
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.380]   Audible.com/twig.
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.220]   We thank them so much for their support of the Twit Podcast.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.900]   And they'll be a little something in your pay packet this week,
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.900]   folks, for Marvel.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.140]   Kind of got quiet in here.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.380]   >> Oh, I think you're still doing the ad.
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:40.420]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.220]   >> Yeah, we're all in awe.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.700]   >> Aw.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.140]   Aw, shucks.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.940]   >> Hey, so I'm looking at this-- I'm looking at this thing,
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:50.700]   by the way, this-- news.aol.com, which is a new news
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.660]   competitor, I guess, with Google.
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:54.140]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.500]   >> Yeah, it sucks.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.380]   >> I mean, I'm looking at-- they have all these slideshows
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.020]   that don't work on Firefox.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.700]   >> Oh, that's not a good start.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.340]   >> No.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.180]   >> Snow blamed for nine deaths in central US,
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.780]   and then you press the button, and photo gallery,
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.260]   a winner, it kind of looks more like CNN.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.460]   Does this look like CNN?
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.180]   >> Looks like a news aggregator.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.420]   >> It looks like-- yeah, it also looks like Facebook.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.140]   >> It's got that same theme, look, you know, that Facebook--
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:21.780]   >> It's out the hallway.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.620]   >> It feels-- you know, this is actually, I think,
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:24.900]   if you look at this--
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.020]   oh, yeah, their British queen takes up YouTube right there.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.140]   There's a picture of her.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.420]   If you look at this, I don't think they're
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.220]   trying to compete with Google, because that's
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.100]   really more automated feeling.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.220]   >> There's a new Yahoo.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.980]   There might be a new Yahoo's newspaper.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.020]   >> Yeah, or even a newspaper with a little--
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.020]   but then it has the kind of social networking,
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.580]   user submitted news, a little diggy stuff.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.580]   It's got a blog chatter, it's got tags.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.860]   It's kind of a-- I think they're trying to do a modern newspaper.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.260]   >> Yeah, well, they're doing a crappy job of it.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.700]   Anyway, so we're done.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.140]   >> Yeah, you can get out of here now.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.900]   You're just cranky as hell.
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.860]   What are you doing for Christmas?
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.100]   >> I'm going up to Washington.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.860]   >> No wonder you want to get out of here.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.100]   >> Yeah, anything to get out of here.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.740]   >> All right, Port Angeles, have a great time.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.140]   Catch John on cranky geeks.
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.580]   He's still there, he hasn't left.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.140]   Who does that?
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.220]   Is that ZD or CNET?
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.340]   That's ZD, right?
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:14.660]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.100]   >> Ziftives.
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.140]   >> Did you know that Larry Bud Melman died this year?
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.660]   >> Yeah, in fact, ever looking at the lost entertainers
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.140]   on AOL News Beta.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:23.940]   >> That's what I want to know.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.580]   >> Not going to anything.
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.380]   >> It's only Shira.
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.900]   >> Yeah, Charles Nelson Riley.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.260]   I loved him.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.220]   Mr. Whipple.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.180]   Should we have a moment of silence for Mr. Whipple?
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.380]   Okay, that's it.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.220]   >> So what are you doing, Leo?
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.860]   >> Or to flag.org/blog, I am going to Egypt.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.380]   >> Ooh, why?
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.340]   >> It's a segregation.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.300]   >> Because that's where the pyramids are.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.980]   Tomorrow I'm flying out to Boston.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.860]   I'm going to have Christmas with my mom and my sister.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:53.180]   And then the day after we're going to Egypt, the whole family.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:53.860]   >> Why?
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.300]   >> Why?
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.700]   >> To see the pyramids.
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.980]   Why else?
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:58.740]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.740]   >> Have you ever seen the pyramids?
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.340]   The Sphinx.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.380]   The Nile.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.220]   The Great River Ganges?
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.380]   Oh, no, that's somewhere else.
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.340]   >> That's an idea.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.820]   [LAUGH]
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.540]   >> Have you ever been to Egypt, John?
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.620]   >> No, I've been to the Middle East,
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.860]   but I've not made Egypt.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.020]   And I kind of regret it because I had a shot at it
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.380]   once years ago and I missed it.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.100]   And then I haven't really had another shot.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:21.540]   >> Come on, the plane.
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.220]   Come on.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.100]   Let's all go.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.220]   Let's all go to Egypt.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.580]   What do you say?
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:26.580]   >> Still it.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.100]   >> I'd go for it like an Egyptian.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.380]   >> I'm looking forward to it.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.500]   It's going to be fun all of it.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.540]   So that means there'll be no Twit next weekend or the weekend
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.700]   after we'll be back though.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.500]   After CES, everybody's going to come back from CES.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.140]   We'll have a big CES wrap up Twit.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.180]   That'll be on January 14th.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.260]   That's where we'll return.
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.500]   So I'm going to miss you all, but have a wonderful holiday.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:50.020]   Everybody, Roger Chang, I noticed that you're,
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.300]   this is funny, you're a Skype name.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.180]   You don't use Skype a lot.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.020]   >> No.
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:57.100]   >> This is your old call for help account.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.380]   >> Yeah, no, it was something I had to think of both.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.220]   And then there's the only thing that came to my mind
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.060]   at the time.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:02.900]   >> It's been a while.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.980]   Roger Chang, now part of revision three,
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.860]   catch them on Techzilla and System.
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:07.820]   I'm really glad to hear that.
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.980]   That's great.
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:11.620]   They pretty much have recreated tech TV over there.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:12.460]   That's great.
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.860]   >> Yes.
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.540]   >> And good.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.660]   Have a wonderful Christmas.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.700]   You're in Modesto right now.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.980]   It's as wonderful as it gets in Modesto unfortunately.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.820]   >> Don Rizinger, you're in Upper New York State
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.980]   where it's, we're happy to say not snowing.
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.900]   >> Oh yeah, life is good.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.580]   It's a little rainy out, but that's, I'll take it.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.140]   >> You're going to have a kind of a traditional
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.220]   New York State Christmas?
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.940]   >> Yeah, you know, shoveling and slogging through the snow.
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:40.780]   Yeah, life is good.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.620]   >> That'll be great.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.540]   Don, great to talk to you.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:45.020]   Thedigitalhome.cnet.com.
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.860]   We thank you all for being such a great,
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.820]   great audience all year long.
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.660]   We'll be back next year with lots more Twit.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.020]   I'm Leo Laporte, another Twit.
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:55.180]   >> This is amazing.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.020]   >> Is in the can.
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.100]   Happy holidays, everybody.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:19.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.460]   >> I should have paid attention.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:23.300]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.220]   Too much work.
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.980]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.700]   My server's completely collapsed.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.980]   So here's the deal.
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.260]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.500]   but I have a hell of a time
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.700]   when blue screens like forget it.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.060]   I'm killing you.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.660]   (laughing)
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.080]   Round the board.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.780]   I'm on the Twit.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.620]   Do on the Twit.
