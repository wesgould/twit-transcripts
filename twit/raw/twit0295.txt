[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.700]   starting with, from South Austin, Texas, El Diablo.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700]   And Little Jerry, right here on my shirt.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700]   Mr. Brian Brushwood.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700]   Hey, how you doing, Leo?
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700]   Great to see you, bro.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.700]   Dude, always love being here.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.700]   You're in town for scam school.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700]   Yeah, just shot three nights of scam school, 12 episodes.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   Wow.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.700]   Taking a day off, visiting Petaluma.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.700]   Shut 12 episodes at once.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   Yeah, we rock four of those at night, and it's just six.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.700]   We never know what we're going to get in terms of the crowds
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.700]   or how drunk people are going to be.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.700]   So you want to get them while they're drunk?
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700]   Yeah, well, but not too drunk.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700]   So it's like, you know, early in the evening,
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   that's when you do like the puzzles,
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.700]   maybe middle evening card tricks, and at the end you're like,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.700]   which is longer?
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.700]   My left thumb or my right thumb.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   Now give me a drink.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.700]   Also with us, which is longer?
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.700]   Your left thumb or right thumb?
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700]   Becky Worley.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.700]   I will be.

[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700]   Now I have up for you just your Twitter handle, Borley.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700]   That's me, B-Worley.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.700]   Is there anything else you'd like me to--
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   Becky's legs.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700]   I'm with you.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.700]   Becky's legs.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.700]   Is there a Becky's leg Twitter account?
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.700]   There definitely is.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.700]   There's a Becky's leg Twitter account.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700]   Oh, man.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   Is it a busy account?
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.700]   I don't know.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700]   I'll tell you one of the stories we have coming up later on on
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   Twitter.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   All right.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   We'll stay with that.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.700]   That's exciting.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700]   Also here, good to have her.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.700]   In fact, she's got a specific beat today from this week in law.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   Denise Howell.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   Good to see you.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700]   Bags and baggage and blog rhythms.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700]   Good to see you.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.700]   It's great to have you on.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   Wonderful, always.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.700]   Thanks for being here.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   And finally, as if that weren't enough, the scobalizer is also
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   a little bit more than enough to have you on the way to the
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   ground.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700]   It's a beautiful day.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.700]   Sounds like that should be in the Caribbean.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.700]   Half moon bay, man.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.700]   It would be if they had more than 12 days of sunny year.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.700]   There's years to be one of them and four scobles inside with us.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.700]   Oh, Robert, thank you for joining us.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   We appreciate this.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   I can look at it out the window.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.700]   Maybe I'll take the camera and show it to you.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.700]   It's beautiful.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   Beautiful day.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700]   It is.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.700]   It's a rare, beautiful day in Half Moon Bay.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.700]   Normally, the foggiest place in the world like that.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.700]   Wow.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.700]   It's big.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.700]   It's big out there.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.700]   That's the big surfing spot, Mavericks.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.700]   Somebody just died there a week ago.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.700]   Oh, dear.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.700]   That's terrible.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.700]   Let's see.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   Way to bring the room down, Robert.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   Nice way to start off the twist.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.700]   Great.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.700]   Super.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.700]   It's going to be a major operation.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.700]   A little later on, Robert's going to start a new feature on
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   Twitter news of next week.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.700]   No, seriously.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   Robert wants to do that.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   All right.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.700]   Like stuff people will be talking about next week.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.700]   I'd like that.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.700]   I got a few things.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.700]   We were talking during the pre-show about these new 3D cameras that are coming
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.700]   out tomorrow, and I got some iPad apps.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.700]   We actually got a little bit of a discussion over 3D because I'm of the
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.700]   opinion.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700]   It's a gimmick.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.700]   I just don't understand why people are still making 3D stuff.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.700]   I don't think anybody's going to end up buying it.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   Consumers are going to be upset that they fell for this scam.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700]   But then you, Brian, you like the idea of 3D, at least in terms of
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.700]   movies in the theater.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   Yes.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.700]   Well, don't hate the idea for the implementation.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.700]   Certainly we have a very crude implementation of 3D right now.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   We have the same crude implementation we had in 1956 with House of Wax.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   We do and don't.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.700]   But when you get to, for example, James Cameron created the entire real
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.700]   3D company so that he could tell the kind of stories he wanted to tell,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   and he made big changes as far as the circular polarized lenses.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   He can tell your head left to right, and he's getting ready to make more
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.700]   announcements, saying that Avatar 2 is going to be in more than 24 frames
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.700]   per second, which we haven't seen.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.700]   What does that mean?
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.700]   I mean, that's what film is.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.700]   So it means he's shooting it like video style.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.700]   No, no, he's talking about '48 or maybe even 60 frames per second.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.700]   It won't be the advantage.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.700]   Well, Roger Ebert wrote a giant article trashing 3D, saying, "I hate the fact
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   that we're spending all our time focusing on 3D.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.700]   I think, like you, he says, I think it's a gimmick."
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.700]   He says, you know, a decade ago I saw film shot in 60 frames per second,
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.700]   and that was magical.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.700]   That was like a window into another world.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.700]   Now, if James Cameron, who is a big believer in 3D, also seems to agree and says,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.700]   let's also take it to 60 frames per second, that's going to be a win.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.700]   And I think this is the equivalent of it's a good idea with rough implementation,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.700]   and as each successive generation gets better and better and better,
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.700]   there'll be a time when all of a sudden 3D won't be a joke.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   Now, let me stay unequivocally.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.700]   I love 3D in the theater.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.700]   I hate 3D in the home right now.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   I think it is gimmicky.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.700]   I think it doesn't do snazzy.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.700]   I think the glasses are horribly overpriced.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.700]   And, you know, of course, there are some with the passive lenses now,
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.700]   and they are dimmer, but it's a step in the right direction.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.700]   And I'm not -- I have no problem with 3D as a motivating force to get us
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.700]   to develop new technologies.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.700]   Did you see -- did you see there was one YouTube video, somebody released,
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.700]   of them using multiple projectors to create a floating, hovering 3D image in the fog
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.700]   that you could see from different sides as you walked around it?
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.700]   Do you guys see that?
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.700]   I haven't seen that.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.700]   We've seen sort of holographic projectors in one form or another ever since Star Wars,
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.700]   but it just doesn't -- and there's multiple technologies for it.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.700]   It's just what's the practical application?
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.700]   Why do we need this?
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.700]   Why is the industry shoving this down our throat?
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.700]   Well, to sell more TVs.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.700]   Right.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.700]   And -- and, you know, starting the irony was the movie industry started it
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.700]   because they wanted to give us something we couldn't get at home.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.700]   Right?
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.700]   Because they wanted people to keep going to theaters,
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.700]   and then the TV industry responded by, "Okay, we'll make those, too!"
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.700]   And that's the hard thing.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.700]   It's like -- it's a rough position I'm trying to defend,
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.700]   because I am in favor of a novel, awesome experience at the theater,
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.700]   which 3D could be a part of, but I am not in favor of the commercialization
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.700]   and the way people are telling you you got to buy a 3D TV --
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.700]   do not buy a 3D TV right now.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.700]   If you want to get into 3D now is not the time.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.700]   Well, and of course you don't have that choice.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.700]   I do.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.700]   I just bought an -- here I am.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.700]   Here I am.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   Here I am arguing for a 3D TV because most of the best TVs from every manufacturer
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.700]   have 3D capability.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.700]   You may not use it, but you're going to get the top of the line plan.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.700]   Yeah, what we were talking about before the show started was these new cameras
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.700]   are going to get hooked together, and you're going to be able to film 3D at home
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.700]   and put it up on YouTube.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.700]   And I didn't even know this until I visited this company on Friday,
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.700]   but YouTube, if you put the video side by side of the left and right eye,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.700]   it actually lets you watch 3D on YouTube, and it lets you choose the kind of glasses
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:54.700]   or TV set that you have it senses that there's these 3D videos that you're putting up
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   and lets you switch them.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.700]   It's really smart.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.700]   Well, we saw the Sony Bloggy come out at CES, which had the same 3D capabilities.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.700]   It didn't come out.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.700]   It was an app.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.700]   They talked about it.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.700]   They don't know when they're going to ship that sucker.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.700]   This is the -- well, you know what came out this week?
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.700]   Let's talk about real stuff that came out this weekend.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.700]   Let's talk about this weekend.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.700]   This week, Nintendo 3DS.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.700]   They say --
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.700]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.700]   I saw it.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.700]   I saw it.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.700]   You've seen it?
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.700]   Not impressive.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.700]   Really?
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.700]   It's got a little slider.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.940]   And I think this is the best thing, and I wish all 3D devices had this.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.260]   You could turn down the 3D or turn it up.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.260]   It's okay.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.260]   Stuff jumps out at you.
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.260]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.260]   And it's glasses free.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.260]   Yeah, it's glasses.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.700]   It's lenticular, which means you have to hold your head just in the right position.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.700]   But with a single viewing screen, that's not hard.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.700]   It's easy with that kind of thing.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.420]   And you've got total control over it, and it's moving according to your head, so that's
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.420]   not a big deal.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:53.220]   It's interesting how the reviews range from a game changer to -- they sold 113,000 of
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.220]   them in the UK.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.380]   Well, I'll tell you, if there's ever a demographic that this is ripe for, it's going to be the
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.380]   children who are buying the 3D.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.740]   Yeah, well, my 9-year-old nephew, well, I consider him a nephew.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.740]   He's like a God child.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.740]   But anyways, that's not important.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.740]   He's a sucker.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.740]   He's a sucker.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.740]   He's been playing the top.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.740]   No, he's being suckered by Nintendo.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.740]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740]   Who's convincing him?
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.740]   He needs to buy this thing.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.420]   He is getting a novel experience in a low definition format, which is exactly what
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.420]   9-year-olds want.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.420]   It's a toy.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.180]   It's not only that, but in Petaluma High School, Patrick says the nimbo.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.780]   Nintendo is white-hot right now.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.540]   The 3DS or the old 3D?
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.540]   The old one.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.180]   But they haven't even seen the 3D, but if that holds true, the 3D is going to be used
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.500]   in high school as well.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.180]   But they use it for chatting back and forth and playing games with each other.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.180]   Really?
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.180]   That's interesting.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.860]   I wonder if it's because the Nintendo's aren't banned the way the cell phones are.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.860]   I think it's exactly what it is.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.860]   Or in the corner.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.860]   The game is less expensive.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.340]   I have the feeling they're banned.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.860]   Petaluma doesn't ban cell phones.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.860]   They don't?
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.940]   No, he takes his iPhone every day to school.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.940]   My kid takes his to school.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.940]   It depends on the age.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.180]   You can't keep kids from bringing cell phones because parents get pissed off because they
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.180]   can't call their kids.
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:09.020]   By the way, somebody told me some research that 6-year-olds are getting cell phones
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.420]   out, especially in divorced families because that way they don't have to talk to the other
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.180]   parent to get to the kid.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.180]   They can just call a kid.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.180]   Oh, geez.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.180]   That's brilliant.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.180]   I'm down for that.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.060]   As a parent of a 7-year-old, I would totally, if I just had extra money laying around, hook
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.580]   her up with the cell phone.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.580]   There are kids cell phones.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.220]   I gave Henry a kid cell phone.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.900]   He promptly left it in his pocket and made sure it got washed.
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.900]   Oh my goodness.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.340]   We're getting out in the weeds here, but a friend of mine's child is also 7 like my
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.340]   own.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.940]   He came to me with his iPad the other day and said, "Hey, my dad said I could download
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.900]   Skype.
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.900]   Can you help me set it up?"
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.900]   I said, "Okay."
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.060]   I set him up on Skype and, "What a disaster."
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.020]   All of a sudden, this kid has a cell phone in his hand where he otherwise would.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.020]   He didn't be allowed to have one.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.020]   Interesting.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.740]   Yeah, I got in trouble.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.100]   I put chat roulette on the friends.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.100]   Oh, did that?
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.100]   No, I didn't.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.100]   I'm just kidding.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.100]   I'm just kidding.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.340]   Although, that's what people are saying.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.460]   That color application is just basically a chat roulette with strangers.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.020]   Can we talk about color?
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.620]   Yeah, this was the one that came out last week.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.620]   Hold on.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.540]   Robert's pulling in the shelf together.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.660]   But no, we're not in the same room, so it won't work.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.260]   We're 116 kilometers away, so color won't work.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.980]   That's okay, even when we are in the same room, nobody watches it.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.820]   It's an iPhone app that you take pictures with and it shows you pictures that other people
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.820]   in your vicinity have taken pictures.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.780]   I think it uses the Wi-Fi or the Bluetooth.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.780]   I'm not sure which.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.660]   Maybe it uses 3G.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.300]   So it's strangers.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.380]   The problem is most of the time nobody else is using it, so it's just you.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.660]   I was driving through Silicon Valley yesterday, trying it, and did not get one single hit.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.620]   And I mean, obviously it's new, but...
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.620]   No, it's just...
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:59.260]   But the thing, the reason it incenses people is because they raised $41 million.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.740]   Well, here I actually interviewed them on Thursday and I'm curious what you think.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.740]   I'm curious what you think.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.740]   How it works.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.060]   It has to be in the same room almost as somebody else who's using color.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.300]   It uses the compass to know where your camera's shooting.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.300]   Oh, it does.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.300]   It actually is listening to the audio.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.260]   It's not recording the audio, but it's recording a fingerprint of the audio signature of the
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.260]   room.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.260]   What?
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.260]   So you can tell...
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.260]   Yeah, here's why they're doing that.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.540]   He says what we're trying to do is make it possible for a lot of people to go to, let's
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.860]   say, a Lady Gaga concert and all be shooting pictures.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.940]   We'll know where the performer is because everybody's aiming at the same place.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.540]   And we're listening to the audio signature of the room to join everybody into one color
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.740]   space.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:47.100]   And they expect to be able to show you live the closest picture that's being taken of
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.100]   that event.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.780]   So if somebody's in the front row, the people in the back row will see pictures that the
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.180]   front row is shooting.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.740]   What do you think of the argument that that is all a red herring and that really the reason
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:05.140]   they got $41 million is because they figured out a way to collect all sorts of info.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.540]   It really scares me that they got the mic on.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.020]   All sorts of information about their users, which they'll be able to sell.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:18.020]   I mean, there's no sense in the $41 million unless you assume they're up to something
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.980]   clever.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.660]   We talked about that a lot.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.860]   They got their money for a couple reasons.
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.380]   Well, it's a superstar team.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.620]   And I remember friend feed for $50 million.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.260]   The guys who started Color started La La.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.420]   It's a superstar team.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.300]   They built already a good team.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.860]   And that got them a call from Sequoia.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.580]   Sequoia came to them, actually.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.900]   But they are building a new kind of social graph.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.860]   If I actually am in the room with you and shooting pictures, it joins us.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.420]   It knows that we have something in common at that point in time.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.620]   And then from then on, in fact, on my phone, you can see other people who've shot pictures.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.020]   These are so people I've collected by going around Silicon Valley and going to various
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.140]   parties and things.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.980]   So it's a little bit out of focus to us.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.580]   I'm assuming those are all half naked people.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.820]   Yeah, there's a lot of--
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.340]   --like baby photos, other people, babies photos.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.500]   I have to tell you, as soon as I thought about it for half a minute, I erased Color
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.020]   immediately.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.700]   And I would recommend anybody who listens to the show immediately race that.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.180]   Nobody under 25 will hear that advice.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:27.420]   Because now that I know that it's also doing sound analysis, that really creeps me out.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.780]   And this is a real flaw in Apple's permissions system.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.380]   At no point were we informed that this program was turning on the microphone.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.820]   I don't care if they say they're not using it.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.340]   They're turning on the microphone on my phone and they never told me that.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.340]   That's bad news.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.180]   Well, they told you on my show on three things.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.660]   They didn't tell me that when I downloaded the Grey's Anatomy iPad app.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.660]   What?
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.660]   It listens to you too.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.900]   It listens to the TV to figure out where it is in the show so that it can sync its
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.460]   simulcast of iPad information to where you are in the show.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.460]   That sounds cool, actually.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.700]   I kind of like that.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.980]   I used it once it didn't speak to me, but it has the same functionality.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.140]   It's basically using it as a geolocator or triangulator in this case.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.140]   That's interesting.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:18.180]   But again, this strikes me as something really wrong with the iPhone that the only people
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.380]   who know this and can give permission are Apple themselves.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.260]   They decide, presumably they know, but there's nowhere when you download this app that it
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.100]   tells you, oh, by the way, we're going to turn on the microphone.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.700]   This is the flip side of the curated garden that they have at Apple versus the Android
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.700]   free range market.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:42.020]   I would love to see the big debate is, of course, you know, Android is a crappier web
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.940]   store than iTunes is, but I prefer to think of Android as a shopping mall, or there could
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.020]   be a whole bunch of individual curated store experiences.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.980]   As Amazon is, in fact, shown.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.980]   Exactly.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:54.980]   It's on Android as well.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.660]   Yeah, you know, and I'm actually going to download it now and see if it tells me that
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.900]   the microphone is turned on.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.100]   Do they turn it on in the Android phone as well?
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.780]   They're using all the sensors in the device to make a new kind of experience.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.820]   Well, presumably, I mean, one of those paranoid because, you know, first of all, no one's
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.820]   using this.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:16.140]   Second of all, once you start seeing how it's working, you're realizing it's studying stuff
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.660]   about you that you might not have thought about before it.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.540]   It's doing stuff that Instagram or pick, please, is not doing.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.100]   The first thing it does is ask you what's that?
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.540]   The first thing it does is ask you for your name in a picture.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.740]   It doesn't tell you what it's going to do with any of it.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.980]   I'm not crazy about the whole thing.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.940]   Well, I think the biggest question is, is the premise good enough for all the high--
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.940]   It's not.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.260]   And that's the other issue is no.
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260]   But that's why I think that there's more to this than meets the eye.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.020]   Otherwise, what's the business model?
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.820]   Well, Robert, you had such a great post about this that you were excited about it, and,
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   you know, everybody--
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.820]   Oh, no, even it.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.140]   When I first got it, I really had a bad first experience, and that's why I got rated
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.580]   two stars in the store, because if you're not with somebody else, it doesn't do anything.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.580]   Right.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.340]   And also, the UI is goofy, and the guys who started to admit, they really blew the UI.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.500]   They tried to make it too simplistic, and it's just too hard to figure out.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.180]   In this world, you don't get a second chance.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.780]   They've pushed a new version of it, but I don't think it matters.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.780]   It's done.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.540]   $41 million down the tube.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.540]   Thank you, Sequoia.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.220]   That's the problem with having that much superstar attention, is if you don't get it right, the
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.980]   day you open the gate, you're tough.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.980]   Yeah, you're dead meat.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.180]   And we're into this area with mobile apps that they don't necessarily have to have privacy
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.180]   policies.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.180]   Apparently not.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:38.340]   Yeah, so whereas Google gets these bi-annual reviews now as the result of buzz, there's
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:45.060]   really nothing, you know, to clamp in on as they're having done something wrong here,
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.220]   because the law is still in such flux as to what mobile applications have to do.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.940]   Does it scare anybody that-- now we've learned that this program turned on the money.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.380]   Some microphone and was listening now.
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.500]   They're not losing it in any nefarious way, but they didn't have to tell us.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   They just did it.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.020]   Doesn't it mean that there may be many other apps that are doing the same thing?
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.020]   Doesn't that bother anybody?
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.500]   I mean, yes and no.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.780]   It's one of those things where the mere fact that we're talking about it now on a very
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.500]   large platform is what keeps me from--
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.060]   Thanks to Robert who found out.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.060]   Of course, but there's always--
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.340]   There's always not the only app that uses the microphone.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.740]   A shop kick uses the microphone to know whether you've entered the store.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:25.700]   You turn on shop kick and it's actually listening for an inaudible signal that they put in
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.540]   the front of, let's say, Macy's.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:33.460]   So they have a speaker in front of inside Macy's that when you take your iPhone inside Macy's
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.180]   inside the front door, it senses the audio signal that's inside and gives you points
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.220]   for entering the store.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.860]   And that's one.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:48.740]   The other app that uses the microphone is Intune Now, which does what Denise says.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.900]   It listens to your TV programs that you're actually watching.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.900]   Thank you, Seth.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.020]   And this is a new app coming out of a company in Palo Alto.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.460]   And it listens to the TV signal.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.180]   For five years, they've been recording 148 channels of TV.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:08.060]   So CNN, ABC, NBC, Discovery Channel, et cetera.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:14.180]   And they have a way for it to look at the audio footprint of any minute of TV or any
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:19.980]   12 seconds of TV and tell you what you're watching, where in the show you're actually
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:20.980]   watching.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:21.980]   And that's pretty interesting.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.220]   And then it shares that.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.540]   So it checks you into the TV show like four squared as and builds a feed.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.700]   So you can see a feed here of all my friends and what they're actually watching on TV.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.580]   The difference there, at least they're saying this is what we do.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.580]   I mean, color didn't.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.140]   Well, it's pretty obvious what it's doing.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.140]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.140]   Color.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.140]   Does it have bother you, Brian, as a libertarian?
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.740]   I mean, talk about invasion of privacy.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.740]   I guess the libertarian would worry if the government would go.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   Right, correct.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.740]   The government has nothing to do with this.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.300]   This is, to be honest, I think in the free marketplace of ideas, what happens is, is
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:56.300]   somebody has an unfair policy and it's an individual business that is too intrusive.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:01.380]   A show like this talks about it, word spreads around the campfire, and either people decide
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.580]   they don't care and they accept it, in which case that's fair too, or they decide that's
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.300]   not cool and color has to change it or they go out of business.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.580]   And it's just a good morning.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.580]   But wait a minute.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:17.860]   Only if color tells people, now look at the color privacy policy at color.com/privacy.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:18.940]   Here's what we collect.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:24.140]   But there's a profit motive for people like us to try to find them with the gotcha.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.780]   How would you know that this application, even because they don't, by the way, say that
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.980]   they're collecting audio, how would you know?
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.860]   I don't believe Robert Scobull, the way they're building a, the way they've termed it is
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.860]   they're building a fingerprint of that moment in time of the audio in the room.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.540]   So they're not recording the audio, they're not listening to audio, there's no audio file
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.820]   being transmitted up to their service, but they're recording the waveform of the audio
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.380]   and building a fingerprint out of it.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.620]   And that's sort of how this new into now app works.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.540]   They actually didn't record the audio of the TV shows.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.540]   They recorded some sort of--
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.540]   Right, I understand they're fingerprinted.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.540]   I understand that.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.540]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.780]   And so they can't, you can't listen to them.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.860]   Here's what we collect when you download and use our app.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.300]   We collect the name you give us.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.180]   We collect your email address.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.900]   We collect the unique identifier on your device.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.300]   It's shared for advertising purposes.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.460]   We collect pictures, videos, comments, and actions you take through the app.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.460]   Hold on, I'll use the--
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.460]   Wait for me to over on your location.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.260]   You skipped over the line where it says we store, but do not share this information.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.260]   Contact information unless a court requires us to do this.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.740]   I'm not worried about the contact information.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.900]   Yeah, but you totally skip over that part though.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.100]   You're editing on the fly before getting an--
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.100]   I don't know.
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.420]   Okay, fine.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.660]   I don't care about my email address, I give that on all the time.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.460]   I care about the unique identifier on my device, which is all they say is not used to contact
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.460]   you.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.460]   They exactly do not say we don't share it.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.580]   They say it's shared.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.420]   We collect pictures, videos, comments, and actions, and we share that.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.420]   So good.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.580]   They don't share my email address.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.900]   They just share everything else.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.900]   Well, yeah.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.740]   Right, but Leo, you found this on the web, right?
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.740]   This is a mobile app.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.740]   Oh.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.740]   Where are you going to find this?
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.740]   Good point.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.940]   And you've downloaded it from the app store.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.940]   Has anybody ever read?
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.940]   It's not taken you through.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:14.100]   It's not taken you through a series of hoops that makes you agree or say you've read it
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.220]   or put in a CAPSHA or anything that indicates that you've actually groched this app.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.540]   So what's the law, Anastinies?
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.060]   I mean, is this allowed?
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.580]   In the mobile space, it's wide open.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:31.300]   There's-- California tends to be the reigning in of the folks in the web space because we
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:37.340]   have this very restrictive law as to what websites have to do as far as privacy goes.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.700]   So everyone sorts of ramps up to be able to do business in California.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.940]   I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.260]   By the way, the legal agreement is inside the iTunes.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.900]   What you download it, it's at the bottom.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.820]   There's a link with the license agreement.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.820]   So you are right.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.820]   Good, right?
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.820]   It's pretty lengthy.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.140]   Does it say that they're recording your audio because that's illegal?
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.620]   It's not recording the audio.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.380]   And that's the bigger question.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.380]   I don't know.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.420]   Well, wait a minute, Robert, it is recording the audio because otherwise, how would they--
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.860]   They're sending it back to the server.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.420]   They can't be doing that in the phone.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.100]   It's not the audio.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.060]   It's recording the waveform of the audio.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.940]   It's the way that they turned it.
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.100]   They made it very clear they're not recording a wavefile that you can listen to.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.100]   Look at Robert.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.620]   It's recording a digital waveform of the--
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.580]   Robert, they're recording the audio and sending it back to their servers where the audio
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.100]   from everybody else is compared so they know you're in the same room.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.660]   It's different though because if this audio is being recorded, right, you can actually
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.900]   understand it on the other end.
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.900]   No, let me tell you.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.220]   I'll tell you a little hack that just-- we were talking about on security now.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:47.940]   If people who use VoIP telephony with variable bit rate encoding, even if they're using a
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:53.460]   VPN tunnel where it's encrypted, these researchers are amazing.
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.700]   Because the size of the packet varies with the variable bit rate encoding, you can actually
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:03.140]   get about 50% of the true speech just by looking at packet sizes.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.740]   So Robert, Robert, they-- okay, they're sending a finger at the bridge.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.860]   The inchu now guys, when I talked with them, they said they actually record most only the
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.620]   base because that's where the really important information is.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.700]   And that's where the information is that has less distortion and less noise from the
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.980]   room because that technology works even if your kids are screaming in the room.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.980]   It's really an interesting technology.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.140]   O'leo's got his face on.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.740]   I'm just saying if you're hearing all this and it doesn't set off alarm bells, you're
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.740]   not paying attention.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.380]   Well, but here's the part that confuses me.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.700]   It's like we're worried about this color app and the fact that it has some poorly worded
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.820]   privacy policy when in fact their end game is to deliver you the right coupon just at
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.620]   the time you want to sign up for Netflix.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.180]   If you want to be worried, you should be worried about the stuff that's in the Patriot
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.180]   Act that's already been announced.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   Oh, I agree.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.780]   So you can turn on your phone and start listening into conversations randomly.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.780]   I agree.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.780]   There's plenty to worry about.
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.780]   I'm not saying that.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.540]   If 27 things Google did this week.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.540]   Exactly.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.580]   But it's like if your aim is you're worried about privacy, I feel like this is a lot of
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.580]   it.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.460]   You actually do harm your cause by focusing on such a minor.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.980]   This is this is a nothing app.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.300]   It's a tiny app and a tiny in a giant store.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.900]   There are so many bigger players out there.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.740]   If you want to get all worried about privacy.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.460]   But I really are you kidding me?
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.300]   Well, no, I mean, what are they going to do with this?
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   Right.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.540]   That we should be warned that the microphone's being used.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.500]   You know, how it's being used and what's being stored and what turns out the other end, you
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.460]   know, can can that audio be decompressed and listened to by a government agency that can
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.460]   mean?
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.940]   Meanwhile, a government agency, the FTC, decided that Google gets 20 years of oversight because
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.700]   of buzz, which seems to me a little draconian.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.300]   But maybe Denise, you can comment on that.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.540]   Is that an unusual amount of time for government oversight?
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.940]   Back up is what an unusual amount of time.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.940]   Okay.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.300]   I was toning in on the really cogent remark from the chat room that we should just make
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.220]   opt in a law and be done with it because.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.540]   Well, that's true.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.020]   If people read it.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.020]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.020]   So, so backup for me.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.060]   So you remember when Google announced and launched Google Buzz?
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.060]   That's so.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.060]   They put out that you were there.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.060]   We skipped over to that.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.060]   I jumped ahead.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:25.340]   So, so is the two year biannual review and unusual amount of time for the next 20 years,
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.220]   which in Google time is, well, I mean, that's forever.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.780]   This whole thing is really unusual.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:37.460]   I mean, for them to have come to this accommodation with the FTC as opposed to some more severe,
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:43.180]   you know, a two year biannual review is not, is not that big a deal, you know, presumably
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.780]   they should be able to pass that with flying colors.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:51.100]   And what they got in trouble for was breaching their privacy policy, right?
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.980]   So, you know, all that's going to be reviewed is their policies and are you complying with
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.980]   them?
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.620]   Well, yeah, we are now, you know, now that we've left on the wrist, it's a slap on the
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.620]   wrist.
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.620]   I think so.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.620]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.620]   I mean, is it, is it even worse?
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.620]   Could have been a lot worse.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.660]   In fact, I would, I would submit the Google probably embraces this because they'd love to
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.900]   reassure people that they are getting a biannual review on their policy.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.900]   Well, and that's the thing.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.060]   If you read the Google blog, it really does sound like so it almost vaguely sounds like
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.060]   it was their idea.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.060]   Let me see if I can actually find it.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.860]   We've got the JD powers, FTC seal of privacy.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.860]   Exactly.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.860]   That's kind of what it is.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.420]   It's just like, you know, we love you and we love your privacy.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.420]   So guess what?
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.420]   We've arranged.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.180]   We got the privacy police going to check on you every couple of years.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.180]   Aren't we great?
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.180]   Buy more stuff.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.340]   Yeah, we won't be driving by your house with our big wife.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.900]   I love her anymore because a big brother FTC is watching us like a hawk every two years.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.900]   Are you freaking kidding me?
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.220]   So, so Brian, I guess I agree with you.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.940]   There are plenty of things to worry about.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.260]   Color is just one of many.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.260]   Well, yeah.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.340]   And it's one of those, you know, it's the latest thing and it's tempting to get all,
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.340]   you know, hyped up about it.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:02.340]   But, you know, I think as far as what's more important, you know, an opt-in app that allows
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.820]   you to stream, you know, take pictures of it.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.300]   Here's why I think it's important because we all are carrying these in our pockets all
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   the time.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:13.380]   And if this becomes a device that can be turned on at will for audio, pictures, location
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.500]   by purchasing history.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.500]   Yeah, this becomes the most, I mean, already is.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.700]   And I think this is the difference between you and me.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.020]   I'm more scared of the government being able to do all that, which it can right now.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.020]   And you're more scared of businesses being able to do that.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.980]   Yeah, you're more scared of government.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.020]   I'm not so scared of government.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:36.740]   I don't think businesses, the problem with the business is the corporation has no morality.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.660]   Corporation has one duty, which is to maximize profits.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.660]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.660]   Which means that-
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:46.380]   I think we and our elected representatives have more control over businesses.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.420]   You know, we can make some statements and have some standards in place.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.660]   Meanwhile, I don't believe that as long as we have a two party government.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.660]   He hates government.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.940]   As long as it's the crypts and the bloods, you're still voting for a gangster every year.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.500]   Basically, we're screwed.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.500]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.860]   Just from both sides, basically.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.860]   You know what?
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.700]   As soon as I can afford to see stead, I'm going to move out to the Pacific Ocean and open
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.700]   a casino.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.340]   You and me will be amazing on your boat.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.100]   Let's talk about casinos though.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.020]   In fact, I don't have one here.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:19.420]   But they're putting microchips into the playing cards so they can sense whether you're stealing
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.980]   an ace off the table.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.380]   If you're going to a casino, you're giving up all rights anyway.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.500]   As I learned when we tried to bring a video camera into the-
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.620]   One of these days, I got to tell you that there was an epic story I've only told once
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.620]   online.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.860]   I don't think I can get away with doing it now.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.780]   But there was an amazing night that I found myself full on cheating in Las Vegas.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.140]   We'll talk about that.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.780]   And it was terrifying and awesome.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.380]   The amazing membrane separating business and government has been permeated.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.940]   Robert Gibbs goes to Facebook.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940]   It does.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.940]   Googles.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:50.940]   Eric Schmidt, go to commerce.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.940]   I'll Google it.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.940]   Let me find out.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.940]   Would you Google that?
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:54.940]   Find out.
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940]   Is Eric Schmidt going to Congress?
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.980]   You'll find out about our amazing is blank, blank, blank Google threads.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.980]   That meme is going to-
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.740]   That meme is going to eat me alive.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.300]   But meanwhile, before we do that, let's take a little break.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.140]   You guys smoke them if you got them.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.300]   The smoking lamp is on.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.300]   I should have this smoke.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   What do you mean-
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.980]   I've got to decide if I want to do a bio break or not.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:15.980]   You've got time.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:16.980]   I'm going to talk about go to meeting.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.980]   You don't care about that.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.300]   No, I mean, I just don't have a good story for go to meeting.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.700]   He's saving it up for the audible.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.540]   He's not what you're talking about.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.300]   Save it for the audible, baby.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.060]   I'm talking about go to meeting.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.140]   Go to meeting.com/twix funny, Brian.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.460]   You can duck, but your hair goes right through the camera.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.460]   Go to-
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.300]   He ducks under the camera.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.100]   But the little spikes just go right.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.820]   This is the best way to meet online.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.780]   In fact, business travel, as we all know, is just lately worse and worse.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.780]   It's no fun.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.780]   It's stressful.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.780]   And of course, it's hugely expensive.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.500]   It could just kill your profits.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.020]   But you do have to meet with people.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.340]   That's why we revert resorts to the conference call.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.260]   But come on, a conference call.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.140]   You know they're out there playing with their Facebook while they listen to you.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.100]   That's why go to meeting is so great.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.180]   When you hold your meetings online, they're more compelling, more exciting, more interesting.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.940]   In fact, I use go to meeting even if it's just going to be a conference call.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.980]   It's so easy to set up.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.420]   I click a link.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:18.380]   It puts that email out to everybody, giving them all that information.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.780]   By the way, this includes the conference bridge.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.220]   So you get a phone number, the meeting code and all that.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.020]   That's part of the, it's built in free.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.180]   So it sends that all out to them.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.980]   They call in.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.100]   If they don't have the go to meeting software installed, it takes 30 seconds.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.100]   They've got it installed.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.100]   It's secure.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.780]   And then, by the way, if you decide to show them something, you can.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.100]   They've got the window open.
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.020]   They don't even have to make a phone call.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.540]   They have the choice in the go to meeting software.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.780]   It says, would you like to call this number or just press this button.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.700]   We'll use your mic and speakers.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.500]   If you've got an iPad, it works.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.500]   They ask permission.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.100]   What are you laughing at?
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.740]   If you have an iPad, they ask permission.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.740]   I tell you.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.940]   If you have an iPad, it works great.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.300]   Actually, I was, it was kind of cool.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.580]   I was in a go to meeting with my iPad.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.940]   I was sitting out in the backyard here and I could hear and I was like, I put in my headset
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.940]   and it was so cool, I didn't need a phone or anything.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.940]   $49 a month.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.940]   That's it.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.820]   As many meetings as you want as long as you want, it is such great software.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.660]   128-bit SSL.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.580]   If you are doing conference calls, if you are traveling too much and you like to travel
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.220]   less, if you have sales presentations, product demos, training sessions, collaborating on
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.300]   documents, little higher.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.300]   Little higher.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   Right there.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   Little higher.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.300]   There you go.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:37.900]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.340]   It's amazing.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.540]   I think they should pay extra for the Brian hair.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.540]   You know what?
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.540]   We'll work something out.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.540]   Use promo code "BriensHair".
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.620]   See how that works for you.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.620]   You'll get 0% off.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.620]   Oh, oh my goodness.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.100]   Oh my goodness.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.100]   Amazon.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.100]   Yeah, this is huge.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.100]   This is the story.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.660]   Now Denise wanted to say something.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.660]   Go ahead, Denise.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.900]   Oh, I was just going to say I like how Brian's hair is a moving target.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.700]   You're never quite sure what you're going to get.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.700]   It's useful when we start to let things start to get heated.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.100]   You know, we're like, "I believe this.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.100]   I believe that politics.
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.100]   Hey, I have goofy hair."
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.820]   I thought I'd like Dilbert's boss.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.820]   It just got spicier.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.540]   As you got a little test.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.060]   He's not fooling me one for one moment.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.580]   When I get angry, it gets taller.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.580]   Are you in a militia?
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.580]   I know you're in a militia.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.780]   I'm going to buy some guns.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.740]   Guns are all right.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.740]   I live in Texas.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.740]   You love Brian.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.740]   Are you kidding?
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.060]   Brian, you're my only Republican friend.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.060]   I'm not a Republican.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.820]   Oh, I don't call you dirty words.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.220]   What are you doing?
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.220]   Come on.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.620]   All right.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:48.740]   Let me move on to Amazon, which this week made a big play.
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.820]   They basically said, "Yeah, we are here, baby.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.020]   Bring it."
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.980]   So maybe Becky, you can give us a summary of what Amazon announced.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:03.220]   Well, basically what they've done is created a cloud service for your music up to five
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.220]   megabytes free.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.220]   It starts with five gigs.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.220]   Sorry, five gigs.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.220]   Sorry, I'm having a great time.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:13.660]   And then if you buy one Amazon MP3 album, you get 20 for a year, every year.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.380]   We'll pay 20 bucks for that.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.060]   Well, it's weird because it's a buck a gigabyte.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.460]   You can go up to a terabyte, but it's a thousand dollars, which is ridiculous.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.460]   What?
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.740]   The way everything you buy on Amazon, all the music you buy on Amazon doesn't count against
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.740]   your total.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.740]   All right.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.460]   So basically they're saying, "Hey, forget that iTunes thing."
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.220]   You can stream it on your Android device.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.780]   They have a map for that.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.900]   You can download it to as many computers as you want.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.780]   I called Amazon for clarification on that because I thought, "Oh, well, the download,
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   that's kind of crazy.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.900]   That's the big thing that Apple has that five authorized devices."
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.700]   And they said, "No, no, as many devices as you want."
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.700]   It's unprotected.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:35:00.780]   So this is the solution for multiple devices, music everywhere, solidations.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.780]   You know, there's one limit.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.780]   Is this it?
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.420]   The only, it works on Android, it works on their browser.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.340]   It doesn't work on your iPhone or any iOS.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.740]   Except through the browser.
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.740]   It does work in Safari.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.740]   It's not weird, though.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.700]   You only get to play one thing through quick time.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.100]   It's not, you can't have a player.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.140]   You can't create playlists, which you can with the Android app.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.140]   My suspicion is that you will have iOS apps within a few weeks.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.620]   I know the game is against that.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.340]   When you listen to Amazon's position, I mean, basically, they say, the question, of course,
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.940]   is whether or not they need extra licenses to run things this way.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.940]   Right.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.940]   And Sony's not happy.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:28.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.340]   There's spokeswoman said, "We hope they'll reach a license deal, but we're keeping all
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.900]   of our legal options open."
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.940]   So many of the chatter made a good point.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.980]   You can put your iTunes music on as many as iPods or iPhones as you want.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   There's no limit there.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.980]   Right.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   But only five computers.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.940]   Well, at any given time, because once you hit your five, you can scrap all of them and
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.220]   then pick a different five.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   Once a year, you can scrap all of them.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.220]   It's only once a year.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.220]   Okay.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.220]   It's really frustrating.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.220]   You have to deauthorize.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.180]   And if you forget to deauthorize like, you know, you get a word of a computer or you
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.620]   format the drive, you kind of have to write.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.500]   We should just tackle that really quickly.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.100]   Do you think Steve Jobs has music on a bunch of different computers?
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.500]   He's going, "Man, can we consolidate?
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.900]   When can we do this?
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.020]   And have they been afraid of the license question?
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.020]   Is that?"
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.500]   I think it's pretty clear that Apple has planned to announce exactly this.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.460]   They bought Lala, which does this.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:23.660]   They have built this ginormous operations network operations center in North Carolina.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.060]   I think they were going to do this.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.900]   And I think Amazon jumped their announcement.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:32.820]   Now, do you think that Apple has worked with, I assume they have to have been working with
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.980]   the music industry to get licensing, to make sure everything is above board with the music
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.180]   industry used to give Apple a pass, right?
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.500]   That's how Apple got us started.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.580]   And then now Apple's the number one music retailer in the world.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.580]   Bar none.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.580]   Whether it's physical media or digital.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.540]   And the music industry is not going to give them any more free passes.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.580]   They're terrified of Apple, I think.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.500]   Well, when Amazon was asked about the issue of licenses, because obviously if Amazon's
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.900]   just going to offer this service, then why is Google wasting their time trying to put
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.180]   together their music service?
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.460]   We're looking for licenses.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.300]   Same thing for Sony.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:07.020]   According to Amazon, "We do not need a license to store music in a cloud drive.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.460]   The functionality of saving MP3s to cloud drive is the same as if a customer were to
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.540]   save their own music to an external hard drive.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.540]   Hey, big.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.540]   Or even iTunes.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.220]   Here's a different way to look.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.500]   I showed my son this and I said, "Isn't this cool?
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.660]   You can upload all your music."
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.940]   He was like, "Dad, we listen to Pandora in high school now.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:30.780]   It doesn't matter that you can upload your audio and your music to someplace.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.860]   You just go to Pandora and type in your artist name and it starts playing."
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.860]   There's a difference.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.860]   Because Pandora, you don't get to choose a song.
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:36.860]   Way less.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   This is all about that.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.860]   Yes.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.860]   Specific songs.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.540]   Now Denise, Amazon says you don't need a license.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.380]   That's not what the music industry says.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.380]   That's right.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.180]   Amazon has stepped into this legal morass that's been going on.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:52.900]   Did you guys see the Hulu April Fool's joke where they put you back to the late 90s?
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:53.900]   Yes.
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:38:01.660]   They stepped right back into that time zone when they decided to do this because Michael
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.260]   Robertson, who Leo, you should have on Prime League 3.com.
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.260]   MP3LIP3.com.
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:10.960]   He's the one who promised the, was it the democratization of Rockstar basically, the middle class
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.960]   Rockstar?
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.960]   Yes.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.320]   The first on your list is a triangulation guest, please.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   He's been really good.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   I'm sure he is, yes.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   He is a pair.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   He is now.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.280]   He's a really interesting fellow and he's been at this since the late 90s when his first
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:30.680]   company MP3.com got sued into non-existence with the then largest copyright verdict ever
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.200]   awarded hundreds of millions of dollars, which has been blown past now.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:41.960]   Anyway, they were trying to do this, what seems like a totally common sensical thing
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.560]   that you've bought it.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.880]   You should be able to time and place and device shift it to your heart's content, but the
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   content industry has never bought into this.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.720]   And as Robertson points out, the law has nothing to do with common sense.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   Right.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   It's the law.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.720]   Whatever the law is.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.720]   But have we, do we have a law?
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.720]   Do we have?
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.280]   Has there ever been any decision on this?
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.440]   There have been decisions along the way that are sort of incremental and I've seen the Wall
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.480]   Street Journal and other people say, oh, well, the fact that the Supreme Court didn't step
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:16.560]   into the cable vision decision, which came out a while ago, you guys probably remember,
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.920]   in 2009, the Supreme Court decided we're not going to touch that cable vision if they have
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.040]   these remote DVR facilities.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:31.560]   We're going to let that happen because really it's just, it's not, it's the users making
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.960]   a copy on their own local space, which we know they can do under the Betamax decision
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.680]   from so long ago.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:46.400]   And, you know, all that cable vision is doing is providing some sort of remote backup of
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.440]   that and it's really just the users making the copies.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.880]   This is a little different, right?
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.680]   I mean, we've been talking about here you have a locker, you have a drive where you can
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.480]   upload stuff that you have downloaded from Amazon, you can upload whatever's on your
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.480]   computer.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.520]   It's like when you first open iTunes and it does a scan and it says, can we see what
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.040]   MP3s you have and we'll add it to the iTunes library?
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.400]   It's the same thing, they're going to add it to the Amazon's app.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.400]   And now the copy.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   As the drop servers.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   It just drop box.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.400]   What's the big deal?
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.680]   Well, and as I understand it, part of the reason that they shut down mp3.com because
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   it was a very sensible thing.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.000]   This is a time when a lot of people were still on dial up and they said, you know, we've
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.200]   talked about this before, but instead of actually uploading and encoding your CD and spending
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.320]   hours to upload it, why don't you just put it in?
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.160]   We'll look at the red book, red book audio tag on there.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.760]   And you're like, oh, you've got that disc when I have access to those.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.200]   Part of the problem, as I remember it, has been over a decade now, was it's like, yeah,
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.160]   but you are, that's not theirs.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.160]   They did not encode it.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   You did not upload it.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   You're just giving them your files and that's illegal.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   Whereas this is different.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.160]   This is a case where it really is grabbing the files and uploading them.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   And is that correct?
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.480]   Or is that the distinction that makes us okay?
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:59.840]   No, because the users, you have to remember that the whole digital music arena is governed
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.920]   by the licenses that apply when you download those things.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.440]   Unless you've gotten them off of some P2P file sharing service, right?
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.160]   Oh, well, then I'm in the clear.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:15.560]   If you've gotten them legally, then you're hemmed in by all the licensing around that
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   file.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.440]   If you've gotten them illegally, well, then, you know, you're already safe.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.280]   So what did the license to say?
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.760]   Do they say you can't do this?
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.880]   No, that's the fascinating thing.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   Amazon.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:34.240]   I was really thrilled to look into this and see that Amazon has gone out on a limb with
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.080]   its own MP3 download service.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:42.120]   It's telling people, and for everyone listening to this show, you're all going to say, duh.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.800]   Well, of course we can do this.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.600]   But the law doesn't agree with you necessarily.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.720]   And the entertainment industry certainly doesn't agree that you can copy, store, transfer
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.960]   and burn for personal entertainment, non-commercial use.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.920]   Everything that you download from something like Amazon's MP3 music service or iTunes.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.520]   iTunes has very different terms, by the way.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.200]   They don't tell you that you can copy, store, transfer and burn.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:12.720]   But Amazon does, which I thought was really interesting.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.520]   These terms of service aren't that old.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.400]   They might have been drafted with this kind of service in mind.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.960]   Yeah, we're going to go ahead and let people start.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   It's the music industry changing it's just because-
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.960]   It's the music industry changing it's just because-
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:29.240]   Did ESA, you live down there with the music industry, are they changing their stance because
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.640]   of the proliferation of these streaming services now?
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.720]   Because Spotify over in Europe, you just type in a song name and it starts playing.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.960]   Well, all of these MOG, Rario, the Rhapsody, they're all licensed, right?
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.520]   Right, and that's streaming.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.400]   That's streaming, that's not storage.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.720]   Yeah, we're talking about a user downloads for their own.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.640]   But they know that's where the world is moving.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.080]   And I think they're starting to change their-
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.640]   If I was in the music industry, I would start changing my legal stance on this stuff because
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.400]   I know kids of the future, kids today are streaming.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.200]   They're not downloading anymore.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.520]   They're not- My son is not stealing-
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.560]   Although, Robert, all of these services like RDO MOG and I think Spotify, I haven't used
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.400]   it because it's in Europe only, allow you to download copies to your device, don't
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   think.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.040]   Our local copies, you just have to validate that you have a license for it once a month
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.760]   because you have to keep paying the 10 bucks a month.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.960]   Battery, if you're paying the 10 bucks.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.480]   Yeah, so in other words, you do have a physical copy on-
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.640]   Well, I don't know if that's physical, but you have a copy on your device.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.840]   It strikes me that Apple actually knew what it was doing and they were just playing a
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:42.000]   little game of chicken with Amazon and Amazon blinked, launched this service and now Steve
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   sitting back saying, "Let's see how that works out."
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.280]   This kind of reminds me of the UN.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.840]   We have to go in there and we have to- Somebody has to go in there and make the first salvo
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   against Gaddafi.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   Who's it gonna be?
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.840]   Arab League says, "We'll do it, we'll do it."
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.840]   Come on, everybody, follow me.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.800]   So the US goes, "Yeah!"
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   And then-
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   Sorry, go back.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:08.960]   I mean, as a consumer advocate, what I'm hoping is that Amazon has done this and either
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.240]   it's, as you said, Leo, this is what I think is the worst-case scenario that Apple goes
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240]   fine.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.240]   Jeff, you fight this battle.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.520]   I don't want to deal with this.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.040]   I got too much stuff.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.320]   But as a consumer advocate, what I'm really hoping is that Google and Apple just speed
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.400]   up their timetables and go, "Fine, we're all in.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.320]   Let's all get in tomorrow and- Oh, wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.320]   Take us on.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.320]   Come on.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   Yeah, we're all in.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.800]   Could this be a case where Amazon is doing something to bust out of its second or third
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:38.000]   place because it's trying again and, of course, it's second place in music, I assume,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   in digital.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   I know it's way behind Apple.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   And of course it's- It's Walmart's second place.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.280]   Okay, so it's the third place, right?
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   So, you're selecting on online video.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.240]   You know, you got your Netflix near Hulu and then Amazon is in third place in here.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.720]   Maybe this is a way where they can try to get a first-mover advantage to change the rules
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.520]   or shake up the landscape to get a better position both for their music and for their
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.520]   video.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   Well, look what Amazon's doing.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.000]   With the Amazon Prime with streaming, they're going after Netflix.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.880]   They're going after Apple on the music front.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.240]   I mean, Amazon is- They're going after publishers.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.240]   They're saying, you know, with the Kindle, I think they're going to do an Android application.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.400]   They're going after Google with the Android marketplace.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.160]   I mean, Amazon is moving on all fronts at this point.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.520]   So what's interesting is, again, Michael Robertson, he's now at MP3Tunes, which does
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.720]   a very similar thing and he had an interesting quote in an era's technical article.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.640]   He says, "Unlike us, Amazon is also a music retailer.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   This means they've entered into a license with all the major record labels to sell music,
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.800]   but these licenses have specific restrictions, things Amazon can and can't do and things
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.560]   they've agreed they won't do.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.920]   So maybe it's kind of a moot point whether it's illegal what they're doing.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.240]   It's certainly a violation of their current licenses and it could screw up their ability
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.240]   to sell music."
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.120]   And Reuters said that Amazon only informed the labels a week prior to the announcement
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.640]   that this is what they were doing.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.280]   And one of the people who was quoted in this Reuters article said, "I've never seen a
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:59.760]   company of this size make an announcement, launch it, and then figure it, say we're going
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.800]   to figure out this stuff on the back end."
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.920]   Google did that with the Google Books search.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.880]   They said, "We'll scan the books.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.480]   We'll figure out the rights later."
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   Right.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.880]   That's a way that works, right?
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.520]   Because they get known by us as a first mover.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.960]   And so what if they have to pay out a billion or two later on?
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.440]   It's a good market strategy, isn't it?
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.160]   I mean, is this a case where finally Amazon is doing what we've all wanted or what all
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.160]   of us thought was common sense for the longest time and they're pushing the issue?
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.600]   Maybe they have the money to spend on it.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.080]   Maybe they stand to gain market shares as a result of the publicity or of changing the
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   landscape.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.200]   I mean, regardless, it's like, I don't care if this is legal or not, like good for them.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.400]   I mean, push the envelope on this.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   Ridiculous laws.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.960]   They have nothing to do with common sense.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.200]   And it also goes back to what the fundamental ethos of all these different companies are.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.120]   I mean, Apple always says, "We're a design company.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.120]   We make hardware."
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.640]   You know, Google has always been about information.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.800]   Well, Amazon has always been about the consumer.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.080]   Amazon has always been trying to sell.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.280]   And this is fundamentally benefiting the consumer.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   It's in their best interest.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   We want it.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   We want it.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.160]   So they have two ways of protecting themselves legally here.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.920]   And they're covering themselves on both fronts.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:13.000]   As we talked about the terms of use for their own music download service and how they're
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.480]   going out on the limb there and saying affirmatively that users have these various rights that
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.800]   the music industry doesn't necessarily or has not historically ever agreed with.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.240]   But then they also have you signed up for this service yet?
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   Have you gone through the process?
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.160]   Have you noticed that it's quite a process to...
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.400]   First, you have to log into your account.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.240]   And you're presented with the terms of service.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.440]   And it's not just something that's lurking around on the bottom of the webpage.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.720]   Oh, there are some terms of service.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.320]   No, you have to read them.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.320]   You have to click OK.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.320]   I've read them.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.160]   And then there's a CAPTCHA that says, "Yes, I've read them."
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:54.120]   And here's a CAPTCHA confirming that I am a human being and I have read these and I agree.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.960]   I didn't let my bot read this.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.960]   This I read this.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   And when you go and you actually read the terms of service, there are all kinds of representations
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.520]   when you sign up for the cloud drive and the cloud player that you are only going to use
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.160]   them for your own personal use.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.320]   You're not going to share.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.320]   You are not going to...
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.880]   That everything that you upload, you have the rights to upload.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:21.240]   They are all legally your own designated file that you can go ahead and do what you will
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.240]   with.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.240]   I also...
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.360]   So they are trying to cover themselves on two fronts.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.400]   Let me point out that it isn't just music when you go to your cloud drive.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.280]   There are pre-made folders for documents, music, pictures and videos.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.040]   I mean, this is a storage...
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   It's Dropbox.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:38.000]   Well, it's Dropbox without the clients, but how long before we get clients?
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.440]   That's just a question right in a little software, right?
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.600]   And so that's an interesting business.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:47.320]   It seems to me that the business model here is we give away this free service, we get
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:52.200]   everybody's store stuff here and oh, by the way, if you keep buying albums from us, we
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.760]   won't charge you.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:59.120]   Do you think that 20 gigs of free space to anyone who buys a single MP3 is in some way
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:03.840]   a bribe to convert their entire user base into an army of evangelists for this service?
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.480]   I mean, it's like, how hard will it be?
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.040]   It's like Amazon Prime, isn't that what Amazon Prime is all about?
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.040]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.880]   I have to say, I'm rooting for Amazon.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.240]   I don't know why.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.600]   It's just that goodwill thing, but I just feel like, "Good, go for it, Jeff.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   I like you.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   Get down."
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   Yep.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   "But your bad self."
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:27.040]   So, Denise, if you were a betting gal, how do you think this is going to shake out?
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.280]   I'm betting that there's going to be litigation about this.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.280]   I bet you're right.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.200]   You can't scramble and get something worked out in the meantime.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.240]   I'm also really surprised because there's already litigation about this pending against
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.120]   Michael Robertson's company that are across motions for summary judgment pending.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:47.440]   But Michael Robertson's working Amazon as a whole nother thing.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.040]   It would create a much deeper outcry on our behalf.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.400]   The courts don't care about us out crying.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.080]   That need to at some level.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.080]   Really?
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.480]   I thought they weren't supposed to read the papers or anything.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   You're supposed to stay ignorant.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   Uh-huh.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   No, the court was thinking kids.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   Uh-huh.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:12.680]   When they're kids, when they go home and their kids are bothering them, they don't
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   want to get a lot.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.680]   Daddy!
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.680]   Why do you vote on this thing this way?
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.840]   You know, you know the world has changed.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.280]   And the world has changed in the last five years, but a lot more of our kids are doing
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   this stuff.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.880]   I agree with you, Robert, that it's kind of strange for all of us.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.400]   I mean, we're all above a certain age.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:34.440]   And for us, I guess we can see we've developed these huge libraries of music.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:39.600]   We've been downloading legally over the last several years and would like to be able to
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.080]   move them around more freely.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.600]   So this seems like a big issue to us.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.680]   But to the Pandora and streaming generation, I think, you know, some of this is too little
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   too late.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.600]   I have to say, I used RDO for a while and fell in love with it.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.840]   And then somebody said, "Oh, you should try MOG."
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.240]   And I love MOG, M-O-G dot com, even better.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.080]   Same thing, 10 bucks.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.360]   It's a streaming music.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.920]   You never own the music, right?
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.280]   You pay 10 bucks a month.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.280]   You could play it on anything.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.840]   They've got an iPhone, Android, and web-based players.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.720]   Soon it will work on the Sonos, which is great, because that's what I use for my audio.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.080]   RDO does work.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.600]   But it's got 9 million songs and the 320 kilobits stream.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   So it's--
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   Wow.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:29.160]   And then if you say you wanted to download the connection to the device, you do.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.400]   I have to say, I don't feel like I need to own music anymore.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.840]   I'm with you.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.200]   I haven't bought a song in a long time.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.120]   It's just that obscure stuff is hard.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.120]   That's the one thing that I still purchase, but you got to have sort of--
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.960]   Where do you buy it?
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:44.960]   You know, me I'm weird.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   I like home.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.960]   The piratebay.org.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   Yeah, the piratebay.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:52.400]   I get a special cut of it.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.640]   Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:59.200]   So here's what's great about questions like this is whatever we see shake out in the world
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.840]   of music seems to shake out about seven years later in the world of video.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.280]   So it's interesting that we don't watch what we see.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.280]   Oh, yeah, we're watch what we see.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.280]   That's right.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.120]   And you know the movie industry is watching this with very--
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.520]   Well, I'm hoping that they can jump to the end conclusion faster, because it's boring
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:20.280]   to see them do the same kind of disinformation about pirate and music and the same kind
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:25.640]   of disinformation that the RIA did a decade ago.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.840]   Yeah, times is changing.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   Times is changing.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.320]   And I have to say the music industry is terrified.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.840]   I was-- I don't know if you saw the stubs when I was going to the Ignatian event at
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:42.720]   stubs, I got button hold by a music industry executive who said I had ambushed him on tech
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.720]   TV.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.320]   Wait, this is like five years ago.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.320]   He's still mad.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   And he comes up really.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   And he was still mad.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.320]   Wow.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   Do you remember that, Becky?
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.320]   I don't know if you remember.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   We did a music event.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.320]   It was a town hall.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:59.320]   And we had the guy from-- and was it NWA or public anime?
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.320]   Public anime.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.320]   Chuck D.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.320]   Chuck D.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   Yeah, because he was pushing MP4 before the--
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   He was pushing MP4.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.120]   He was pushing-- but he was also pushing downloadable music.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.800]   He was a big proponent of Napster.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.320]   And we had this guy on-- I don't remember his name from the music industry.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.320]   And I said, well, how's it going for you?
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.320]   That's a hell of an ambush, Leo.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.760]   Well, he said, I still-- you never let me talk.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.840]   And I had-- you'd always go to commercial when it was my turn to defend the music industry.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.840]   And I said, I'm sorry.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:25.840]   I don't remember doing that.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.840]   And you ever watched television before?
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.840]   Right.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.200]   You can speak for 17 minutes in a row, buddy.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   Sorry.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.200]   I mean, only do Leo.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.840]   So I said, but I said, aren't you making more money than ever before?
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.560]   He said, no, we are not.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.240]   And actually, then I went out and looked and it's true that music sales plummeting.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.440]   Well, well, hold on.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.920]   That's counting new sources of revenue.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.320]   Not counting stream being me.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.320]   It's not counting ringtones.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.880]   OK, then you can't-- that's not fair.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.840]   You know, it's like, I'm sorry that you're not selling more pieces of plastic.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.400]   And, you know, boo-hoo.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.120]   You know, meanwhile, if you're making money on ringtones and licensing music--
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.440]   I just saw a stat that says something like 80% of all music is still bought on CV.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:00.240]   But that--
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.240]   Hard to believe.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.240]   Very hard.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.560]   Oh, I better find that.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.840]   Not that it's not true, but I mean, it's just one of those random stat-a-things.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.800]   I mean, did you guys--
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   I do agree that there is some percentage, though.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   I'm not kidding.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   I'm not talking about bad stats.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:17.720]   Did you guys see the IDC numbers on the future of the mobile operating systems?
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.720]   No, absolutely.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.720]   So their estimates in 2015--
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.880]   This is what they make up, though.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.880]   They have no right.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.880]   Right, but this is crazy.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   Android 45%.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:25.880]   Sure.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:30.360]   BlackBerry 13, iOS 15, Windows Phone 7, 21%.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.840]   Now, what do they base that on?
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   They basically did a Swip-a-Lok.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.080]   They're smoking crack.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.120]   Right now, Symbian, all the Nokia phones are 21%.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   Right.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   Oh, they said--
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   They'll get all the Nokia numbers.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   They just didn't--
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.120]   You know what?
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   The Saks swap on the numbers.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   This week in bad stats.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.400]   And this is why you don't listen to analysts when they say stuff like this.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.320]   They charge huge amounts of money to companies for this stupid stuff.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.640]   And I never report these numbers because they're made up.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.920]   This one was one of those that I just went, wow, that is--
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   It's some--
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.120]   It's some dweeb that'll be asking me for a job in four years.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.240]   They're just making this crap up.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.000]   I was just vampered for you while you look for that, sadly.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.640]   Strategy analytics predicts that physical CD sales will decline by nearly a third this
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.160]   year.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.760]   And for the first time, put digital music sales on top.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.520]   Most music is still sold on physical CDs.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.760]   I don't care if that's 51%.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.760]   I'm still amazed.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.360]   I do, if that's--
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.360]   Wow.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.360]   Let me see if I can--
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.360]   That's not a projection either.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.360]   That's a--
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.360]   No, yeah, hard--
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.360]   Yeah, I'll tell you.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.280]   --the stories, though, that iTunes sells more than Walmart does.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.280]   They do.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   But it's just--
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.280]   Sorry by song.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   Individual.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   I mean, in the long run--
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   That would have been--
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.160]   If you include Walmart plus--
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.160]   I don't know, Sam Goody.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.160]   I don't know who still sells Sam Goody.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.160]   Who sells Sam Goody?
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.160]   Amazon YE.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.160]   Best Buy.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.160]   But in terms of number of transactions--
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.160]   And Becky's--
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.160]   Becky's Hawaiian CDs.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   Dot com.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.160]   I'll be registering that now.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.160]   But that's actually a good point.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.160]   If you did it by a number of transactions as opposed to a number of total music, I bet
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.880]   that would be wildly in the digital phase.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:01.800]   Well, and certainly if you found some way to produce metrics on user engagement, I
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.280]   mean, it's just like-- that is where music is alive now is on digital and the idea of--
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:10.840]   I mean, what's funny is like, you know, when it comes to music executives, I remember
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.600]   being in college and buying used CDs.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.880]   I never bought a new CD ever.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.720]   I buy all used CDs, which when I look back on it means that I absolutely never gave a
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.960]   single dollar to any of the artists that made that music.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.560]   Well, you did because you supported the people who then went out and bought new music that
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:25.560]   they could now afford.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.800]   Hypothetically, it's a shame.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.360]   I guess I subsidized the person who bought the original disc.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.560]   I guess I could see that.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   All right.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.200]   But still, I got to imagine that that same level of involvement, people buying stuff
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.240]   online, even at the heavy discount that they're able to get it from Amazon, they got to be
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.320]   doing more for the music.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.480]   There was a fantastic graphic.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.480]   I'll have to look this up.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.480]   You'll have to vamp for me again.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:49.960]   There was a fantastic graphic talking about what it visualized, what artists get paid.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:54.280]   And for an indie artist to make minimum wage per month, they have to sell about 150 physical
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.280]   CDs.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.640]   Now, and then how many 99 cent downloads is much, much bigger?
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.560]   How many albums, much, much bigger?
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:04.920]   Then when you get into streaming on services like, you know, like RDO or Emoji or any of
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:08.960]   those guys, like in order to make the same amount of money for minimum wage, the biggest
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.080]   one at the bottom, depending on, I forget which service was at the bottom of it, was
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:17.040]   1.5 million streams in order to make the same amount of money that if they pressed
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.960]   their own CDs and sold them out of the back of their car.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   Welcome to our world.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   What do you think?
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   What do you think?
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.960]   Absolutely.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.960]   I'm really curious.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.280]   Listen, we've got five really hip people here and one audience member.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:34.320]   How many of you have played a CD in the last, say, months?
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.320]   A physical CD?
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.320]   Oh, I definitely have.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.560]   But then again, that's because like, we had train wreck on NSFW and they gave me the
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.560]   CD.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.560]   So it's in the car.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.560]   Okay.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.560]   And it's just easiest just right there.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:45.560]   By the way, I'm going to post it.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.680]   But you do as a regular point, you never, you never do.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.280]   I mean, I don't pick it up in the living room, but in the car.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.440]   Oh, I put a kid CD in my DVD player to listen to a storybook.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.440]   That was the last time.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.280]   Robert, you ever play CDs?
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   Nope.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   No.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   Here's the visual.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   I just posted it to you in the chat room there.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   Denise, do you?
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   I'm going to show you something that you haven't seen zero.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   No.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.600]   It's next weekend tech now.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.600]   Okay.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.080]   Since you've now talked about video, this is an app called Show You.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.400]   That's not on the market yet.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.400]   It's coming out in a SHOYU.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   Show you.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.400]   For those of you who are not watching, it's Flipboard.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   I mean, we're just listening.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   Flipboard for video.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.600]   No, it's Flipboard for video.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.640]   And you put your Facebook, your Twitter and some other things in here.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:33.720]   And it shows you a grid of a thousand videos that you can fly through and discover.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.120]   What are the things that have been curated for you?
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.120]   What's that?
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.120]   Curation is the key.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.120]   They're curated for you.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.120]   No, this is not curated.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.400]   Well, it is because it's from your Twitter feed or your Facebook feed.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.400]   So it is curated.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.400]   So it is curated.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.400]   It's great.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.000]   And from the service itself, so there's some serendipitous video in here as well.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.200]   And what's really cool is if, let's see, let's find, let me find a good one.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.760]   If you, if you start playing this video.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:01.840]   And so it's a, a MIO.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.200]   I'm not sure if the MIO has the...
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.280]   And this is iPad only show you?
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   But down here...
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.000]   In the meantime, we're all marveling at the thinness of the new iPad.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   It's all thin.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   I would run it.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.680]   Down here, you can play it on your Apple TV through show, airplay.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.840]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.920]   And that is really cool for music and videos.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.360]   There's two apps that I know of that are coming out this week that have this airplay
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:29.880]   technology and bring in videos so you can push spin as it.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:30.880]   Spin as it.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:35.680]   Spin as an app that does that as well, that has airplay built into it so you can find
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.920]   music and videos and play them.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.560]   Here for your delectations as long as we're doing show and tell, is that graphic that
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.560]   you were talking about?
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.480]   Yeah, it's up at informationisbeautiful.net.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.240]   I like, I like visualizations of graphics.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.280]   So selling out how much do music artists earn on online?
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.160]   And keep in mind, I'll be the first to admit this is not entirely fair because they're
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.240]   talking about a self-press CD and then later they compare it to streaming which is...
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.280]   CD album, retail album, album, download as the ball gets bigger, they're making more
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.280]   money.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.240]   No, no, no, I'm sorry, as the ball gets bigger, they're making the same amount of money,
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.400]   but it requires that many more sales.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.880]   This is to make minimum wage $1,160 a month.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:19.760]   So if you want to make minimum wage $1,160 a month, you sell $143, $10 self-press CDs
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.680]   because you get 100% of the profit.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.680]   Right.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:30.000]   So you have to have 85 CD albums or 11,000, one retail albums or 1,229 downloads.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.400]   It goes up for MP3, retail CD, track, download to make a minimum wage as an indie artist via
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.400]   streaming on Rhapsody.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:45.640]   You have to have 849,817 plays to make that money.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   That's the size.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   Keep going.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.640]   Keep going.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.640]   There's more.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.640]   Keep going.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.640]   $2.5 million.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   Keep going.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.280]   To make it on Spotify, it's off.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.960]   You can't fit the ball into the screen.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.200]   Four million plays per month to make minimum wage.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.400]   I almost said minimum wage, which would have been appropriate.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   In other words, yeah.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.640]   But these all these services, well, that's weird because you would think they would,
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.640]   they're being subsidized by the artists obviously right now and by the labels that they can.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.640]   It's radio.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.480]   Are you saying Rebecca Black's making minimum wage?
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.240]   Is she making anything?
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.240]   Probably not.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.480]   I mean, my guess is after the fact, once she hit, you know, 70 million downloads on YouTube,
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.160]   YouTube sends an email saying, hey, you want to be a part of there?
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.560]   You can make money in the future.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.640]   Oh, Charlie, my name is not even her.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.640]   My guess is they don't retroactively write it.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   It's not her.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   It's our music.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.640]   It's not even her.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640]   Although it's a different age now.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.320]   I mean, she now has the ability to profit from ancillary sources.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.320]   She's making money on the ringtones.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.520]   She could do live engagements or whatever.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:47.720]   Millions of people are buying Friday, Friday ringtones.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   You know why?
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.400]   People finally realized ringtones are about annoying your neighbor.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.320]   And what's more annoying than Friday, Friday comes after Thursday.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.720]   I think ringtones are the new coffee table books.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.440]   It happens and you have to talk about it.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.800]   Someone in the chat room claims it's Raven's crop says that she's making $175,000 a month
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.800]   on YouTube.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.800]   Okay, I'll take it.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   Well, wow.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.800]   Did you see the Fallon?
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.800]   Colbert.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   Was that brilliant?
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800]   Friday remake.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.800]   Is that Taylor?
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.800]   Taylor Hicks.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800]   Who is that?
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.800]   Is the guy directed an officer and gentlemen?
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   No, I don't think so.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.720]   Taylor Hicks was an un-American idol.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720]   No.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.440]   What I loved about it and why I'm so glad we're talking about it now is because the entire
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.840]   season that I was watching American Idol when he was on it, I thought that if you took George
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.760]   Clooney and Leo and you had a love child, it would be Taylor Hicks.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760]   I believe that.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.920]   You have to look at a picture of the guy.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.400]   It does kind of look like that.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.400]   I get totally seen that.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.400]   You have a harmonica.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   You have a lot of scratchy energy.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.400]   You have a lot of scratchy energy.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.040]   It's just a gray hair.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.880]   All those gray hair guys look the same.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.920]   It's great for those of us with daddy issues.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   So it's super.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   It's super.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   That is awesome.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:01.920]   Come on.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   Sit in my lap.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   I'd like to tell you a little story about something called Audible.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.920]   Oh, nice segue, daddy.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   Come on, baby.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   Remember when I...
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.920]   You're gonna be a book, Daddy Leo.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   I used to read to you.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.880]   You'd sit in my lap and let's say...
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.040]   Let me tell you a little bit about Harry Potter.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.240]   Actually, I'm a big fan of Audible.com.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.240]   I think you all are.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.640]   I know you are, Brian, because you do a lot of...
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   You travel a lot.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   Traveling all the time.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   Traveling, man.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:31.160]   Audible allows you to download any from almost 80,000 audio books.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.080]   You're the guy who turned me on to the Stephen King books.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.080]   How far along are you?
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.960]   I'm still on five, I think.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.600]   I still got a ways to go because I interrupt with other...
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.080]   Because I don't want to just read Stephen King for you.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.240]   Well, you'll spend a whole year doing it.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.960]   I mean, it's a year-long extravaganza.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.200]   I'm saving it for when I circumnavigate the globe and my trawler.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.640]   Then I'll have the Stephen King.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.480]   So meanwhile, I'm varying it up.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   I'm reading...
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.640]   I tell you what I'm loving right now.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.640]   Do you read sci-fi in all?
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   Are you kidding me?
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   Do you know Peter F. Hamilton?
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.640]   Hold on.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640]   You know I'm like crazy into Peter F. Hamilton.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   So you've read the Dreaming Void.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   Yes!
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   I just finished the Void trilogy.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.200]   I had read the first two and I was waiting for the third one to come out.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   So...
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.040]   I'm watching a bromance happening right here over...
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.200]   Come here and sit in my lap, Brian.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.600]   I love the singularity, too, Leo.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   Oh, Brian.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.680]   This is the greatest sci-fi book ever.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.560]   I think it's really one of my new favorites.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.280]   I am so digging it.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.880]   What's great about it, it's science fiction.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.120]   That's hardcore science fiction, but somehow manages to completely flip-flop from being
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.200]   a full-on fantasy novel.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   Within...
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   There's a...
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.200]   He mixes the genres very...
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.200]   Right.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200]   It's still...
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.280]   It's all in the same world, but there are a set of conditions that allow a fantasy novel
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.920]   to take place within the science fiction novel.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   Have you gotten to the end?
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   I'm in book one, don't say it word.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920]   Oh, wait, you're just starting it?
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920]   I'm just starting it.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920]   Okay, okay.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.520]   But you know, it's funny because I download War and Peace, which is, by the way, a damn
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.520]   long novel.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.960]   It's really, really long.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960]   Great observation.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.760]   Don't know if you heard about it yet.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   Yeah, and...
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   We learned a lot on Twitch.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.760]   I do.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.960]   Damn long novel.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.960]   There are several different versions of War and Peace, and there's a one that's really
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.680]   beautifully read and I started listening.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.080]   And then I thought, well, maybe I should do this Dreaming Void first.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.520]   I'll save War and Peace for my circumnavigation.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:17.160]   And then I realized, really, he's as good a writer as Tolstoy.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.280]   I mean, this is very vivid.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.760]   And in some ways, it's kind of like War and Peace in the sense that it's a very palpable,
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.920]   real world with a lot going on, a lot of people.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.920]   It comes alive, I have to say, this is the year 35-35.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.360]   If indeed man's still alive.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.240]   If woman can survive, they will fall in love.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.840]   There's actually a lot of hot sex in this.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.560]   But that's what's great about Peter of Hamilton is that he doesn't lose touch with what makes
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.720]   for a good story.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.680]   I was about to say, "meal."
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.680]   You gobbled the book down.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.000]   That is a good meal.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   I love this.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.960]   But anyway, that's all you could get.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.120]   This is a three book trilogy.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.080]   You can get the first two right now free.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.080]   Yes.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.000]   And of course, I don't know if the listeners, if you're going to start at the beginning,
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.520]   if you're going to, I'll tell you, your pick can be the Dreaming Void trilogy.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.520]   No, you're right.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520]   You should go back.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.360]   I'm going to say start with Pandora's Star because this takes place a thousand years
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.080]   after Pandora's Star and this is a time.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.280]   And Hanzi is still around.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280]   Yes, he is.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.280]   Boy.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   Ah, so how do I want to give spoilers to spoilers?
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.280]   Don't spoil it.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.280]   Don't spoil it.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280]   It's so good.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280]   You're right though.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.240]   Now, the only thing I don't like about Pandora's Star and then that's 37 hours.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.520]   Then there's Judas Unchained and that's another 37 hours.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.760]   But the only thing I didn't like is when Al Capone showed up.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.760]   Oh no, no, no.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   You're thinking of a different series.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760]   Oh, that's not this one.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760]   No, no, no.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.760]   You're thinking of the Knights Dawn trilogy.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.000]   Knights Dawn, I don't like that as much.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   It's a little weird.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.520]   And by the way, Major Spoiler, you just gave up on the Knights Dawn because you spend the
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.800]   whole first book not understanding what's happening.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.000]   And then that thing doesn't have until the second book.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   Oops.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   But that's all right.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Don't read the Knights Dawn trilogy anyway.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Read Pandora's Star.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.600]   No, this is the one with the with the Prime.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600]   Yes, yes.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   With the with Morninger's Law.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   Yes.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.600]   Yes.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.600]   Exactly.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.600]   You know what?
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.600]   This you're right.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.600]   This is a great.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.600]   So you got to read those two first and then this one then the Knights Dawn trilogy takes
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   place a thousand years later with a couple of the same characters.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.200]   You should read this first.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.200]   You're absolutely right.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.640]   This is two books so you can get you can get both of these and you'll be done.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.560]   And what's great is one of the characters from the first two books.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.680]   Essentially, Becky looks so bored.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:15.680]   I know.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.560]   For Denise and Becky, you're like, is this a nerd fest or what?
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   I swear to God.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.200]   No, no, I'm just thinking notes because I'm looking for my next thing to know.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.200]   Oh, you might like this.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.400]   Just for me as opposed to for my kid.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.400]   Yeah, this isn't a kid.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.400]   Downloading.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   Do you now there are there are great kid books I should say on our blog.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.400]   It's a really great.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:38.000]   In fact, I mean, Audible's why I'm not in Becky's boat of having listened to a CD recently
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.360]   because I do it all for him on Audible.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.000]   No baby beluga for you.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.400]   You've got audible.com and red wall.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.800]   Oh, I loved red wall.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.000]   When you're in about two years and two years, your kid will love red wall.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   Oh, it's such great stuff.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Well, okay.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   Yeah, Brian Jacques.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.040]   There's a lot of these.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.600]   You know that Catherine Lasky books they did the movie last fall, The Guardians of Gaheul?
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600]   Yes.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:05.080]   They did with that movie what they didn't do to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:09.200]   They took a great series of books and tried to condense it all down and it's really bad
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.280]   if you've read the books.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.720]   You don't like the movie.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.360]   So I actually haven't let him watch the movie, but the books are great.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.760]   So look for Catherine Lasky.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.560]   She's done two very long series of kids books.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:24.640]   Red wall, the author just passed away Brian Jacques and that's sad because he was writing
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.120]   an amazing series.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.200]   There are five of them now, I think.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.040]   I highly recommend those four.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.640]   I would say, what do they say?
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.120]   The age of young adults?
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.840]   No, it's a little bit younger.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.760]   I'd say a 10 year old, 11 year old boy would be perfect for this because it's about a
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.400]   mouse, a young mouse who has to, you know, learn how to fight and stuff.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.640]   They're animals.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.520]   So it's a little bit the younger kid, but I just love this.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.440]   If you love fantasy, the thing is an adult would love this too.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.440]   Well now we've just given you like 20 different books you have to get.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.120]   None of them were the ones I wanted to share.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.280]   That's the funny part, but I'll save them for another time.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.640]   All right, because there's so many.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.440]   That's just what happens when people live in Audible.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.240]   We get together, we start talking.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.800]   I've heard, so I'm going to say Pandora Star, you're right.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   That's the beginning.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.520]   That would be a good two to get if you love sci-fi, Audible.com/twit2.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.880]   It is about an epic battle for the survival of the human race.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   And it takes place.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.320]   Like it's one of those a thousand years from now, everything changes and yet the important
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.640]   part's all still the same.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.640]   Attractive ladies, attractive men getting together.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:27.040]   They're even more attractive because they've got re-juved treatments.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.040]   That's right.
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.200]   People kill each other and then it's a video game they come back.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.200]   I was not bored.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.200]   I was just obsessed with finding...
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200]   Oh my God!
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.200]   ...a tailor-hic.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   Wait, look, did you Photoshop that?
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200]   Isn't that unbelievable?
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.200]   That looks like you've Photoshopped.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.200]   No.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200]   Leo's face.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.200]   I'm going to hold that right up to the camera.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.200]   There's a real name in it.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   I can do it.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   I can do it.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   I can do it.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   I can do it.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   I can do a screen grab.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   I can do a screen grab.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   It's just from Google search images.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   It just drove me nuts the entire season.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.200]   You think that looks like me?
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.840]   Wait, I actually thought you had Photoshopped.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.440]   Leo's features onto George Clooney's face.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.280]   His head is actually strangely large.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.280]   Really?
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280]   Really?
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.280]   Seriously.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.280]   Does that look like...
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.680]   No, in fact, I actually thought it was a bad Photoshop when I first saw it.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.840]   It looks like a bad Photoshop.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.720]   No, that is the DNA mix of Leo and George Clooney.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.720]   I see.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   Case closed, my friends.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.720]   I'm just saying.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:27.160]   I think we've figured it out.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.160]   Wow.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.160]   Wow.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.160]   I don't know if you guys are watching that.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   Wow.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.160]   It's going nuts right now.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.160]   I'm obsessed with that.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   All right.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   All right.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   All right.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.160]   Great hair.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.160]   We all look alike.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.400]   Go to audible.com/twit2 and you get two books absolutely free.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   That's the platinum account.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.760]   You sign up for that and your first month's free, first books are free and you get to keep
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.760]   them forever.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.760]   So it's a great deal.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:54.760]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.560]   They say in the chatroom somebody hacked my DNA.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.560]   True.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.360]   So I got a question and I don't know if anyone else has dealt with this.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.600]   I kind of only want to bring it up if somebody has an experience that they can explain to
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.600]   me.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.320]   But has anyone used the Facebook migration tool to go from private page to a public one
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320]   yet?
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320]   No.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.320]   Well because they had it, they came out with it quietly like a couple weeks ago.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.320]   Oh, see that's a great thing because people like you really don't want your public on
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.600]   your personal page.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.480]   You want to move them to a fan page.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.480]   Right.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.080]   So the problem and the way I got rid of it was I deleted my Facebook account.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.080]   Right.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.160]   Well for those of us who don't want to follow in the footsteps of Leo, this sounded like
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.360]   a dream come true but then I read they yanked the tool earlier this week because people
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.520]   were using it not understanding that it was a permanent shift.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.600]   Your private page went to your public page and it became this only thing.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.040]   It lost all of the content that you had created.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.640]   It lost all of the messages.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.320]   Lost all it preserved who was following you.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.320]   That's not true.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.080]   But it lost all the tags, all your photos, all everything.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.240]   And in fact there was an article in Facebook.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.880]   They yanked it because nobody understood what they're doing.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.560]   Including Facebook it sounds like.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.480]   Christina Warren on Mashable details her horrific problem.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.160]   This hell on earth she created her for herself.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.840]   And however since then somebody has soft eased them through it.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.320]   But I was hoping one of you guys had experienced it because I think a lot of personalities
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.280]   when they first get started you say yes to everyone on Facebook.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.280]   I said yes to everybody.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.600]   I got 5,000 friends and that was the max and now and that was unusable.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600]   Right.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.120]   Well and I'm at that 5,000 max now.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.080]   I have to say no to a bunch of people.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.320]   But there's enough people who I care that they get what I'm putting out there right
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.160]   now that I know I should use this.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.520]   But apparently like it's difficult like you can't have the same phone number attached
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.600]   to both your private one and your public one because they're separate entities and no
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.440]   two entities can have the same phone number apparently.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.440]   So I don't know.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.440]   I deleted 10,000 people.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.400]   So yeah I remember you did that.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.160]   Why are you guys just mass murderers?
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.440]   What is wrong with you people?
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.440]   I was the no bitch.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.240]   Robert do you have a private page or a public page or for you it just doesn't matter.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.280]   Robert Facebook.com/robertscovals my private one which is pre-public because I turn everything
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:02.040]   public and then scovalizer is my public page where everybody can follow.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.600]   But I keep the private one for people I've actually met face to face and I can remember
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.560]   after I get home.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.560]   I have about 1,800 friends right now.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:18.280]   I got to the 5,000 limit very early and quickly realized that was unworkable.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.840]   I had something like 5,000 people waiting to be my friend after they got to 5,000 and
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:27.360]   it just wasn't workable and then I changed the rule I have to actually know you.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.800]   Yeah I do that too.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.600]   And that actually the sort of my private page is more like a regular Facebook page.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.600]   But that's what we really need because if we're going to report on Facebook we need
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.320]   to have the experience of what it's like to be a normal person not a you know.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   Public figure or something.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:49.680]   Hey I got to I got I got to interrupt for a second though I hate doing this show anywhere
