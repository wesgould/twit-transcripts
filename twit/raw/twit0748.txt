[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   Tech news and obsessive detail.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   I have a great panel today.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   It's just two people.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Two of my favorite people, Christina Warren, is here from a -- she's a senior cloud advocate at Microsoft.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   Channel 9.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   Hi, Christina.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   Hey, Leo.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   How are you?
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   Great.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   You're in your office and I see it says --
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   I am.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   Hello, Twit, on your whiteboard.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   Yes.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   Yes.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   I was trying to be festive or --
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   I thought maybe you felt like you should erase all the secret plans that were on there.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Oh, yes.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   All the secret secret plans.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   Yes.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   There are so many secret things that I normally have on my board completely.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   That's exactly what it was.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   Actually, I notice our other guest, Christina, is joined by Amy Webb, our favorite actress
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   from AbyWeb.io.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   And usually Amy's sitting in front of a whiteboard with secret plans on it, but I've noticed
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   you've moved your --
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   I am.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   We just moved offices in New York and I met my home office, which is also being renovated,
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   so I'm like off to the side in a hallway.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   Oh, I like to look at your whiteboard.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the whiteboard."
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the whiteboard."
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the whiteboard."
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the whiteboard."
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the whiteboard."
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the whiteboard."
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the whiteboard."
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the whiteboard."
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   Let's look back at the decade.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Two and a half hours in, we're on 2014.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   My wife's going like this.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   She's pointing at her watch.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   People are going, "Come on, hurry it up."
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   2010 took an hour.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   As it turns out, the decade was kind of top heavy.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   A lot of stuff happened in the first five or six years.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   Well, there was a lot of stuff happening around 2007 that continued.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   We had big social media launches and big computing changes.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   Well, Instagram launched in this decade was purchased in this decade.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   LinkedIn was purchased.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   I mean, there's just a ton of stories.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   The big story today, it came out in an email yesterday.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   Apple has announced that you will be able to spend exorbitant funds, huge amounts of
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   money on your Mac Pro starting Tuesday, December 10th.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   Orders will begin.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   The Mac Pro starts at $6,000.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   Oh, you wanted a monitor?
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   That'll be another $5,000.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   Oh, you wanted a monitor stand?
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   That'll be another $1,000.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   We're at 12 now, and you only have 256 gigs of storage and 32 gigs of RAM.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   Oh, you wanted more than eight cores?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   You can really, you can really spend a lot of money.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   Honestly, this is not a computer for the rest of us.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   This is a computer for you.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   I'm confused about Apple's product roadmap strategy because I mean, I had the G5, the
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   earlier, bigger, clunkier version of that machine.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   I guess we should call this one the cheese grater.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   If the last one was the...
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   The trash grater.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   The trash grater.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   The trash grater.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   There's the cheese graters, the vintage ones, then the trash and...
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   So I have the vintage...
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   Which looks more like a cheese grater than the cheese grater's done.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   So here's what I don't get.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   I appreciate the fact that it's theoretically modular and that you can theoretically add
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   components and add on your own.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   I mean, I'm sitting in front of the trash can on my desk and technically you can take it apart.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.800]   No, but you can't do anything.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   But the ports are in a dumb place.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   There's not enough ports.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.800]   The ports are in a really dumb place.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   The thing gets very, very hot.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   And ultimately, I'm not editing 4K video.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   It doesn't have enough power somehow.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   And I bought a very high-end version.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   So my question is, you know, between the multi-thousand dollar or is the thousand dollar stand that holds the multi-thousand dollar monitor?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   I don't understand what the product strategy is.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   Maybe you guys can help me figure it out.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   I mean, I think a lot of people are kind of confused with that.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   I mean, I think the product strategy is that they did actually listen to the feedback from the trash can,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   which I remember reviewing it back in, I guess what was that, 2013, 2014, whenever it came out.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   It was a 2013 mine arrived early 2014.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   Yeah, I reviewed it early.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   Years later, there were no upgrades.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   That was it.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   Which was the massive problem, right?
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   I mean, I think that, yeah, because what you bought in 2014 wound up being the exact same thing that they are still selling now.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   And to your point, Amy, yeah, the ports weren't in a great place.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   It could overheat. It didn't seem to have enough power, even if you got it.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   The way that it was, it could be modular.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   It wasn't really...
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   Yeah, and that was...
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   Two years ago, Apple had brought in some journalists and said, "We blew it."
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   Right.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   Right.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   And so I think this is then listening, in part, to what the feedback was, which is we really liked having something modular.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   We really liked being able to bring in other things, which is great.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   I think the problem is, is that when you look at the price point and putting the monitor aside,
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   because even though I think that the $1,000 for the stand is idiotic and ridiculous, just include it,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   if this is what it's going to cost with the stand, just map it in.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   Well, this is a separate thing to me, just makes no sense.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   But I feel like the rest of the industry has moved on from the point where what Apple is charging for what you're getting,
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   you know, you can look at what Amy AMD is doing with Ryzen.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   You can look at some other things and people are just going, "Okay, do I need this?"
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   And even Apple, it's sort of confusing because for a lot of people, an iMac Pro or even a 5K iMac,
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   or even the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is going to be more than sufficient for your needs rather than spending, you know, 12,000 dollars.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   Right.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   They're also pretty expensive.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   And so this comes back to my question, which is, who are these devices intended for?
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   Because I keep hearing these are high-end models intended not for the masses, but for a rarefied group of professionals working in a particular field.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   I kind of feel like between the most recent iPhone launch and, you know, this new iPhone launch, the new Mac Pro,
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   the previous stand, the previous devices, and even on the MacBook Air, which also has apparently no ports,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   which makes me crazy.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   It has two, but they're all the same.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   Right.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   I mean, I think this is like, I'm not sure, who's doing the math over there?
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   Yeah, no.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   Now, unfortunately, you two have just placed me in the position of Apple Apologist, which is the last place in the world I want to be.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   But to their credit, they're making a lot of money.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   I mean...
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   No one's arguing that.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   It's not like they're suffering because of their choices.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   They're... are they making... I mean, that's the question.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   Of course, they're making money hand over fist.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   They're making money hand over fist.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   I think that there's an open question.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   Could they be making more money if they were priced slightly differently, right?
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   I think that's a valid thing to say when it comes to the Mac Pro itself.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   Well, I didn't even say that.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   The PC industry is dying.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   The Windows machine industry, these companies are suffering with razors in margins.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   Apple has huge margins and is far from dying.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   But the same...
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   I'm not talking about PC as Leo.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   I'm talking about phones.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   I mean, I think that you could make an argument that...
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   I think you could make... and actually they did.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   The phones are cost less than they did a year ago.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   They did actually... like they lowered the price of the iPhone 11 compared to the 10R.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   They came down some there.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   Even $50 is still a difference.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   When you look at the Mac Pro, I mean, I think that frankly, that only audience, in an ideal world,
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   you would think that people doing, you know, CUDA tasks and doing a lot of ML stuff.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   The problem is, is they don't use NVIDIA chips.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   They use AMD.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   So that's not even actually a good use case.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   NVIDIA is an asset.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   They're going to stop doing drivers for Macintosh.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   So you won't be able to use...
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   Right.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   But my point is that even if you were, like right now, people who were trying to make that work,
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   whether it's a hack...
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   You can do it.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   You could do an eGPU with a Mac and use it via the card.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   Yeah, you can.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   But you won't be able to going forward.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   The point, Leo, that would be that if you were buying a $12,000 machine for CUDA stuff,
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   then getting eGPUs is not your best use case.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   You were actually much better off using a different operating system.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   That's going to be the platform and those are going to be the use cases you're doing.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   Because as good as the Vegas can be for certain use cases, that's just not what they're optimized for.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   I think Apple's suffering a little bit here because it took...
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   It took...
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   It's taken them two years to create this.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   Yes.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   I think to their credit, they did listen to high-end pros.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   Apple, which used to tout the fact that it was a computer for the rest of us many decades ago.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   Clearly, this is not the computer for the rest of us, but maybe you could argue that some of their other stuff is.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   This is a computer as high-end as you can get.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   It's intended for high-end creative professionals in video, photography, 3D design, 3D rendering.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   And for those people, if you're doing 8K video or you're doing music with 1,000 tracks, logic project,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   this is a reasonable expense.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   They're spending a lot of money for those tools.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   Those tools are their professional tools.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   They pay for themselves.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   Even that expensive monitor is actually cheaper than a high-end monitor.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   Yes, the monitor.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   The monitor I don't actually have an image with.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   So this is a market.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   It's a very small market.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   Well, there's a market.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   And I have to think Apple's whole intent with this was to say, I mean, they got a...
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   There was a little bit of a black mark on the trash can back that Amy and I bought.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   There was a little bit of a...
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   And so I think what they're saying is, well, if price were no object, we could design the hell out of this thing.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   So let's do it.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   I still think, I think that they, from my vantage point, I don't see what the longer term...
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   I don't see a narrative arc in the house.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   I'll tell you, here's the narrative arc for this.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   This is just like Ford building a...
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   What do they call their race car, the GTO.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   There's this Ford building a $500,000 race car.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   Nobody's going to buy that, but it looks good on the track.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   And people will know Ford can make this.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   And then that will trickle down.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   And I think that's what this is.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   This is their GTO.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   I mean, yeah, I agree with you, but I disagree slightly.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   Like, I agree with you and I think that there is a market for this.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   They're certainly not looking at selling massive numbers of these the same way they didn't sell massive numbers of the trash cans.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   I think what's hurt them though with video editors because I talk to a lot of them.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   And I've worked with them for many, many years is that because of the botch of the final cut 10 rollout,
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   even though a lot of those things have been fixed.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   And then because of the failures around the trash can, Mac Pro, many, many video editors who are largely at this point very committed to premier,
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   it doesn't really matter to them whether they're using a Mac or they're using a PC.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   And if you're building a PC, you could build something with Ryzen, the newest AMD Ryzen chip,
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   which is now like a 16 core chip.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   And that's not even getting into their really high end stuff.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   You could build something that would be very, very comparable for much less money.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   So, you know, I think you're right.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   It is proprietary stuff in here.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   And that's in a way that negative on this is that it's Apple proprietary.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   The video cards, the way they're mounted, all of that stuff is kind of Apple proprietary.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   So you can't build a PC that's exactly the same.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   But I do think Apple suffered because they've been designing this for years.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   They missed out on Ryzen.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   A PC company is much more nimble in the sense that they're cranking out new models all the time.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   And so they can say, "Hey, look, this Ryzen chip is better than the current Intel chip price performance.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   Let's go put a Ryzen chip in there.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   Next year, Ryzen is going to go 64 core.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   Apple is going to look silly with their, what is it, 28 core Mac Pro.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   So I think that's just a flaw.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   You know, I don't think this is Apple's bread and butter though, to be fair.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   This is, again, this is their GT.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   This is their...
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   It may not be, but I haven't seen a lot of innovation coming out of Apple in a long time.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   I mean, you know...
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   You know what's interesting is Apple also doesn't see a lot of growth in their market,
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   which is why they've reposition themselves as a services company.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   And last quarter, the last reporting quarter, which ended in October, they had $12 billion in service revenue,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   which is App Store, Apple TV, Apple Music, iCloud.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   iCloud, yep.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   And that's their new profit center.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   So remember, Apple changed as accounting a couple of quarters ago.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   I said, "We're not going to report unit sales anymore.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   We're going to report revenue per customer."
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   But I mean, that was partially to mitigate the lackluster iPhone sales, which are down...
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   It's like 9%, 10%, something like that.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   It didn't look as good to say what the unit sales were there.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   But on the other hand, their revenue per customer is pretty darn good.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   I'm happy for Apple to pivot to services, but the services better be damn good.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   They're not.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   I will tell you...
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   They're not.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   No, I will tell you that.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   I fired up just for the hell of it here.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   For everybody listening who cares about privacy, here's a fun thing that I discovered a couple of days ago.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   So I got subscription free, whatever, for the new Apple TV product, which replaced...
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   So I have not opened up iTunes.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   When Apple started monkeying around with all of the playlists, I got irritated and haven't opened up iTunes or Apple TV now in years.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   Let me guess.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   You're using Spotify.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   I am.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   Like the rest of the world.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   So, anyhow, I opened up Apple TV.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   Now, I am somebody who, anybody who watches or listens to the show knows cares a lot about privacy.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   I have a different made up email address and very difficult password for every single service that I use and none of them are linked together, which I've done intentionally.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   I turn on Apple TV and right below the morning show promo is exactly where I left off watching Fleabag on Amazon and exactly where I left off watching whatever I was watching on Netflix.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   I mean, it's all there.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   And I was...
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   How do they know?
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   I was like, I almost had broken into.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   Well, I didn't... I mean, I guess I gave somebody permissions at some point through the TOS, but man, I was ticked off.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   Yeah, I think the way that works is if you've entered in your password into those apps on one of your devices, it can share that, I guess, is how that would work.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   So Fleabag's on Amazon Prime.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   You have an Amazon Prime app on your Apple TV.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   You were watching it on Roku, but as far as that Amazon Prime's concerned, the platform's irrelevant.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   It knows what you're going to watch next.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   And then Apple TV...
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   I think it was iOS porting everything in into the new Apple TV, which is problematic for a couple of reasons.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   It's not.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   It's not?
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   No, it's your Amazon Prime.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   If you have an Amazon Prime on your Apple TV logged in, it knows where you left off on every other platform.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   And that's what's going to show you.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   And then where you might not like it, all of that gets piped into Apple TV, that big front page app that they want you to use.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   The only company that doesn't do that, you don't have to, is Netflix.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   So you notice it doesn't know what's next on your Netflix, but it knows what's next on everything else because you've logged into everything else on your Apple TV.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   It doesn't have to go through iOS.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   My point is this, because it lives, because where I left off on the show, now lives inside of the Apple TV app on my iPad, that tells me that there's a...
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   Well, to be fair, it lives inside your Amazon Prime account, all of those things.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   And Amazon knows it.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   Amazon's telling Apple when you launch your Apple TV.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   That doesn't mean Apple's...
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   No, no, no, but you do have the option to choose yes or no if you want the TV app to use.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   Right.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   And honestly, like you could say no or even then...
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   Yeah, of late because services are so important for Apple, the TV app has done a lot to promote Apple TV plus.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   Right, right.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   And I don't want to see all those ads.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   The same reason I stopped using Amazon devices, because it was all about Amazon Prime.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   So if you want, you can use the Apple TV like it used to be, which is just your...
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   So this is what gets me to the services.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   Because I know that, I mean, I'm not sure what Apple is doing with music.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   I'm not sure what Apple is attempting to do with these awards and all of these other things.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   But if you think of Apple as a sort of...
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   One of the things I've been thinking about is, is there a new kind of meta platform in the process of being born?
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   Oh, that's a great question. I think that's the case.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   Right.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   That's what I...
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   After I was irritated and felt violated, the thing that I was left with was, "Huh,
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   whoever's got the shell, the UX shell here seems to maybe potentially have access to the data that I've worked very hard to
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   de-identify across all these different services."
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   Yeah, I don't think they actually have access to the data.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   I don't know if they actually have access to the data.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   I don't know either.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   I mean, it's a valid question to ask, right?
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   And it's worth looking into.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.800]   But I don't know if they do.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   From what I understand, they don't.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   From what I understand, it's basically just an API piping in.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   Unlike Google and Facebook...
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   Unlike Google and Facebook.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   Unlike Google and Facebook and Android, maybe Windows, Apple tries really hard to do stuff on device.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   And so I'm almost certain, and you're right, I haven't looked either, but I'm almost certain.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   And I think it's usually safe to assume that that's the Apple TV.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   That data is stuck in the Apple TV, that it's not sending it back to Apple.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   But who knows, there's value in it.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   And frankly, if I were you, Amy, I'd be more worried about the fact that if you're watching that on a Samsung TV or a Sony TV, it's telling Samsung and Sony that you're watching it.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   I mean, if you've got an Amazon Echo running, it's probably listening in.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   If you've got a Google phone, it's almost certainly listening in.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   Right.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   The kind of interesting thing is that we believe that when we watch something, it's one directional.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   Yeah, that's...
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   And really, anytime we are watching anything, multiple parties are watching us back.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   Not just one.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   Yes.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   So this is the interesting point that I hear from Apple users all the time is the reason they use Apple is because they trust Apple to a greater degree than they trust all these other people.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   And Apple certainly plays on that by saying constantly, it's on device, it's on device.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   It's why Siri is so useless.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   Right.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   It's because so little information is getting sent back to Apple.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   Now, it really...
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   All of this, how you feel about Google, Facebook, Apple, anybody, Amazon comes down really to personal feeling because we don't have a lot of information.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   It's all kind of a gut feeling based on what we've observed.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   And it could very well be.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   And I think there are a lot of people who make the argument.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   Well, the only reason Apple doesn't care is because they had an ad platform that failed.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   So they're not trying to sell ads anymore.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   They tried, I adds, but it didn't work.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   So they're making a virtue out of a necessity.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   And who knows?
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   I mean, maybe they secretly harbor an interest in collecting this data.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   Certainly there's a lot of revenue there.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   And if you're a services company, then...
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   I won't go that far.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   Here's what I will say.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   Apple will only protect your privacy as long as the money went maker for them.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   The minute it's a money loser for them, I don't think they have philosophically an objection to going in another direction.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   So let's go back to that idea of a meta platform.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   Here's sort of where I think this is potentially heading.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   You know, we have all of these PII's personally identifiable information following us around everywhere.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   I'm going to sneeze.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800]   No, I'm not going to sneeze.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   I know something about you now.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   Everybody does.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   So if we're talking about...
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   Esther Dyson used to call that your data smog.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   Yeah, so gas coming out of here.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   Right, so here's the question.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   You know, is it plausible that Apple and others are in the process of developing sort of personal data records, a single place that houses all of our data within one system?
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   I mean, they're kind of already doing that.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   But if you look at Apple's foray into health and health care systems...
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   Well, that's a perfect example.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   So for instance, Apple Health now lets me tie into my medical provider.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   Right.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   And so all my health records are now in Apple Health.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   But Apple says very clearly in the terms of service, this never leaves your phone.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   We do not get this information.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   It doesn't matter.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   That's the services piece of this.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   They don't have to mine and refine the data in order to derive value.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   Well, that's my contention.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   So Apple, as long as they see a revenue positive direction that protects privacy will go that way.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   As long as it makes them money, in fact, it might make them more money because they're the privacy protectors.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   And a lot of people these days were going to go there.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   They're going to do that.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   But the minute it was a money, it's a money loser.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   I can guarantee you Apple would say, "Well, now we'd like Siri to be better."
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   Or we could do a better job of protecting your health if you would give us your health information.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   Well, so that's the interesting thing.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   Are we...
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   So on this thread just really quickly because Amazon and Google are also both going in the same direction.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   Well, we know Amazon is going in.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   Great thing of all of our PIs.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   The revenue derived is through mining and refining, I think, on Amazon and Google side.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   You know, if Apple emerges as the top tier, I guess what I'm getting at is maybe there's a new kind of wealth device
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   processing born, but one derived from data.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   People have said that.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   In fact, there was a whole piece in the New York Times some weeks ago as privacy as a luxury item.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   And that's the interesting thing.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   It is expensive to be in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   That was actually me who said that.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   I will send you the link right now.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   See, you're so smart.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   I knew it was somebody smart.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   No, I've got that too.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   That's great.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   Yeah, no, and I think you're exactly right.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   And I think that that's the point.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   I think you make a great point.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   Amy, like there are a number of different companies who are trying to do this meta kind of ecosystem.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   Amy, you know you've made it when I'm quoting you back to yourself.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   Well, it's possible to somebody else, but that's the...
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   Sorry, Kristin.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   No, no, no, no.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   I actually think it wasn't me because I remember reading that and thinking, "Oh, I know her."
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   No, but that's exactly right.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   I mean, look, to your point, Leo, I mean, I can't, I'm not going to try to speak on behalf
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   of any company, not even my own that I work for.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   When it comes to this stuff, Apple, I do think, you know, they've made it very clear that one
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   of their values, they've stated that one of their values is privacy.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   And look, we can be cynical and say it's probably because it's a differentiator, right?
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   That's where I get cynical.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.400]   When they say it's our DNA, it's our values.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.080]   We're living our values.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.880]   I don't buy that because when Russia says, "Well, now you have to put Russia lips on
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   iPhone."
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   They don't leave Russia.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.480]   When China says, "Now you have to give us dissidents data."
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   They don't...
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:33.080]   So their values are very conveniently commercial, but honestly, if you think any corporation
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.280]   in the world acts on anything but the profit motive, you're a naive.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.200]   But this is my point, I'm just saying, and I don't actually care if it is a cynical
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.520]   reason or if it's something else or maybe it's they don't have the abilities right now
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.800]   to mine the data the way that Amazon and Google.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.840]   It's a good marketing ploy.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.840]   It is.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.200]   But I do think that as we create an interesting kind of dichotomy because to Amy's point,
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.560]   there are these, we now have Google, you have Amazon, you have Apple, who are all trying
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.200]   to very much kind of do a similar thing in terms of getting everybody to share their
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.640]   data through them as kind of like the gatekeeper, and if Apple is able to say, "Well, we won't
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.840]   actually give up your data or intermingle it and we are going to be secure this way, but
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.400]   we are going to charge you more as a result of that."
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.560]   There is a large number of people who have the means to do that who will do it.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.720]   But to Amy's point, that does then create kind of this class society, which is, "Okay,
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.480]   the people who have a certain amount of money can take part in this and the people who don't,
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.200]   their information is going to be mined."
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.240]   Although I do have to wonder though, at a certain point, the people who are wanting to
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.320]   mine this data, if you realize that all the high income people and the people that have
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.760]   like maybe the most are the most targetable and most desirable, if they're not available
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.280]   to you, does that ever have a certain point lessen the value of the data that's being
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.760]   leaked from others and maybe make it not quite as a threat?
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.400]   This is where scale comes into play.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:06.800]   There's far more value to be derived, I think, in Amazon's version of this ecosystem.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:13.480]   Amazon doesn't just have Alexa smart speakers.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.880]   They've got smart microwaves.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   They've got many different smart devices.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.240]   They've partnered with Lanar, which is one of America's largest home builders.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.200]   In their process of building entire smart homes, which you can actually buy on Amazon, if you
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.920]   go to turnkey.com.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.960]   You can now look for one of these homes.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.800]   These are not super, super expensive multi-billion dollar homes or multi-million dollar homes.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:42.920]   I grew up in Chicago and not in a totally blue collar neighborhood and not too far away
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:49.640]   from where I grew up are some pretty spectacular Amazon homes.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.360]   If we start to look at the downstream implications of all of this, what does it mean?
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:00.200]   It means that the people who are being targeted in Amazon's ecosystem are probably the ones
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.400]   who are going to be on the more vulnerable end in a free market economy.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:11.800]   We should mention that Amy's written a great book on this subject called The Big Nine,
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.840]   How the Tech Titans and their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.000]   You talk about this and you include Apple in The Big Nine.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.320]   You don't give Apple a pass.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:26.360]   Well, I'm not necessarily saying these companies are evil and I'm not saying that they are,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.000]   even the Chinese ones.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.720]   I am oftentimes saying that Facebook is evil.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.720]   I think Facebook has made some horrifically bad.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.360]   You're all agreed Facebook is evil.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.360]   There's no...
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.440]   The jury is not out on that one.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.040]   And I grew up in that collective Microsoft and IBM.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.160]   I think a lot of people have mistakenly written off Microsoft.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.480]   And yet, literally the world does not work without Microsoft.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.960]   It's the invisible infrastructure that powers everything.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.440]   As your is.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.640]   And the same deal with IBM.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.400]   I think a lot of people have written them off and don't understand why you would group
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.200]   them in with these other big companies.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.560]   What's the acronym for these companies?
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.240]   I'm trying to remember.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   G-Mophia.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   G-Mophia.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240]   G-Mophia.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   Googled.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   Yeah, G-Mophia.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.040]   Apple, Facebook, IBM, and Amazon.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   Right.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   And then the Chinese.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.000]   And then the Chinese, 10 San Ali Baba and Baidu.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   The bats.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   The bats.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   So G-Mophia bat will give you the nine.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   But I don't think that they are.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I think...
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   I'm not calling them evil.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.600]   I don't think the big tech companies are evil necessarily.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.520]   I think we've got a systems level problem here.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:42.200]   And usually systems level problems that are gnarly and complicated require deep, deep
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   questions and systems level solutions.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.800]   We just haven't started to do that yet.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   That's all.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.240]   Yeah, evil is a value judgment.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.400]   But I would say they are amoral as all companies are.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.760]   They operate to maximize profit.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.960]   And that is not a moral system necessarily.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.720]   Sometimes you get people at the top who say, "Well, God, that's so, so, so interesting
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.960]   that you just said that, Leo, because I hadn't thought about it that way before, but you're
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   right.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.160]   These are amoral companies that have a fiduciary responsibility to their own.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.760]   They're shareholders and yet."
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   Right.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.480]   But they are a moral and yet we are assigning, we are mad at them for not reflecting our
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   morals and values.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:28.920]   Well, the one caveat I would say there is as a person who works at one of these GMOPHIA
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.840]   companies or one of these big nine or whatever is that the people who work at these places,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.600]   just because the companies themselves are amoral, which is true, doesn't mean the people who
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.160]   work there aren't, right?
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   Absolutely.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   Absolutely.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.320]   But this is becoming a much bigger thing, right?
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.080]   This has been happening with a lot of the different contracts and the laws of the White
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   House other things.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.320]   Look at the protests that were happening over Jedi at your company at Google, at Amazon.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   Yes.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.680]   This is exactly what I'm saying.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:01.760]   And I think that there, I think when we say things like these companies are amoral and
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.480]   there isn't anything, I guess, we in some ways kind of walk it off as if, "Oh, well,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   there's nothing we can do and there's nothing to stop any of this."
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:15.920]   That's not true because the people who work at those places to varying degrees do have
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.560]   control over things.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.920]   And I think this is why organizing is important.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.200]   I think this is why people speaking up as important and why it's important for the people
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:29.400]   who are involved, especially in things that could be problematic and could have a potential
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.000]   impact on lots of different things.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.080]   It's important for those people to feel empowered to speak up and do things.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.440]   It's a particular problem at tech companies because, like Google, these engineers are
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.920]   more valuable than the average employees.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.760]   And so when the engineers at Google stand up and say, "We don't want to do face recognition
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.680]   for the Department of Defense," that carries more weight.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.280]   If the people at my company stand up and say, "We don't want to do something," I just say,
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   "Well, thanks.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.000]   See you later."
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.480]   But engineers are such a valuable asset.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   They do.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.200]   I wonder, though, ultimately.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:11.040]   You guys won the Jedi contract much to Jeff Bezos' disappointment.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.760]   Google probably is doing Defense Department work.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:19.600]   Ultimately, it's the responsibility of Sachin Adela and Sonar Pichai and Jeff Bezos.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:26.080]   Their ultimate responsibility is to balance all of this with one goal to produce value
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.560]   for their shareholders.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:35.080]   And so they're balancing the engineers not liking it, but only economically, not morally.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.560]   Brad Smith at Microsoft, I think, is doing some really interesting things around...
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.000]   Well, a couple of things.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.600]   One, I think that there are some conversations around prioritizing stakeholder value, at least
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.840]   on the same level as shareholder value.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.040]   Stakeholders, including employees, obviously.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   Correct.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.760]   And being better stewards of the environment and everything else.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:09.000]   Well, that's my apple, by the way, plowed $18 billion into stock buybacks, not because
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.640]   it made them feel good, but because it enhanced the value of the stocks their employees had.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.320]   It made it easier to hire good people.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.760]   Stock share value is very, very important to these companies.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:28.920]   I'm... Brad Smith, I think, is I think a clever student of geopolitics and geoeconomics and
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:35.480]   has been in the process of building a corporate foreign policy group within Microsoft, which
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   I think is smart.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.200]   That's interesting, yeah.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.240]   I also know that they're reorganizing a little bit to engage in more long-term corporate
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:49.480]   foresight and strategic planning, which is the stuff that I do, which is good.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.000]   I mean, I think it would be...
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   And that's kind of what...
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   I don't know.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.200]   I'm curious to know what's happening with the changes at Alphabet.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   Yeah, we could...
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   We're going to talk about that in a little bit.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   Well, just...
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.640]   That's a huge change.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:13.240]   My sense is working with all of these big companies is that there's started to be more
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:20.800]   of a focus on longer-range planning, and I think maybe there are some strategic planning
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.880]   going on now that goes beyond five years.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:29.600]   Yeah, but it wasn't it widely known that the idea of focusing on quarterly results has
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.240]   really been to the detriment of American industry.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.080]   Yeah, but it took everybody a really long time to figure that out.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:41.440]   We all knew it before they did, but again, stock share value is really important to these
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.640]   companies for a variety of reasons.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   Sure, of course.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.440]   If the stock market says, "You don't like your quarterly results," that's a problem.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.200]   But so now, here's where things get a little finicky, I think, and tricky, and that's because
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.560]   there's not just humans who are in the stock market anymore.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.400]   60% of the trades are quant funds in ETFs, which are initially designed...
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.880]   So these are algorithmically traded funds that have factors that are initially determined
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:16.360]   by humans, but they're making quick trades based increasingly on things that humans aren't
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   determining.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.400]   Yeah, technical factors.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.160]   And we're all a little guilty.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:28.120]   As an older person, I'm very guilty because I have my retirement in market baskets and
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:36.160]   ETFs, and so I'm plowing money into those funds and driving it.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.480]   So there's billions and billions of dollars going into these big funds.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:45.000]   Okay, so now let me just tie this back to what we were talking about related to Apple's
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.400]   data and Amazon's data.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:54.440]   So Amazon is getting into the housing market through its investment in Lanar and turnkey
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.440]   and all the rest of it.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.240]   They also just announced a billion-
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.080]   Multi-billion dollar investment in housing in Silicon Valley, right?
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   As a true-
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.480]   And they've been buying a pre-fab home.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.400]   And so here's where I think things are interesting because if you think, again, of sort of the
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:17.880]   meta-platform example, what if Amazon decided to start trading on its proprietary data related
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.200]   to the housing market?
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.040]   In some way, Amazon could be positioning itself to, in a very...
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:31.080]   It's just a couple of years, have more actionable, meaningful data about our US housing market
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.800]   than the US government does.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.520]   And I don't think there's anything stopping from a legal or technical standpoint, stopping
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.520]   them from doing that.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   I don't know.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.840]   There might be some SEC things around market making.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.840]   It would be complicated.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.800]   I don't want to speak to that because...
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   But you're right.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.760]   I mean, if it could certainly be a possibility, I don't know.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.960]   If there are things, I'm sure there are things that they would probably be able to find,
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.160]   maybe loopholes around.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.240]   But typically, yeah, I mean, that's a really good point that if they have that type of proprietary
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.480]   information that they would be able to make better trades on investments in the housing
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:07.560]   market because their internal data is better than what the government is giving them.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:16.200]   I forgot where I read this number, but Amazon has somewhere in the neighborhood of 150
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.480]   economist PhDs on staff.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:28.040]   And I'm fairly certain that the federal reserve does not have that many science or AI PhDs
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.800]   on their staff.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   Totally.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   You're completely right.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   That's a great...
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   That's a great...
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:39.400]   That doesn't make you feel like you're going to believe your pants.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   Let's take a little break.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   This is a good conversation.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400]   And of course it is.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   I knew it would be.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.920]   We've got Christina Warren.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:51.520]   She is responsible for advocating for that cloud we've been talking about at Microsoft.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:58.640]   And Futurist, Amy Webb, and you've got to read that book, that I would also say for a
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:05.280]   lot of people, Shoshana Zuboff's book is also...
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   Surveillance Capitalism.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.440]   Kind of critical reading.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:13.800]   I would be critical as you read it, but it's input that's very interesting.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   It's very, very long.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.960]   She and I have the same editor at Public Affairs.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.760]   So I remember when he was attempting to edit that book.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.360]   She wrote a lot, but she worked on it for a long, long time.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:32.120]   Yeah, it's an important, I think, part of our...
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:37.520]   Her thesis and the research is vitally important in every conversation going forward.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.520]   And she's brilliant.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.600]   It's a fascinating topic.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.080]   And we talk about it a lot more than I thought we would.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.720]   When I first started covering tech, I thought I'd be talking about the latest computer chips
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.680]   and how much RAM is enough.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.800]   It's really metamorphosed as tech has become an integral part of the fabric of our society.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:05.440]   And we're all grappling with what do we do about it?
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.480]   Even if it's humans, as you make an excellent point, it's like Soylent Green.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.840]   Big tech companies are made of people.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:20.760]   But they also move in a way that is maybe less people-driven.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.080]   So it's fascinating to watch.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:28.280]   I guess this is really what you are constantly banging your head against, Dami, as you can
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.960]   figure out what's going on in the future.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.120]   Let's take a little break, come back with more in just a bit.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.240]   Including, yeah, new leadership at Alphabet, which might not make any difference at all.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   I don't know.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   I want to talk to you about this thing, because this is the best thing ever.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   This is my molecule.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.360]   This is the new mini molecule or a little molecule.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.920]   The molecule is air purification done right.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   It's not a filter.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.720]   It's not a HEPA filter.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.680]   HEPA, which was invented during World War II, is really just a filter that traps big particles
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.080]   and stores them in the filter to throw it out.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.520]   Molecule goes to the next step.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.600]   It actually purifies your air using something they call PICO.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.480]   Photo electrochemical oxidation.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:17.280]   It provides a solution for the entire home when it comes to air purification.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.400]   Because they have two devices now, you can choose the option that's best for your space,
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:27.960]   the molecule air for the big rooms or this molecule mini for a smaller space or a combination.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.480]   We got our first molecule because Lisa was complaining about waking up with sinus head
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.320]   every morning.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.000]   I felt bad, and so we got the molecule, immediately cleared them up.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.160]   I thought, "Oh, this is interesting.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.280]   In fact, we know when the molecule has been turned off, if somebody unplugs it, the house
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.880]   cleaners unplug it or somebody's in the...
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.640]   Something goes wrong."
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.080]   She wakes up with a headache and she says, "Check the molecule."
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   Of course, immediately.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.440]   It was off.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.840]   We know it works.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:03.360]   I want to show you the PICO filter because it's a really interesting technology.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.400]   It's like a electrochemical reaction.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:13.160]   It's like a metal ring that attracts the smallest things, not even trappable by HEPA
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:18.960]   filters, like mold, viruses, bacteria, even volatile organic compounds, things like the
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.640]   formaldehyde coming off your carpets or paint fumes.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.160]   It traps them and then it uses a UV light to burn them up.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.800]   They are destroyed.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:34.760]   Instead of becoming a carrier for all these pollutants, it actually captures them and destroys
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   them.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.320]   That's PICO.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:44.640]   It's a two-step filter.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.400]   That gets the pet hair and the bigger stuff.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.600]   Then inside, I can't really take it out.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.160]   Inside is the little...
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.920]   The oxidizing tube.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   That captures it.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.120]   Then there's a UV light that just burns it up.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.120]   It is awesome.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.200]   Actually, if you go to the website, you can see how it works.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.280]   M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E dot com.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:09.960]   This was invented over... it was actually patented over 20 years ago by the director of Clean
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.600]   Energy Research Center at the University of South Florida.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.840]   They patented the system, "Bakes down pollutants to harmless components."
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:24.480]   It's been tested in labs all over the world.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   It really works.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.200]   It's... I devouged for it.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.760]   It really does the job.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:34.600]   It's easy to use if you've got headaches from allergies or sinuses or if you've got...
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.800]   If you've got chemicals, this is great in those sick offices where you can't open the
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.040]   windows.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.080]   It will turn that air into breathable air.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.080]   You got to get it.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:49.480]   You get 10% off your first air purifier when you go to molecule.com and use the promo code
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.040]   "Twit10."
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.560]   You can even pair this to your Wi-Fi.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.960]   There's an app and it will automatically... We just got our new filters.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   It was kind of nice.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.480]   I didn't know I was going to get them.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.200]   But it knows when the filters get low and sends you new filters automatically.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.560]   That's pretty cool too.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:09.160]   Molecule.com, promo code "Twit10" for 10% off your first molecule air purifier.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.920]   It really is amazing.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.800]   Amy Webb, Christina Warren.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.840]   We're talking about the week's news.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.640]   Can I pipe in with a little bit of news?
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   Pipe in.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.640]   There's news.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.640]   Because I didn't see it on the rundown.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.640]   What's the news?
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.080]   Tonight's the final episode of Silicon Valley.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   Final ever.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   It's all over.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.640]   Final ever.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:38.520]   Do you think Pied Piper will become a unicorn?
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.320]   I got to say, this season I'm a huge Mike Judge fan.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   Me too.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   I love King of the Health.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.320]   And Beavis in butthad.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   Of course.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   Off the space.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   Off the space.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.320]   But this is...
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.320]   Idiocracy.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   The tightest writing.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.560]   Oh my God.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.360]   It's unbelievable what they've been able to pack into like 28 minutes each week.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.360]   It's pretty good.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.680]   Cara Swisher has a big role in one of the episodes.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   She does.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   She's great.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   She's really good.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   Who's really good after?
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:15.120]   And my favorite part of the season so far, the guy who has a chair attached to his butt.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   Yeah, he's hilarious.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   He can sit down anywhere.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.920]   He's hilarious.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.160]   And Russ Fest.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.160]   That's where I am right now.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.800]   So I've got a couple of episodes behind.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   None of that was the last one.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   Oh.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   So tonight's the night.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.200]   So there's no spoilers because it hasn't happened yet.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.360]   But I just wanted to mention it because it's...
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.360]   It's great.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.360]   No, it is great.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.360]   And it's interesting.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.640]   I mean, I think that the writers that they said, you know, we kind of have to end it now
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.000]   because the show itself, like the world has become a parody.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.800]   The show can't really even paradise.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.760]   It's amazing how many shows that that's happened to.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.280]   Beavis the same way, right?
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:53.000]   Like there's a certain point when you can't do it anymore because the satire no longer
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.200]   really, it's no longer a satire.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:01.000]   Amy worked on a show that I hope is coming back with Sean Penn.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Nope.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   It's called the first.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.440]   I don't think we got renewed.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:12.080]   I actually do quite a bit of work on different shows and movies and things that are set in
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.080]   the future.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.480]   I really liked it.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.120]   It was the...
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.680]   It's sad because it ended as they were on their way to Mars.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:28.200]   So the first was a show on Hulu from Bo Willman who is an unbelievably talented playwright.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.840]   And showrunner, he did House of Cards the first couple seasons.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:36.320]   I think the problem with the way that the first...
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.000]   First of all, I think part of the problem was Hulu's interface absolutely sucks.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.640]   I agree.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   Hulu is terrible.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.640]   Oh my God.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.440]   I'm like, Christina, can you...
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.440]   Are you a Hulu?
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.440]   Do you get through it?
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.440]   Of course she is.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.200]   Because it's got Gilmore Girls.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   I can't.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.880]   Well, it's not Gilmore Girls, but I think that's on Netflix.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.720]   I love Hulu just because it has everything.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.720]   But I'm with you.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   The interface.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.720]   And I tried really hard.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.720]   I tried to be like, "All right, I can make this work.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   I can do it."
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.720]   And it's like, "Nope, really..."
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.720]   This is where the Apple TV...
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.560]   This is where the meta platform honestly comes in handy because I can add things to
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.440]   my queue and then the Apple TV app will just show me what I need.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   But I'm with you because it's like...
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   I wouldn't watch my whole king of the hell episodes.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   You know, and I'm like, "Things...
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   I want to watch ER."
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.440]   My favorite TV show ever.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.040]   In a way, it's very hard.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:26.440]   Idiocracy is a show about the future that is slowly coming true.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.280]   Kind of like network.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.920]   Yeah, network as well.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.720]   I'm going to give my judge a little credit as a futurist because when did he make idiocracy?
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   More...
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:44.720]   He's just a really, really astute observer of the human condition I think.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.440]   And because he's told now similar stories but in very, very different ways.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   And just brilliant.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:55.680]   I met him when they first started to do Silicon Valley.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.880]   And no one really knew that it was going to be that successful.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:02.680]   I remember when they launched South by in 2014.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.680]   And there was kind of this sense of even amongst Silicon Valley people, "Oh, I don't
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.680]   know.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   Is this going to be a thing?
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   Is anyone going to like this?"
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.160]   And I was like, "Oh, I saw the first three episodes."
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.160]   I was like, "Oh, this is great.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.360]   I think this is going to be a hit."
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:19.200]   But I don't think anybody anticipated that it would kind of take over the way it has.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.880]   They launched, I guess, for the final season.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.720]   They launched a thing, Leo, where you can make your own intro to the show.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.080]   And at the end, instead of saying Silicon Valley, you could say like whatever you want.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.080]   I love the intro.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.480]   I'm sure that didn't go wrong for anybody.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.760]   I love the intro because I'm always looking for logos and stuff.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.760]   There's a lot of little jokes in the intro.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.960]   You want to stop it and pause it and look at it.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:44.640]   There is, I have one complaint, which is that Camal Nandani has been lifting too much weights.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.440]   He looks good.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.440]   He's beefed up.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.440]   He's beefed up.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.440]   He's got movie roles.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.440]   He's got movie roles.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.280]   He's got it's been a kind of star.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.880]   He's too stubby looking for Dinesh.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:01.040]   Guilfoyle, I'm glad to say, is the same weasily, pasty-faced program.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.880]   Guilfoyle is kind of my type though, if I have to be full of this.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   He's my type.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.760]   He's my kind of best cynical.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.520]   Yeah, no, I know.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.360]   We all love Guilfoyle.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.920]   Let's talk about Larry Page.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.480]   He's stepping down 21 years ago.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:27.440]   Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google and built it for a while.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:31.440]   Then they hired Eric Schmidt for "adult supervision."
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.440]   Schmidt let Larry take back over his CEO, but as a number of people have pointed out,
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.240]   it seems like Sergey has pretty dialed out.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.840]   Larry was almost dialed out.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.680]   It didn't seem like they were very much.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:48.960]   They had some employees that said they haven't been in all hands in ages.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.400]   A lot of people are saying, "It's not going to change much.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:58.160]   Sundar Pichai, who was CEO of Google, will now be the CEO of Alphabet.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   He'll take over running the big umbrella company.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.360]   Larry and Sergey will stay on the board and of course still have the majority
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.320]   voting stock.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.040]   If they don't like something, they can even get rid of the board.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.120]   They have that much power.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.120]   I don't know how much this is going to change Google.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.120]   What do you think, Amy?
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.520]   Is this a transition that we should pay attention to?
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:27.200]   No, I just echo what you said, which is, I think, every company as it grows, and especially
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   very successful companies, at some point, go through a series of management changes.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.440]   That typically includes the founders of those companies.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.520]   I don't think what's happening now is really outside of the realm of what would be normal.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:46.960]   I think the questions that I would have are, this company has gotten very big and there's
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.640]   not a single AI.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.400]   For example, with artificial intelligence, there's not one division.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:58.920]   There's a couple of different divisions and with a horizontal structure that doesn't entirely
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.560]   connect the two.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:06.880]   There are divisions that you could think of as almost orphans because there's not a lot
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:12.240]   of knowledge sharing between the different parts of the organization.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:19.600]   I wonder if with Sundar moving up and them moving out, if there'll be a more streamlined
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.520]   structure going forward, which would do nothing but help the organization, I would think.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.640]   There's a certain analogy to Microsoft.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.320]   It's in its third era now.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.480]   You had Gates, you had Ballmer, and for the last five and a half years, such in Adela,
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.800]   Google is now entering its third phase.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.520]   It was a big change for Microsoft.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.200]   Christina, do you think it's going to be a big change for Google?
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:50.120]   I think this would be more akin to, I guess, maybe when Ballmer took over from Bill Gates.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.920]   Business as usual.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:56.840]   I think that because Gates was still involved, he was on the board.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.880]   He wasn't maybe doing day to day things, but he was still involved in parts of the business
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.880]   and whatnot.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.080]   Then towards the end of his tenure, I think there were some differences.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:09.880]   But obviously, there's been a much bigger cultural and business shift as Sausia took
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.440]   over succeeded Ballmer.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:18.880]   I think that in this case, I think what's interesting is my first question was, "Okay,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.520]   if Sundar is taking over Alphabet, why does Alphabet still exist?
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.400]   Why are we still doing the shell company thing?"
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.880]   To me, that's still unclear.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.760]   I can understand if you want to have these sub-companies, I guess.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:35.800]   You're putting everything under, if Google is under the auspices of One Guy and that
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:42.120]   guy is also controlling Alphabet, to me, the whole point of Alphabet had seemed to be like,
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:47.120]   "Okay, we have this one kind of grander CEO of all these things, and then we have these
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.240]   individual leaders of these different divisions."
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:54.000]   If you have One Guy who's the head of everything and he's also the head of the day to day for
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.840]   the largest division, I don't see a point in having this shell thing.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.960]   Instead, you should put all the other divisions underneath Google.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:03.960]   I don't know.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   This was, I think, more of an operational versus a shell company shift.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:16.680]   If you look at Microsoft over the past several decades, there hasn't been a lot of stray
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:23.560]   from core competency, so operating system, cloud, and the various sundry services that
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.880]   go along with that.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:30.680]   Part of what was happening at Google over the past decade was launching into self-driving
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   car.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   No, I hear you.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   I hear you, I hear you.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.320]   I see interfaces, healthcare, and I don't disagree with that.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.900]   I guess my point is, if you have the same person who's in charge of all of these things,
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:45.320]   is going to be saying, "Okay, this is the CEO of the big, you know, Ospus thing," but
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:51.600]   he's also in charge of Google, which contains lots of things, some of which intersect with
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.160]   these other areas, some of which which don't.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.720]   Amazon is set up in a similar way, right?
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.360]   You've got Amazon, the corporation with Bezos at the top.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:05.400]   You have Amazon.com, which quite frankly is a teeny, tiny portion of the large, I mean,
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.000]   important portion of it, but it's not the entirety of Amazon.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.800]   It's the biggest instance in charge of AWS.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   He's in charge.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.120]   That's Jassy, right? I'm saying Sundar is in charge of Google and he's in charge of
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.120]   Alphabet.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:23.000]   My assumption is that they'll be making more structural changes.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.640]   They just haven't announced them yet.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.760]   Here's what I wonder.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.920]   It feels like all of those other bets, Verily and the health sciences and Loon and Google
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.240]   fiber and all these, it feels like all these other bets, almost all of which are money
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.760]   losers, were protected by Larry.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.440]   Larry and Sergey, they-
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.240]   That's partially why Alphabet was formed.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   Right.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.680]   Funnel profits from Google into money losing other bets.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.680]   I don't see it that high.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.680]   They needed other bets.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.000]   As Apple needs its other bets, I bet Microsoft is doing the same thing.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.680]   Microsoft is in a better position than Apple or Google, but I think both Apple and Google
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:08.000]   are looking at a future that doesn't include Google search or whatever.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.640]   They're trying to figure out what's the next thing.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.640]   This is basic research.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   You got it too, right?
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   This is not unusual.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:20.480]   Just for context, for a big technology or science company, this is not- if you look
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:29.200]   at a Bose, for example, or a Bell Labs long time ago, an important component of their
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.160]   work was basic research.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.960]   It's just that you didn't tend to historically hear about that basic research until there
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.360]   was something to show for it.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.400]   We saw a lot of good come out of Bell Labs, but I don't know if it was a lot of good to
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:44.040]   benefit AT&T, and they eventually sold it, became loosened, they got sold again.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.840]   I don't know how valuable-
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.560]   No, I think it was.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.160]   I think AT&T was split up by the government.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.160]   And they had it.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.160]   They had it.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.160]   Honestly, that hadn't happened because they had Unix.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.160]   They had all kinds of other things.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.800]   They had a lot of video to laugh at me.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.600]   They had so much stuff that if the baby bells hadn't been split up, that's a very different
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   scenario.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.920]   I mean, now they basically come back together, but that's a very different scenario.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.560]   I mean, to Amy's point, I mean, Google obviously has many research divisions at Microsoft
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.560]   with Microsoft research.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.520]   Amazon has their areas.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.520]   And that's a problem.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   That's a problem.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.520]   It exists.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.520]   Why is it a problem?
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.720]   A problem at Microsoft.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:23.080]   So some of the best machine reading comprehension code that I've seen has come out of Microsoft.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.040]   The problem with all of these enormous companies is that you have the researchers doing their
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.520]   basic research or their difficult research.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:35.520]   You have a product team that's charged with trying to commercialize as soon as humanly
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.600]   possible, and you don't have an intermediary thinking about the longer term opportunities,
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.600]   risk, and implications.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:48.760]   So sometimes some of this amazing research winds up not making it outside of the research
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.760]   division.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.800]   And then a long time after that, we all look back and say, well, this was a giant waste
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.200]   of time and didn't provide shareholder value.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:03.960]   So I wonder if part of what's happening at Google/AlphaBET is a forthcoming reorg that
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:10.120]   will help bridge some of the divide between the pure research divisions and some of the
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.640]   other operations in a way that doesn't force commercialization too soon, because that's
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:19.840]   an easy way for Google to miss the mark on analyst reports and to create crappy products
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   and all the rest of it.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.280]   Understanding that both of you have a much better insight into these companies than I
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   do.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.200]   I'm sitting outside looking in with no understanding of what their plans are, their goals.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.320]   But the way it looks sometimes for people looking in is you have a CFO Ruth Porat who
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:42.160]   has been very aggressive about killing non-profitable arms of the enterprise.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.440]   She's the alphabet CFO, not Google.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.800]   You've had, I think, it feels like Larry and Sergey saying, not this one Ruth, not
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.680]   this one, but you can kill that.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.640]   With them kind of dialed out more of the picture, you've got Sundar Pachai, who, by
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.400]   the way, I have huge respect for.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.480]   He's a good operational guy.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.680]   But I wonder if the combination of Sundar Pachai and Ruth Porat takes Google a little
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:12.000]   bit away from its blue sky and a little bit more towards its bread and butter.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.200]   So this is a problem because, so I'm a quantitative futurist and most of what I do when I'm not
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:21.160]   researching is management consulting and I deal with huge enormous organizations.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.160]   That's what I mean.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.000]   You have a better insight into this tonight.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   So I'm posing you this conundrum.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.440]   It's okay to say you're full of it, Leo.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.440]   You have no idea what it's like in business.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.520]   No, no, but in full disclosure, I have advised Microsoft.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.520]   I haven't in the past several months, but I have.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.600]   So let me say this.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:44.200]   We don't have a blueprint that represents the kind of companies that are in the process
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.200]   of evolving.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.720]   And we don't have a template for the ecosystems in which they're operating.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.720]   And so that really isn't-
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.800]   You can't look at somebody like Ford or Toyota.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.240]   You can't look at there's no industrial era company that's in an intellectual.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.240]   I don't think so.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:01.920]   I think that using the industrial revolution as a shorthand to describe what's happening
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.920]   right now-
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.240]   It's not even close.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   It's really not.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:13.280]   And so we haven't had- If you look at some of America's former mega companies like a Ford,
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:18.640]   for example, they were producing a fairly narrow type of product and they were building
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.760]   a market and they were changing the world, but they were doing it in a limited way in
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.240]   a tangible way.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:30.480]   These new companies are predicated on data and the way that those data are collected,
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:40.360]   mined, refined, optimized, used, and the various products, whether it's wet hardware or cloud-based
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:46.920]   or pretty soon wetware as they start to move into health and new types of human interfaces
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.480]   that meld with machines.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:55.520]   All of this presents a new kind of management challenge that we just haven't had before.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.480]   And therefore it means new management.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:03.560]   I mean, one of the things that I'm noticing is we have a lot of people who are elevating
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.520]   through the ranks of these companies.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:09.680]   I think we probably need some kind of new way to train the people who are managing these
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.440]   kinds of companies because you can't just make-
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:19.200]   It might be a short-term benefit to Nix Verily, for example, or whatever other projects they're
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:23.480]   working on at great long-term cost.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:31.080]   So the kinds of ancillary work that all these folks are doing is not the kind of research
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.760]   that's going to turn a profit in the next couple of years.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.480]   So there's whole new kinds of management challenges that we've just never had before
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:45.680]   and you can't look at managers from the past or like Ray Dalio is somebody who I think
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.120]   is incredibly smart and usually very, very smart on this kind of stuff.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.760]   And he's been writing a little bit about this in different places.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:56.680]   It's a, you know, this is a problem that's going to be-
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.440]   That Google is going to have to contend with going forward.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.200]   Amazon has been very secretive.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.680]   Bezos just added how many people to their executive group?
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680]   22.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.680]   Holy.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   22, I believe it was.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:17.640]   I think the signals to me that there's management challenges that we're starting to see unfold.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.640]   Adding more people doesn't-
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.640]   No, no, people doesn't.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   Has anybody who's ever worked in software design knows?
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.080]   It's like saying, well-
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   Oh, no, sorry.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.080]   It's now up to 22.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.080]   He added six.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.080]   Sorry.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.080]   Sorry.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.520]   If one person can deliver a baby in nine months, maybe if I have nine people, they can deliver
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.880]   nine babies in nine months.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.880]   It's not quite-
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.800]   Or one baby per month.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.800]   It doesn't quite work out that way.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   And I also have to wonder-
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.800]   But it is hard.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.800]   It is hard.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.800]   No, I understand.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.760]   In general, my sense, at least in technology, is that the incumbents, it's the innovators
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:57.080]   dilemma, have a very, very, very difficult time pivoting to the next big thing.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:02.080]   And at least until now, the next big thing's always come from some unexpected place.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:07.280]   It's easier to pivot and follow somebody else's lead to the next big thing.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.680]   It's much harder when you wear the pivot and you have to make decisions about the direction
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.680]   of the organization.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   And I wonder how much they-
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.680]   Yeah, I wonder how much they-
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:16.680]   They take a group of organizations.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.240]   These blue sky research labs like Microsoft's or Bell Labs, which is by the way, now and
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.240]   by Nokia.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.280]   Good luck, Nokia.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.840]   Or Google's X and other bets.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:34.120]   I wonder what historically, how important these blue sky research facilities have been to companies,
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.680]   whether they really did make a difference.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.680]   I know it didn't help Xerox classically.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.640]   Xerox invented the future and-
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.520]   And so did you speak PODAC.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.520]   This is the problem.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.520]   PODAC.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.520]   Right.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.520]   They invented the digital camera and they didn't know what to do.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.520]   What to do with it.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.520]   So historically, this is tough.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.000]   This is- and that's what I'm talking about.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.640]   You have- Microsoft has absolutely like top tier brilliant researchers.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:05.800]   This is a management challenge and it afflicts every one of these big companies because there's
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:11.400]   a tension between getting something to market to a P shareholders.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.520]   Shareholders by the way do not like R&D investments because they're not revenue generating.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.920]   Amazon got spanked somewhat recently because they revealed the amount that they were spending
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.200]   on R&D and shareholders did not like that.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.600]   And I kind of am like, well, what the hell do you think is going to earn your revenue?
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.480]   Where do you think the future value is coming from?
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.960]   If these folks aren't doing R&D, then they're going to take six years to make a computer
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.040]   that basically nobody wants Apple.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.040]   Hashtag.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.800]   I does anybody want the cheese.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.360]   Or a phone that nobody buys.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]   Amazon.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360]   Or a phone that nobody buys.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.720]   So, you know, and that's another great example.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.440]   We built a model at- you know, I built a model a couple years ago showing that it was
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.920]   the beginning of the end of cell phones and that model has borne out.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:00.520]   And at the time, every analyst on the street looked at our research who was even looking
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.840]   at it and was like, you know, they don't know what they're talking about because sometimes
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.680]   our hopes and desires for the future don't mesh well with reality.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.640]   And reality is you have to invest.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   You have to do that R&D, but you also have to do it in a way that bridges the research
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.880]   into the product and the area where value is derived in that's management.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:28.480]   And my point is, right, so I wonder if in this new structure, if what's being set up
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   at Alphabet is a way to better bridge the gap between the really smart people working
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.760]   on critical gnarly problems and the people who would monetize.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:45.800]   That would be a prudent thing to do is to figure out a pathway from the blue sky to
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.600]   the basics.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.360]   Take a break and we're going to come back with more of this amazing duo.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.600]   But first a word from worldwide technology and their advanced technology center.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.440]   By the way, some good news were going out there and March we're going to do an event
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.440]   in St. Louis.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.120]   More details coming up.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.880]   WWT began building this ATC about 10 years ago.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.880]   They built it initially for their own engineers and they stocked it with more than half a
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:18.440]   billion dollars in enterprise equipment from hundreds of OEMs, key partners ranging from
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:25.280]   the big guys like NetApp and Cisco and VMware to emerging disruptors, Tanium, Equinix,
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280]   Expanse.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:31.000]   Inside there half a billion dollars a gear and the engineers use it to spin up pilots,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.960]   proof of concept, to create setups for their clients.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:41.440]   It's an amazing, valuable system for WWT, but I also have to point out it could be an
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.960]   amazing, valuable system for you too.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:52.920]   It is an incubator for IT innovation and with on-demand labs, scheduleable labs, you can
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.080]   participate too.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.160]   Things like NetApp Cloud Volumes on tap on tap on flash, NetApp Disaster Recovery as a
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:04.560]   service, hundreds of other labs representing the latest and greatest in everything from
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:10.440]   flash storage, multi-cloud, hyper converged infrastructure, cloud data management.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:16.320]   It is a place where you can go, they call it lab as a service, is a dedicated lab space
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:22.600]   within the ATC where you can perform your own programmatic testing just like the engineers
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:28.080]   at WWT2 using this vast technology ecosystem that they've already built in their half
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.160]   a billion dollars with the enterprise gear.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.400]   Because it's virtual, you can use it 24/7 anywhere in the world.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   Is that not awesome?
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400]   You don't have to go to St. Louis.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.400]   We are going to go to St. Louis.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.440]   I can't wait to see the lab.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:46.640]   This new digital platform encompasses the entire ecosystem at the ATC.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.200]   It's a multiplier effect of knowledge, speed, agility, anytime, anywhere around the world
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.040]   for their customers.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.600]   You'll get access to not just the labs but articles, case studies, other tools that make
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.480]   the difference in today's fast paced world.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.960]   It's a tough world when you're putting your business on the line with enterprise technology.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.760]   It's sure nice to know it's going to work ahead of time and that's what it's all about
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.320]   at WWT.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:14.080]   To learn more about WWT, the ATC and sign up for access to their new on demand lab platform
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.440]   at www.www.wet.com/twit.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:25.440]   WWT Worldwide Technology simplifies the complex at www.wet.com/twit.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.840]   WWT delivering business and technology outcomes around the world.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.840]   I can't wait.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.760]   In March, we'll give you more details soon but in March, we're going to be going out
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.520]   there.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.920]   It's going to be a really interesting event out there.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.920]   They're all invited.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:45.240]   Google and everybody else are like, these guys are like captains of a ship that's burning.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.600]   They're building the lifeboats as quickly as they can.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   That's a good analogy.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.440]   I have to point out there is a massive storm on the horizon and that's government regulation.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.880]   It's really interesting that Larry and Sergey both said, "Okay, you guys take it over."
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:04.400]   At the very moment that Google is under all sorts of investigation, their employees are
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:09.680]   billing, there are lots of challenges that have nothing to do with can you make a better
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.280]   search engine or a self-driving vehicle.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:18.320]   Let me ask Christina about this so we can balance it out.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.960]   How worried should these companies be about government intervention?
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.760]   Is this all just political bluster or is the next president going to say, "Google, you've
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.560]   got to get rid of YouTube."
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:38.360]   I think it would be great if there was more sensible and focused.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.680]   Maybe the government was looking at things in a sensible and valid way to say, has there
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.400]   been overreach and are there things that maybe these companies are doing too much that we
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.400]   should step in.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.520]   At the same time, I personally think a lot of it is just political bluster.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:56.400]   I'm very hesitant just because of looking at everything that's happened in the past,
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.280]   that every attempt anybody who said that we will regulate these things has ended up not
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.280]   doing it.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.800]   In fact, the trend over the last 30, 40 years, no matter what administration has been in power,
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.000]   no matter who's been in charge of Congress, has been about deregulation rather than adding
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.200]   more regulations.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:18.720]   I'm actually not in any way hopeful that there will be any sort of government stepping in
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.720]   any meaningful way.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:23.880]   That's interesting that you put it that way, Christina.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.800]   You would like to see maybe some government intervention and regulation?
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.680]   I would like if it was done in a smart way and in a focused way.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.920]   Yeah, I think that there would be in some cases definitely, especially around data usage
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.120]   and privacy.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.040]   I think that, yes, I think that there are problems.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.440]   The European Union has done a really good job in some cases, in some cases, in some
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.720]   cases, like right to be forgotten.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.880]   I think they've gone too far, but in other ways, I think they've actually actually taken
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.120]   the reins and have done some important things to at least try to rein some things in.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:57.520]   But right now, even though I support a lot of the candidates who talk about regulating
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:03.000]   tech, I roll my eyes, if I'm being completely honest, because I don't think that it's going
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.960]   to happen and it's especially not going to happen that they say that it is.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.120]   I've got to point out, though, that you work for a company that's already saying, "We're
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.160]   going to do what California tells us to do," because the new California Privacy Act goes
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.120]   in effect January 1st.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.120]   Right.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.920]   I mean, as most companies, I think, is not going to just do what California says in
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.520]   California, but it's going to do it nationwide.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   No, of course not.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.560]   I mean, similar with GDPR, if you have to go through the process of rolling those things
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:33.760]   out, it makes sense to try to do it as broadly as you can, because if it's a very difficult
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.800]   process to have, "Okay, we're only going to follow these laws or these rules in these
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.800]   locations."
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.360]   I get that, and I'm a fan of adhering to these regulations, if they make sense.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:49.200]   I'm just saying, from a cynical standpoint, I don't really have a lot of faith that government
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:56.000]   regulation will come from the house or from any of the branches, the executive branch,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.040]   to actually make a big impact.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.360]   I would say, although it's interesting timing with Larry and Sergey leaving when this thing
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:11.720]   might be happening, to me, Occam's Razor is a little bit more applicable, in which case,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.040]   there are billionaires many, many times over.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:18.440]   They're probably tired of dealing with a lot of the yes and the minutiae that is going
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.600]   on with having to do the day-to-day things.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.720]   Natasha Tiko's amazing article for Wired that came out a few months ago about the last
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:30.640]   three years at Google, if that was what I was having to contend with as somebody who
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.960]   is being seen as the top person in charge, and I don't have to do that, and I'm in a
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:41.080]   position where I can still have to say over who is and who isn't on the board, and if
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:46.920]   I really need to step in and make changes, I can, but I'm a billionaire many times over
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.000]   and I've been doing this for 20 plus years.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.400]   Yeah, I'm going to go live on my yacht and do my own stuff too.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.400]   I mean, why not?
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.440]   As they say, Larry and Sergey are retiring to spend more time with their money.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.000]   Amy Webb, what do you think about, I mean, honestly, you can listen to these promises
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.160]   from Bernie and Elizabeth Warren and Go, "Well, that's all nice, but don't forget, the president
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.680]   doesn't get to, it's not a dictator that you've got Congress to deal with."
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.760]   Seems unlikely that a lot of these things they're promising will happen.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.080]   Bernie just said something I thought was great.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.600]   He said high-speed internet should be a right in this country.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.120]   Couldn't agree with him more, but I doubt very much that we have such, at this point,
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.360]   our government is so broken.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.360]   I can't expect it.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.960]   I don't expect it to do anything.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.960]   Well, I don't know that it's, let me, if you're going to defend Apple tonight, I guess
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.960]   I will defend the government.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.960]   Please defend the government.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   Somebody's got to.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.280]   But let me first say, I believe very strongly in public service.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.160]   We don't really have a culture of public service in the US.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.320]   And I donate about 20% of my professional time back to public initiatives.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Thank you.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   I agree.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   That's the point.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.760]   So, a couple of those initiatives have to do with policy.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:04.400]   So, a strange, like I'm the person that's constantly talking about data and privacy.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:09.280]   And so, this is going to probably sound very strange, but I'm actually not in favor of
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.760]   regulation in this case.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:18.120]   The way that the structures of our government currently works and the levers that we have,
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:26.040]   the power, our democracy, the regulatory framework would make it impossible.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.240]   There are larger forces at play.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.480]   And talk about not even industrial era.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.640]   This is agrarian era, the constitution, right?
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.120]   So, here's the problem.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.640]   The problem is that self-policing doesn't work.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   Right?
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.880]   That's, we'll agree on that.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:50.440]   Our existing regulatory framework doesn't make sense in an era in which the evolution
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:55.880]   of the thing that we're trying to regulate is going to span the next couple of decades.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880]   Right.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.240]   So, and we have China and to a lesser extent, Russia to contend with, and they're not
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.520]   playing by the same rules.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.520]   So, right?
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.520]   That's a really interesting one.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.480]   And they seem to be almost teaming up at this point.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480]   Right.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.760]   I'm not in favor of traditional regulation.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:20.000]   I am, however, I do think that we have passed the point of no return and we have to do something.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.160]   So, I was at the Senate a couple of weeks ago proposing a national office of strategic
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.880]   foresight and I, the paper is online.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.480]   I just put it in the, that's it.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.880]   And part of what, there is no, there is no solution.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:43.720]   Even the regulatory frameworks that Warren and Bernie are proposing are going to wind
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.200]   up in court for the next decade.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.760]   So, there's no easy fix.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:53.920]   And I believe it's smarter to incentivize all of these companies to prioritize shareholder
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.880]   value over stakeholder value.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:01.240]   And there's a way to do that without, you know, they're still publicly traded companies
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.360]   and they have to turn up, they have to serve their shareholders.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.920]   But I think that this can be done using different types of incentives.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:13.800]   So I've been talking a lot to lawmakers about this and the office would be non-political
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.080]   and that, and it would be charged with doing long range planning and building all kinds
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:24.280]   of public private partnerships and putting data and AI and other kinds of technologies
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.200]   and classifying them as public goods.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.680]   So, instead of regulation, you'd say incentives?
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.680]   I would say leadership.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680]   Leadership would be nice.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.520]   Yeah, that would be nice.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.800]   And part of that leadership is taking a much longer view.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.400]   The benefit of democracy is you don't like who's in office, you vote them out in a couple
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.400]   of years.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.400]   The drawback, of course, is that this makes it very easy for science and technology to
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.720]   be politicized.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:56.560]   And so, you know, we're kind of at a point where having political arguments about tech
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.360]   is not in our best interests.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.920]   What would be in our best interests is to figure out ways to get everybody to collaborate.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:09.720]   So that paper, excuse me, was just at, I showed that to the Senate.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.920]   I've been on talking to people about it.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.640]   I also wrote one and proposed it at the, I did not send you guys that link, but I was
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.800]   at the UN in Vienna two weeks ago talking to them about something similar but on a more
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.880]   global scale.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:31.720]   But these are not politically, these are ideas that are so different from what we would,
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:37.320]   how we would normally broach and approach these problems that I'm, you know, I'm not
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.920]   seeing as tracking traction as quickly as I'd like.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.560]   >> But sometimes you'd need radical solutions because we have radical issues.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.800]   We have dramatic and different issues.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.120]   >> Yeah, they're a radical thing here.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.400]   The radical thing is that the solution, I think, is collaboration.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.160]   >> No, I was going to say that.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:58.920]   It was like the radical thing is it's collaborating, which is, I'm in full agreement with you.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.400]   I support your initiative 100%.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.000]   I hope that it can get traction.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.320]   I think it's difficult, unfortunately, with how politicized everything is on both sides,
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.800]   sometimes to get to that collaboration point, right?
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   >> Wow.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.960]   I feel guilty about wasting your time here on the show you two.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.240]   I think you both should get back to your much more important things.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.600]   >> How could I do more?
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.600]   >> Amy does.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.600]   I don't have anything more important.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.720]   >> So somebody on the IRC mentioned the Office of Technology Assessment.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.600]   >> That's so sad that we lost that.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.600]   That's so sad.
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.600]   >> Is that there's a goal?
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.000]   >> Killed in the '90s by Newt Gingrich.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   >> Yeah, it was.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.800]   It was killed after his contract on America, which was kind of like for America, but I
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.360]   think it's probably a better preposition.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.360]   Okay.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:50.240]   >> What's interesting is that this Office became the gold standard all around the world.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.240]   It's fascinating.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.960]   It's like we have such incredible brain power.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.520]   I know everybody likes to rag on the federal government, but I know some really, really
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.120]   sharp people who have dedicated their, who could make up way more money on, in outside,
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.000]   but have dedicated their lives to public services.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   >> Look at Mac Cuts.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   >> They sleep.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   >> Look at Mac Cuts.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   >> Totally.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   >> You missed a great example.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   >> Absolutely.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   >> Absolutely.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.400]   >> Actually, you think government is filled with people like that.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.400]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.840]   People love to make fun of, but it's, Mac Cuts is there.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.640]   I mean, I could rattle off the names of many, many, many people.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.440]   >> I have a number of friends who've taken, like, sabbaticals from big tech companies
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:33.480]   and then do like an 18 month or 24 month, you know, like 10 year at, you know, various,
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.480]   various parts of the government.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:39.120]   >> It's just as you were saying that Microsoft and other big companies are not monolithic.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.560]   They're filled with great people with great motives.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560]   Government too.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.800]   You know, we only see a part of it, the tip of the iceberg, but what keeps the government
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:52.560]   running is some very dedicated, hardworking civil servants whose chief interest is in
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:57.280]   the United States, not in personal, you know.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.200]   >> The government, interestingly though, faces the same problem that a lot of these companies
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:09.920]   do, which is that at some point, the pace and the rate of change in tech and science
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:17.200]   is just moving so much faster than your ability to legislate or govern or manage.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:21.080]   And so that's the thing going forward that I think everybody's going to have to contend
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.080]   with, which again is why I'm kind of interested to see what Brad Smith is doing at Microsoft
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:31.400]   and what the changes might be there and what Sundar Pichai will do at Google and, you know,
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:39.640]   and Apple, I'm sorry, Google and Alphabet and why Jeff Bezos is such a compelling leader
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.560]   because nobody knows what's going on in Amazon.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:48.840]   >> Oh, the irony right is that, you know, there, which I love actually, I'm kind of
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.000]   of the obvious of this, they're very like right down everything culture where everyone
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   writes everything down.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.880]   So there's got to be mass, but yet they do a really good job of, I guess, preventing
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:01.720]   leaks because none of that, none of those are getting out, which is kind of, it really
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:06.240]   is, right, because literally this is a company where, as their executives, they write everything
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:11.560]   down and are very memo driven, which I think is fantastic, but we never see any of that.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.080]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.560]   >> Let's take a little break.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:19.680]   >> Any web is here, her new book is, or latest book is the, well, actually, you're always
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.680]   writing new books.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.240]   >> I'm always, I'm on a new one now, but I'm right now.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:29.360]   >> The big nine is the one to get for now and then you can go out and get the new one
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.400]   and we'll have you, of course, on triangulation.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.440]   Can you tell us what it's about?
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.200]   >> I cannot, but it's very excited about it.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.960]   >> Keep it secret.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.960]   But you can still get the big nine all about the batfangs or whatever they're called.
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   >> G-mop, G-mop, yeah.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   >> G-mop, yeah.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.960]   How the potential- >> I like batfangs better, I think that's
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   the best thing.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   >> The batfangs.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.520]   >> Yeah, what is that?
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.360]   >> I do Alibaba Tencent, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.560]   >> Apple, it kind of works.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.560]   >> Google, it almost works.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.560]   >> That's fang.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.560]   >> I think it works out there.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.560]   >> Yeah, fang would get.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.520]   >> The fangs.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:13.160]   The big nine, how the tech titans in their thinking machines could warp humanity.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.720]   It's also wonderful to have film girl on Christina Warren.
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.800]   You make me just want to talk about TV and movies and forget all this hard stuff.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.560]   >> I mean, can we do that?
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.920]   Because like that's- >> Yeah, I'd much rather to be honest with
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920]   you.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.920]   Have you been watching Watchmen?
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.920]   >> I have.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.920]   >> What do you think?
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.920]   >> I like it.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.920]   >> It's so weird.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920]   >> I haven't started it yet.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.320]   >> I can't figure it out.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.920]   So I never saw the movie and I haven't read the comic book.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:38.920]   >> Did you read the book?
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.920]   >> I ordered the book- >> That's my favorite comic book of all time.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.920]   >> Yeah, everybody agrees.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.920]   >> My favorite comic.
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.680]   The greatest graphic novel of all time.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.360]   In fact, some people say one of the best novels of all time.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360]   So I bought it.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.360]   >> And it still holds up.
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.440]   >> Yeah, well I'm reading it now so that I can understand what the hell is going on
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:54.440]   in the show.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.040]   >> Alan Moore apparently was not.
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:00.040]   He didn't say anything when the remake, when the new version was happening and then he
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.080]   publicly came out pretty recently, like not thrilled at all.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.160]   >> Well, it's a sequel.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.400]   It's ten years later.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.400]   >> Alan Moore is Alan Moore.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.160]   >> He's a totally different- >> It's a different.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.120]   It's the same universe.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.280]   It's the same title.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.480]   >> It's still got Ozymandias in it.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.960]   I mean, there's still squids, but it's the future.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.720]   >> I guess there's a bunch of Rorschach masks.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.280]   >> There's Rorschach masks.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.640]   I don't know if Rorschach's around.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.920]   Anyway, I like it.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.920]   It's very weird.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.000]   >> I'm actually- >> I'm actually on the morning show.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   I have to be honest.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   >> Are you?
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.560]   See, you like that kind of stuff, the touchy-feely stuff.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.600]   >> I made a tactical error with my nine-year-old.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.640]   >> Oh, I haven't watched this weeks yet.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.640]   I will.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:46.640]   I have to admit, as I've watched it, I've gotten more and more engrossed by it.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.720]   It started out, I did not like it because it was too fake- >> This is the morning show?
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:53.000]   >> What's the deal you made with your nine-year-old?
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.240]   >> I last night thought, "Hey, let's watch Dune."
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.440]   >> That's a bad idea.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.440]   >> Oh, that's her one.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.440]   >> Let's read Dune.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.440]   >> Dune.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:09.120]   >> She was obsessed with Virginia Madsen at the beginning and the spice menage.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:13.160]   So she's all into it, and then I forgot about this.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:16.240]   I shouldn't be spoiling this for anybody, but I forgot about the sand.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.240]   I forgot.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.240]   I forgot, "Oh, that's right.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.920]   This is maybe not appropriate for my nine-year-old kid before bedtime."
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.320]   >> I'm trying to remember.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:26.200]   It's a little, it's a little scary.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.360]   >> It's her- >> I mean, it's David Lynch.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   >> David Lynch, exactly.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   >> I love David Lynch.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.360]   But, yeah, I do.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.160]   >> It's like I've attacked, not my best moment in parenting.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.160]   I'll be honest.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.760]   >> Sting is Baron Harkonin.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:37.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.520]   >> No, he's not Baron Harkonin.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   He's the son of Baron Harkonin.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.720]   >> They're making a whole new, so that's another remake that's coming out with that.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.320]   >> I see that so many times.
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.960]   >> I think it's an unmakeable.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.440]   There are science fiction books.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:53.680]   Cannot be made, and Ringworld is one, and that one is another one.
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.680]   You just can't do it.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:55.680]   >> I think I agree with you.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.000]   I mean, people have tried and failed.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.200]   But Watchmen, interesting.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.200]   All right.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.200]   >> All right.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.000]   >> And the morning show, I'm going to watch a little more.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.680]   >> Yeah, the latest episode this week, it's actually very difficult to watch.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.080]   But it's a very, very, very good hour television.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.320]   >> You're of the friends generation.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.440]   >> But I'm not even talking about that.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.800]   >> I watch Jennifer Aniston and I go, what's the deal with Jennifer Aniston?
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.760]   >> Have you guys ever watched Friends Without the Laugh track?
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.760]   >> Yes.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.760]   >> It's so eerie.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.760]   Yes, I love that.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   It's just so too epic.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.240]   >> It's really bad without the laugh track.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.240]   >> It's not.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.240]   >> Big bang theory.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.240]   >> Yes.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.520]   >> That's a show that I watch when I have insomnia.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.000]   It helps me go to sleep.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.480]   >> Right, totally.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:42.440]   No, but I think Jennifer Aniston is fine in it.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.840]   I think Reese Witherspoon is better.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.600]   But this week's episode is the last track.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.120]   >> Reese Witherspoon is fantastic in it, actually.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.880]   >> Yes, she's very, very good.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.120]   >> This is her show, yeah.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.120]   >> Totally.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.480]   I think that she's, I thought that everybody gave Nicole Kidman so much credit for her
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.280]   pretty little eyes.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:02.120]   And Nicole Kidman was great, but I always thought Reese was just perfect in that.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:06.120]   >> Right, but I've been a Reese fan since I was like seven years old and I saw The Man
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.920]   in the Moon, which was the first movie she was in.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.880]   So good movie too, actually.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.440]   But- >> Is that the Andy Kaufman one?
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.600]   >> No, no, it's different.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.520]   It was a coming of age film.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.880]   It was like a very small film.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:23.520]   It came out in 1991 and my older sister wanted to see it for some reason and we rented it
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.880]   from the video store.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.400]   And both of us have been fans of hers since then.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.400]   >> She's really good.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400]   >> I have to agree.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.400]   >> She's really good.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:50.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:54.400]   >> She's really good at the show.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.400]   >> She's really good at the show.

[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:40.400]   >> The future of war is not a billion Chinese marching into the United States.
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:44.400]   We are, by our very nature, pretty difficult to evade and conquer.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.400]   That's not what we should be preparing for.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:49.400]   That's not the kind of warfare we're going to see in the future.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:53.400]   >> I mean, listen, I was just at the Pentagon last week.
[01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:59.400]   So we have incredibly smart people working in our military and in our government.
[01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:06.400]   My concern is that the Federal Reserve, which is our central bank, is not preparing for a future
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:09.400]   in which a big tech company starts trading on its proprietary data.
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:12.400]   And I don't think that that is a technique that would run a foul of our current regular trade.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.400]   >> How would you prepare for that?
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:14.400]   What do you mean they should?
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:16.400]   >> You do the long-term planning.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:21.400]   And similarly, if China builds this coalition, everybody knows about the social credit score,
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:24.400]   which is super like black mirror and dystopian.
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:28.400]   Nobody's talking about the corporate version of that, which has already been rolled out.
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:35.400]   So what happens if an American, not a big huge tech company, but like all of the small companies
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:41.400]   that power our economy, that require on goods and services and parts from China,
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:45.400]   are suddenly locked out, not because of a trade war, but because they don't have a social,
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:47.400]   they don't have a credit score.
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:48.400]   >> Right.
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:57.400]   >> That is a way, if China erects sort of a gigantic digital bamboo curtain that is
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:58.400]   interesting.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.400]   >> That's interesting.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:02.400]   >> That's not even saying it will be cyber warfare.
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.400]   It's pure economic warfare.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:04.400]   >> That's what I'm saying.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:09.400]   Like the future of war could be super boring and therefore much more lethal than we've ever
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:10.400]   imagined.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.400]   >> Yeah.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:12.400]   >> Right.
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.400]   And my concern is that we're not thinking about that.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:17.400]   We're not preparing for it as we should be.
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.400]   >> Yeah.
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.400]   Okay.
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:20.400]   That's a happy subject.
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:21.400]   Let's take a break.
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.400]   >> Well, it took two hours for me to go dystopian this time.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:24.400]   >> It wrecked your--
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:26.400]   >> Happy, happy subject.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.400]   No, this is why I brought it up.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:30.400]   I'm really interested in this.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:32.400]   And we are slowly converging on this.
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:37.400]   We've been talking about it with you for years, but it does seem like we're making gradual
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:39.400]   progress in this direction.
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.400]   And that's very interesting.
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:42.400]   Yeah.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.400]   Do you think we have a disadvantage as an open society compared to an authoritarian society?
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.400]   >> You know, I do.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:49.400]   And I'm certainly not--
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:52.400]   >> I still prefer to be an open society, you know?
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:57.400]   >> Absolutely.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:00.400]   I would far prefer to live in our democracy flawed as though it may be.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:05.400]   And China is committing atrocities against some of their ethnic minority populations.
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:07.400]   So there's horrible things happening.
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:08.400]   The problem is--
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:12.400]   >> And they're using technology, by the way, against these regraman, weger mandarities,
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:19.400]   for instance, requiring them to submit DNA, requiring them to everybody in China to use face recognition
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:22.400]   so they can collect the database of the entire country.
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:27.400]   >> Listen, I think probably people who have heard me before know that I'm Jewish,
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:29.400]   so it's not like a secret or anything.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.400]   I grew up-- I am old enough that I grew up with--
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:36.400]   I grew up around people who had numbers on their arms.
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:41.400]   So, you know, I grew up hearing vivid, horrible stories about concentration camps,
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.400]   and I will tell you that there are strong parallels between what I heard growing up
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:55.400]   and was exposed to and what I am seeing and what public reports are talking about.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:56.400]   >> That's right.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.400]   >> Yeah.
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:58.400]   >> And China and China.
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:59.400]   >> That's right.
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:00.400]   So that's not good.
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:05.400]   That being said, you could say, you know, China's at least somewhat transparent.
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:11.400]   We have a situation in the United States where there's not enough collaboration or transparency
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:19.400]   or accountability, you know, like forcing a company to pay a fine doesn't seem like
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.400]   we're really trying to work in what's best for the public interest.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:26.400]   >> Especially a fine that's a fraction of their total courtroom.
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:30.400]   >> Everybody in Europe, all the government agencies there love to talk about how they really
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:34.400]   brought the hammer down on Facebook, and I'm like, yeah, they wrote you a check and what behavior changed.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.400]   >> Mark Zuckerberg's cigarette money, you know, he's going to have to give up smokes for a month's big deal.
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:40.400]   >> Does he smoke?
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.400]   >> That's what makes it funny.
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.400]   >> Right.
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:44.400]   >> It's funny because it's not true.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:45.400]   >> Got it.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.400]   >> Let's, yeah, again, you made it even more dystopian.
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.400]   Thank you, Amy Webb.
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:58.400]   You know, we're moving rapidly into a world that no one understands or no one can even,
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.400]   I don't even know if you had an office of, you know, future policy assessment.
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:08.400]   I know you're a futurist, Amy, but how could you prepare for this kind of stuff?
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:09.400]   I don't know how you prepare for this kind of stuff.
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:13.400]   >> Well, that's, I don't have, listen, I'm as a futurist, I'll be the first person to tell you,
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:15.400]   I don't know what the future is going to be.
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:18.400]   All I can do is build a model, I can build several different models.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:25.400]   So that's why, if there's a way to untether politics, which I know is increasingly difficult to do,
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:32.400]   from policy and to decouple politics from tech, that's our best way forward.
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:38.400]   But we need a structure to do that, which is why I've been proposing this national office of strategic foresight,
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:47.400]   by the way, I don't want to run, I just want to see it happen, and smart people work there and lead.
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:50.400]   >> Yeah. Good luck.
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:57.400]   You know, like the office of technology assessment, which was nonpartisan, and the whole idea was,
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:01.400]   look, we're not going to make a partisan political judgment here, we're just going to tell you,
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:06.400]   fill you in on the technology so you can make your, you know, and leave it to the politicians to make the partisan
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:13.400]   politics judgments. They have to deal with politics, but these groups don't, and that's a good thing.
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:20.400]   Gosh, there's so much more to talk about. Let me take a break. I do want to talk about France's 100% tariffs
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:29.400]   on US goods, or no, US France saying we're going to tax big tech companies, and the US President of Trump's response,
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:39.400]   which is to put 100% tariff on my blue cheese, but first, a word from privacy.com.
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:45.400]   Well named in this day and age, and I am a huge fan of privacy.com. I've been using it for a very long time.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:53.400]   What privacy.com does is exactly what you want, which gives you a unique, brand new virtual Visa or MasterCard
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:06:00.400]   number for every purchase you make online. It's really easy. In fact, I have an extension running at Brave and Firefox Chrome
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:07.400]   Safari that lets you generate these, paste it right in, just as you would a regular credit card. But here's what's cool about
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:14.400]   this privacy card. As soon as you use it, it's tied to that merchant, can't be used anywhere else.
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:21.400]   Or you can say this is a one time use card, it can't be used anytime, anyway. You can set a total limit per charge,
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:28.400]   you can set a limit per year per month. You can freeze and unfreeze cards. I use privacy for all my subscriptions
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:34.400]   because frankly, I always forget to cancel them. But with privacy, there's just one user interface at privacy.com.
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:41.400]   I freeze that, freeze that, freeze that. And the subscription is over. It is incredible. Totally secure.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:47.400]   You don't use the same password on every site. I would presume. So why use the same credit card number when you shop online?
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:55.400]   It is a great way to protect yourself. And Android and iOS apps too. Now, I should tell you, it's not a charge card.
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:07:02.400]   It's not a credit card in the sense that it's not like that. It actually links to your US checking account or debit card.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:10.400]   So you pay it right away. It's not a way to kind of create a charge card. It's a way to buy things online in a safe, secure way.
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:16.400]   So you can spend the spending limits per charge per month per year, freeze and unfreeze cards. PCI DSS compliance.
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:23.400]   So it's exactly the same security standards as your bank. I love it too because when somebody tries to use a card that is assigned
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:29.400]   like on my Amazon card, if somebody else used it, I'd get a decline email and a push notification.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:34.400]   So I know that, hey, that card's been compromised. I can easily turn it off, put another card in there.
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:42.400]   Of course, it's strong encryption. In fact, they believe so much in privacy that they have a split key encryption system.
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:50.400]   Employees@privacy.com hold partial keys, separate employees, kind of like the two keys that the nuclear missile silo, right?
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:58.400]   So no one employee can decrypt. I use the person. Actually, I changed. I just changed. I was using for a long time the personal plan.
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:05.400]   That gives you 12 cards a month. All of those features. But they've launched two new paid versions. I immediately sign up for the pro version.
[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:13.400]   You pay $10 a month, but you get 36 cards a month. That's kind of enough for anybody unless you do a lot of Instagram buys.
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:19.400]   That's a lot of money. Plus, you get 1% cash back on all purchases. So it's a profit deal for me.
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:25.400]   I use privacy enough that I make more than the $10 a month. It costs. And you get additional security and privacy features.
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:33.400]   Now, if you're using it in a business, there's privacy for teams. $25 a month. You get 60 cards a month. Plus a dedicated account manager.
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:39.400]   You can have transaction limits tailored to your business needs so employees can't just go crazy. This is a really nice service.
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:47.400]   Free for personal use. I just want to say that. But if you are already using it as I am, I looked at the pro and I said,
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:50.400]   "Wait a minute. That's going to actually make me money because I can get the 1% cash back from."
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:57.400]   So that's, you know, and I've already made it. You know, it's not a lot of money. I can't remember how much it is, but like 10 or 15 bucks extra a month because of that.
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:05.400]   Privacy thinks you should have full control of your data. They have a webhook API so you could even create your own notifications.
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:09.400]   They support two factor. Of course, I use two factor with it as you should.
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:15.400]   Protect your privacy. Protect your money. Virtual cards from privacy.com. I'm such a fan.
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:21.400]   We want you to try it. If you go to privacy.com/twit, you'll get a $5 credit off your first purchase.
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:27.400]   And of course, if you're using privacy or look at pro or if you want to use it in a business, look at the team plan as well.
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:34.400]   That's a really good way to make it even more valuable. Privacy.com/twit. $5 credit towards your first purchase.
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:42.400]   It's all I use when I'm online. Oh, man, there's so much more to talk about. I wanted to talk about 5G, but if my God, that's another hour.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:46.400]   It's pretty amazing that we now need middleware to buy toilet paper.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:52.400]   It's not that amazing. If you think about it, the other thing I like about privacy, you can put any address.
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:59.400]   They don't mention this yet. You can put 123 Main Street, any town USA. You can make up a zip code. You don't have to use your name.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:04.400]   Service is incredible. It's more just like, I can't believe I need middleware.
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:09.400]   You can still go to your local CVS and pay cash.
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:13.400]   Yeah, but not in a lot of places. If you use your loyal, yeah, exactly.
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:20.400]   But also if you use your loyalty card so you can save, then unless you send the local CVS, those Amazon ghost stores are going to be everywhere.
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:25.400]   I imagine your neighborhood bodega, you'll just go. They are literally in my neighborhood.
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:28.400]   Of course, you're in Seattle. Exactly.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:35.400]   Yeah, there's a bunch of Amazon ghost stores that are in the process of launching in New York.
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:39.400]   I think they're going to roll those out everywhere. Is that like the future of grocery shopping?
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:45.400]   I don't think it's the future of grocery shopping. I think that they're trying to study computer vision at scale with people.
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:48.400]   I don't think it's a retail play.
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.400]   Yeah. So real interesting thing to license though.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.400]   Oh, interesting.
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.400]   It would be a really interesting opportunity.
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:59.400]   You get a lot of data from all those cameras and those stores.
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:03.400]   You can even see if somebody picked up an item, looked at it, put it down.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:09.400]   Why didn't they buy it? Don't you think pampers would like to know why you looked at the pampers and then bought the loves instead?
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:15.400]   I mean, that's valuable data. That's another way to make money and something to think about when you use this.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:21.400]   Good piece in ours, Technica, about 5G, kind of a 5G explainer.
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.400]   There's high band, mid band and low band, the millimeter wave 5G, which has got all sorts of problems.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:30.400]   And the reason I was interested, T-Mobile announced this week, there it is.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.400]   This is 5G's on the horizon. Here's what it is and what's coming.
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:36.400]   A great kind of tutorial, a primer on 5G.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:42.400]   But the reason I was interested is T-Mobile is saying we're launching 5G across the US, but it's the...
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:43.400]   5G.
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:47.400]   It's the low band, 600 megahertz.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.400]   Because the protocols are different, you still need to buy one of those 5G phones.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:52.400]   They're very limited supply.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.400]   Samsung and OnePlus phones will be available.
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:02.400]   And I'm assuming you'll have to sign up for a 5G plan, pay the extra fee.
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:04.400]   I don't know what it's going to cost.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:07.400]   And suffer the battery depletion that is inevitable.
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:12.400]   The OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren Edition is 900 bucks.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:17.400]   The Galaxy Note 10 plus 5G is 1300 bucks.
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:22.400]   I have an iPhone 11 that has 600 megahertz, but it won't work because it's a different protocol.
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.400]   And it's not faster.
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:28.400]   It's a millimeter wave is the one that's gigabit.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:34.400]   This will probably be best 100 megabits, which is honestly kind of what you get with a good LTE connection.
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:38.400]   So I'm not... I think 5G.
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.400]   Do you either... Do you want to say anything about that? Anybody wants to...
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:48.400]   I mean, I think it's not dissimilar to other than the millimeter waves, which obviously is a massive difference.
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.400]   Oh, God.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:54.400]   And obviously, what I mean from a technology standpoint, I think from a speed standpoint,
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:59.400]   I think that has implications and opportunities and things like stadiums like we talked about.
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:06.400]   Because you can only... The problem with millimeter wave is at 24 gigahertz, which bounces off everything.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.400]   Right.
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:08.400]   Including raindrops.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:14.400]   And you have to be something like 900 feet from the transmitter.
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:19.400]   But what I was going to say, though, is that with that being kind of the big difference,
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.400]   and there will be things that can use cases where that will be useful,
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:29.400]   and maybe there will be opportunities to put more transmitters around and make this more applicable in more and more areas.
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:37.400]   I think that a lot of the 600 megahertz 5G, I think a lot of this is not dissimilar to when 4G
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:40.400]   and when LTE started getting rolled out, right?
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:45.400]   There was a big period of time of catch-up between when did we have the infrastructure,
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.400]   when did we have the phones, and when did we see those speeds?
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:54.400]   Because even when I used to call FOGI, which was the fake 4G, 18T and T-Mobile,
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.400]   and Verizon would all say, "Oh, we have 4G," and it was really just 3G, maybe 3.5G.
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:06.400]   But when we actually got LTE and they started to kind of pop up it in pockets
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:13.400]   and then it got more widespread, there was a pretty seismic change in how you could speed it what you could do.
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:18.400]   My fear is it's less like the LTE rollout and more like the YMAX rollout.
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:20.400]   Yes, you're not wrong.
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:22.400]   Remember all the hype about YMAX?
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:24.400]   I think it was that C.
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:25.400]   I've been used it.
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:29.400]   It practically killed Sprint. They decided to go with that.
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:30.400]   It did kill Sprint.
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:33.400]   I mean, it was one of their massive-- it was one of Dan, whatever.
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:36.400]   Hesse is massive failures. That a next sell.
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:39.400]   Those are the two things that killed Sprint were next to LNYMAX.
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:44.400]   And YMAX was not great, but it was what it was.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:50.400]   I think that it's not going to be the same level as what we saw going from 3G to LTE.
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:56.400]   But it's in some ways it's not that different than when we went from 2.5G to 3G.
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:00.400]   You guys are going to benefit, because you're both in highly dense population centers
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:03.400]   where it's much more likely to be available.
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:06.400]   Maybe even-- I think one of the interesting applications Verizon's already doing this
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:08.400]   is as your home internet.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.400]   Yes.
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:12.400]   Because it's fast enough. It's low latency enough to do that.
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:16.400]   And if you're in an area where it's built up, that might be good.
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:17.400]   That might work.
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:22.400]   I don't know. Bandwidth is already-- connectivity is already a pretty serious issue in New York.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:23.400]   Really, how interesting.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:29.400]   So the question is, and then you've got to have rights to put the technology on the different buildings.
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:34.400]   So that's why I think-- I mean, I know that we're going to see the rollout first in stadiums
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:36.400]   because those are controlled environments.
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:39.400]   So AT&T has got a whole plan coming next year.
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:45.400]   And you've also got a critical mass of people and an ability to do something with them,
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:47.400]   again, in a very controlled way.
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:54.400]   So-- but what that means-- we still need the phones.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:57.400]   You still need the applications that can make use of it.
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:58.400]   Right.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:06.400]   Intel made a-- well, Bob Swan, Intel's new CEO, made an amazing admission at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference.
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:08.400]   He followed AMD.
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:10.400]   And he said, "We blew it.
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:14.400]   This is Intel's CEO for the first time saying,
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:20.400]   "We made a mistake trying to maintain 90% CPU market share."
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:22.400]   Which we had.
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:30.400]   But he says, "We're going to change the company to think about 30% of all silicon now."
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:31.400]   Here's the quote.
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:39.400]   "We think that having 30% share in $230 million silicon total available market
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:42.400]   that's going to grow to $300 billion over the next four years,
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:48.400]   we prefer that to-- I'm trying to destroy the thinking about having a 90% share inside our company
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:50.400]   because I think it limits our thinking.
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:53.400]   I think we miss technology transitions.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:58.400]   We miss opportunities because we're so preoccupied with protecting our 90%.
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:16:59.400]   This sounds familiar.
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:03.400]   It sounds like other companies might have gone through this instead of seeing a much bigger market
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:06.400]   with much more innovation going on.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:09.400]   Quite an interesting revelation.
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:17.400]   I don't know what it means for Intel, but it sounds like they'd be happier with a third of a total silicon market
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.400]   than a 90% of the CPU market.
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:21.400]   It is interesting.
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:25.400]   I think it is an admission, as he said, that they took their ball off of--
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:27.400]   They took their eyes off the ball.
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:28.400]   They got no GPUs.
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:32.400]   They got-- their mobile was a failure.
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:34.400]   They can't get to seven nanometers.
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:36.400]   They can't get to 10 nanometers.
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:37.400]   Right.
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:38.400]   Exactly.
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:44.400]   By being so focused on, "Oh, we have to maintain this percentage of CPU, this dominance here."
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:53.400]   They completely missed what the next big evolutions and the next big waves of innovation in computing,
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:58.400]   which is to his point not necessarily controlled by the CPU.
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:00.400]   I've said this before.
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:04.400]   I think this is obviously too late now, but Intel's mobile thing was such a failure.
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:10.400]   I feel like they had an opportunity, seven, eight years ago, they could have become similar to Qualcomm
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:11.400]   or Samsung.
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:13.400]   They could have been their own arm.
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:21.400]   They could have had their own arm process of having their own arm ships that were under
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:22.400]   the Intel name.
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:27.400]   I feel like if they'd done that, they might have actually been able to even maintain something
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:30.400]   in the mobile space.
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:32.400]   But at this point, mobile's gone.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:39.400]   NVIDIA and lots of other companies are really steaming ahead AMD in GPUs that, "Yeah, I think
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:40.400]   this is smart."
[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:46.400]   It's a kind of incredible admission on his part, but also it's, I think, a good thing to see
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:50.400]   that at least there's an admission from the top that they haven't been on it and that they've
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:54.400]   missed things that really could have been key to the future of their business.
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:55.400]   They can't do any worse.
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:57.400]   Let's put it that way.
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:02.400]   Reddit this week did something that neither Twitter nor Facebook has had the gut, the gumption
[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:03.400]   to do.
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:09.040]   They banned 61 accounts and a subreddit after discovering that they were Russian sock puppet
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.040]   accounts.
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:18.400]   These accounts had released leaked US-UK trade documents in an effort to impact the upcoming
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:21.400]   US-UK trade talks.
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:24.600]   When they discovered this, they banned 61 Redditors.
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:32.800]   They killed a subreddit because they were trying to manipulate the US and the UK governments
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:36.800]   through Reddit.
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:38.400]   I think Twitter has had a hard time.
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:45.120]   They say they're doing, but it don't seem to be very successful at it or Facebook either.
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:50.320]   Let's see.
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:52.800]   Elon Musk not guilty.
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:54.120]   That surprised me, I'll be honest.
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:56.480]   Apparently you can call people "pedos" and it's okay.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:20:04.120]   I mean, look, I'm not a huge fan of libel suits and in general, but this one I'm actually
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:08.480]   a little bit surprised because this was not a public figure and it wasn't just what he
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:09.480]   said on Twitter.
[02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:11.240]   It was what he then followed up with.
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:13.440]   He doubled down.
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:14.680]   He doubled and tripled down.
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:19.240]   Going to the press and trying to push that incendiary false idea.
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:22.360]   I mean, hey, that's what the jury found.
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:27.160]   His defense and apparently it swayed the jury was, "Oh, we call people "pedo guys"
[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:29.440]   in South Africa all the time.
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:32.800]   It's just a normal thing to call people.
[02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:40.560]   I think that, I don't know, I wonder if this was going to wind up being a speech issue.
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:41.760]   Maybe that's it.
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:45.040]   The guy's not a public figure.
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:46.960]   He sued the cave diver, sued him.
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:48.440]   I understand why he sued him.
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:53.040]   I might have done the same, especially after he doubled down and said, "Well, no, I got
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:54.040]   the evidence.
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:55.040]   I got the proof."
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:58.080]   He didn't say it's a, "Oh, it's just a nickname."
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:02.080]   Anyway, another bullet dodged by Mr. Musk.
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:05.240]   I think tweeting something.
[02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:07.960]   I think if he had done, we've seen on Reddit.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:12.560]   We've seen plenty of other people go after in a way.
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:13.560]   This was a tweet.
[02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:15.760]   Well, this was what surprised me though.
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:19.920]   It was a tweet, but then it was also him following up with a BuzzFeed, a reporter,
[02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:21.560]   is insane.
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:25.760]   What he tried to retroactively claim was off the record email saying, "Oh, no, I have
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:28.760]   evidence and you should look into this guy and doubling down on that."
[02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:31.080]   If it were just about the tweet, I'm in post-three minutes.
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:32.840]   I realized there was that.
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:33.840]   Yeah.
[02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:37.240]   Maybe that wasn't well explained enough to the jury.
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:38.240]   I don't know.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:42.200]   If it were just the Twitter thing I'm with you, to me what made it more egregious was
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:50.920]   him taking the, going to the press and trying to push this false, completely false narrative
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:54.960]   to reporters as a way of defending himself against what he tweeted.
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:57.800]   That to me was where I was like, "Okay, this is where I'm not."
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:00.240]   Imagine how much more of this.
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:05.200]   Imagine how much more productive we would all be without these ridiculous distractions.
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:13.520]   If we were able to focus and be productive and get our work done without Twitter or pick-
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:15.760]   Yeah, well, we find some distractions.
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:17.400]   Something else would come up in distractors.
[02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:19.320]   If it weren't Twitter, I think it'd be something else.
[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:22.800]   I just think it's interesting you won't let your daughter have any social media.
[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:23.800]   I think that's-
[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:25.160]   Well, we have.
[02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:27.960]   We created a digital trust fund.
[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:30.080]   Regular trust fund, except instead of money.
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:31.960]   It's her username and password to trust.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:32.960]   Oh, that's smart.
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:35.880]   So once you're old enough to handle it, you can have your username on Twitter.
[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:36.880]   Right.
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:40.520]   So she's got her name registered everywhere and we constantly put into that, but she has
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:41.680]   no access.
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:44.840]   You admit, and I don't want to talk about it if you don't want it, but last time you were
[02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:51.880]   on you talked a little bit about the extent, the lengths you go to at home to protect yourself.
[02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:54.520]   Highly sophisticated stuff you're doing.
[02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:56.360]   I thought that was very interesting.
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:58.400]   Are you someday write an article about that?
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:22:59.400]   Maybe after-
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:03.960]   It was one of the shows that I was on recently with you.
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:09.960]   We talked briefly about the network configuration that we have and that we-
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:10.960]   For her.
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:13.160]   I just don't want to give anything away because-
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:16.080]   I mean, it's not all that complicated really.
[02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:21.080]   You could use an off the shelf firewall.
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:22.080]   You could config something-
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:26.360]   But you've gone a little bit beyond it, I think.
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:27.360]   Well, I think-
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:29.360]   That was my sense of it anyway.
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:32.840]   I'm not going to explain what we did.
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:33.840]   No.
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:39.360]   I want to get into the key base group that you're in that discusses all these techniques.
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:41.360]   Obviously, very sophisticated.
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:45.080]   Actually, they're all listeners of this show.
[02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:49.680]   The reason that I have microphone is because one of them was like, "You sound terrible.
[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:51.240]   You need a better microphone."
[02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:52.240]   Oh, nice.
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:54.440]   We would have sent you a good microphone.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:55.440]   I don't know why we didn't.
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:56.440]   I apologize.
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:58.440]   Yeah, it's so anyhow.
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:00.280]   You sound great now.
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:01.280]   Thank you.
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:02.600]   At Leola Port on Keybase.
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:07.560]   Actually, we're trying to set up a triangulation with one of the founders of Keybase because
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:09.160]   I'm a huge Keybase.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:10.160]   Did you get Lumens?
[02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:11.160]   Did you sign up?
[02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:14.960]   I get, every once in a while, the Lumen bot comes by, sprinkles some Lumens on me.
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:18.360]   I don't know what to do with it, but I'm not a cryptocurrency guy.
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:22.360]   I got those seven Bitcoins sitting in the vault that I can't unlock.
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:23.800]   You can't get it right.
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:29.440]   I was in Vienna, and I was in -- I forget what country.
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:30.440]   I was somewhere.
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:31.440]   I was in London, maybe.
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:35.520]   I'm walking up the street, and there's a store called Bitcoin Store.
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:41.120]   It's a store where you can go buy Bitcoin and then buy things in the store using the
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:45.360]   Bitcoin that you just bought, which is -- if that's not Pete Crypto, I don't know what
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:46.360]   it is.
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.360]   Oh, that's total Pete.
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:48.360]   Yeah, that's great.
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:49.360]   Yeah.
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:51.680]   Some of the other cryptocurrencies, at least, are stable.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:55.120]   I wouldn't want to -- Bitcoin goes, "Eh, eh, eh, eh."
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:59.600]   And honestly, we're hearing a lot about some of the reasons for these fluctuations.
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:01.440]   Yeah, that's the interesting thing.
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:04.160]   A lot of manipulation, it feels like, going on, right?
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:05.240]   Oh, of course there is.
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:11.920]   But the trough to me about some of the crypto stuff is just that because so much of that,
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:14.720]   the transaction fees can be so ridiculously high.
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:17.400]   And the speed of the transaction is so low.
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:18.640]   Well, that's it, right?
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:21.240]   You have to pay more money if you want your transaction to go through.
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:26.520]   Yeah, at that point, you're like, "Okay, well, then what's the point of doing this?"
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.280]   Real quickly, Magic Leap, some of the dust is off the pumpkin.
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:31.280]   Mm-hmm.
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:38.000]   Kind of an interesting -- Before we trash and make fun of Magic Leap, may I just say that
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:46.120]   I don't -- just because it's possible for a company to make a market, to invent groundbreaking
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:51.480]   technology, and to not have a business model to support the commercial aspirations of
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:52.480]   that company.
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:58.280]   There is also -- and I will grant you this -- a definite desire in the tech press to find
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:00.960]   the next Elizabeth Holmes.
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:04.560]   Like we're all looking for -- But this is not vaporware.
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.240]   I have been down on their campus.
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:07.240]   You've used it.
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:08.240]   I've used it.
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:12.600]   I've also read a hefty number of their patents back to back.
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:13.600]   Okay.
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:14.600]   Good.
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:15.600]   I'm glad you're on.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:18.200]   But it's a fun company to make fun of.
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:24.480]   I mean, listen, Roni, years ago, when they were supposed to show something at a TED talk,
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:28.120]   wound up on stage wearing a space suit and danced around a weird music for seven minutes.
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:29.920]   They mentioned that, yes.
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:34.360]   There is plenty here that -- and they made ridiculous promises that even went beyond
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:35.360]   muscular prices.
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:36.360]   Well, I think that's the thing.
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:38.120]   And they raised -- Go out of money.
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:39.480]   They raised $10 million.
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:40.480]   Yeah.
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:41.480]   Okay.
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:46.320]   So what I have seen them working on and what they are building is like nothing I've ever
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:47.920]   seen before.
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:50.520]   And this to me falls within the realm of basic research.
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:56.280]   And it is the exact reason why the street punishes -- Punished Amazon and punishes the
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:01.800]   big companies because they don't want -- they don't want work being done that's not revenue
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:02.800]   generating.
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:04.800]   And for the first -- Which is fair.
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:08.520]   Well, listen, Magic Leap is working on the kind of stuff that's not going to generate
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:09.520]   revenue for a while.
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:12.760]   Which is -- which is -- I think the argument you're making is fair.
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:16.560]   But I also think it's fair to come back and say the problem is that they didn't ever
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:18.280]   sell themselves as that, right?
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.640]   Like it wasn't ever expressed as we're doing these things that will be however many years
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:25.280]   in the future and that this is the building block of this, this, and this.
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:28.520]   Well, it's hard to raise capital saying, please invest in us.
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:29.520]   You're not wrong.
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:30.520]   You think 20 years.
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:31.520]   I don't disagree with that.
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:32.520]   That works in biotech.
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:36.320]   It's in bioin pharma that does not work in the tech.
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:37.800]   I understand this.
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:41.280]   But the reality still is, I understand that that's how it works.
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:46.000]   But the reality is, is when you, frankly, mislead people and when what you're saying
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:50.720]   is not actually coming to fruition, then people are going to feel burned and there is going
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:53.160]   to be shot in Florida based on what happens.
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:56.000]   And I'm not saying that there's a way -- I don't know if there's a way that they could
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.080]   have won or they could have done better, right?
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:27:59.640]   Which is disappointing and which is sad.
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:01.440]   So this is the problem.
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:06.600]   It's when there's a rush to commercialize technology before it's ready.
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:12.000]   And so, you know, I wasn't in the meetings when these things were being discussed.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:19.080]   I can just say, what did he, what did Roni, somebody promised like a million, some stupid
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:20.080]   number of people.
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:21.080]   He said there'd be a million.
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:22.080]   That's right.
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:24.680]   A million first and then he went down to a hundred thousand according to the information.
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:27.560]   I mean, these headsets are not ready for prime time.
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:31.280]   No, this is my question because you say, now you've used the beast, right?
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.280]   You used the big thing.
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:33.280]   No, no, I've got --
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:39.720]   So what they sold and what I've used is basically -- and we're talking -- I just assume people
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:41.640]   know it magically because I shouldn't.
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:44.000]   We're talking about an augmented reality headset.
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.120]   I would call it extended reality, but it's a pair of glasses that wraps around your head
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.400]   with a compute that sort of clips to your belt and a wristband.
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:55.160]   And that's what they sold for, I think, 1500 bucks, I can't remember, was expensive, it
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:57.160]   was a developer's edition.
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.480]   That's what this information article is talking about.
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:03.280]   They say they've only sold 6,000 instead of 100,000.
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:05.720]   That's not a big deal.
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:11.520]   Have you tried this little headset and compared it to the real product demo that was getting
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:15.240]   people like you and Steven Levy all excited and a froth?
[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:16.960]   So there's a difference, obviously.
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:19.360]   Here's what I would say.
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:21.520]   This is a -- we need to be patient.
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:26.120]   We're talking about the kind of basic -- that we're talking about fundamental shifts in communications
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:30.760]   technology that are going to be rolling out over the next decade or so.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:33.560]   Every company is working on connected glasses.
[02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:35.520]   Amazon's already got a product.
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:42.280]   2020 is the year of the beginning of glasses.
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:45.360]   The problem is that this is much more complicated technology.
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:49.720]   It's not like iterating on a mobile phone, so it's going to take time.
[02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:55.680]   I stand by what I continue to say, which is what I have seen and what I have read and
[02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:59.440]   what I have experienced from Magic Leap is unlike anything I've ever seen before.
[02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:05.320]   Now, whether or not they can create a commercial product at scale using that technology in
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:10.600]   a time frame that appeases tech bloggers, I don't know.
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:12.080]   That's probably not going to happen.
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:13.080]   But it doesn't mean that we just count.
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:14.680]   And it's not a bad thing.
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:19.200]   Almost every technology has gone through that cycle and it's very frequent.
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.200]   Look at the railroads.
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:24.000]   We've got a transcontinental railroad, but all the companies that built it went bankrupt.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000]   Right.
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.160]   And maybe that's what happens here and that's unfortunate.
[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:30.960]   The only thing I'm not going to give the company a pass on because I will completely agree
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:34.200]   with everything Zaimi is saying that it takes time.
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:35.200]   It is a long slog.
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:36.400]   You have to raise money to do this.
[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.680]   It's not something you can iterate quickly on.
[02:30:38.680 --> 02:30:43.480]   But for better or worse, they did make the decision to make the outrageous claims.
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:44.480]   They did make the decision.
[02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:48.560]   Do you CGI to create the demo video that they said?
[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:49.560]   This is it.
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:50.560]   Yes.
[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:51.560]   And more than that.
[02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:52.560]   Special effects company made it.
[02:30:52.560 --> 02:31:00.960]   More than that, I think honestly, the biggest disconnect they had was that the demos that
[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:03.880]   Stephen Levy and people like Amy have seen in the future and saying that's the most
[02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:08.360]   impressive thing you've ever seen, that is completely different than what shipped.
[02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:12.160]   And there was never a clear explanation from them.
[02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:13.160]   Well, no.
[02:31:13.160 --> 02:31:17.680]   >> The stuff that's impressive to me is the physics.
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:21.760]   So I don't need whales jumping out of wherever.
[02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:27.960]   The fact that I can map the spatial computing environment allows me to map without lag on
[02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:33.560]   a normal crappy network in the middle of New York City to map a space.
[02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:38.840]   And I can release objects that observe physics in that space and are relatable to me.
[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:42.800]   And then I am part of that computing environment is what knocked my socks off.
[02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:43.800]   >> Okay.
[02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:45.600]   >> Which is so I don't know.
[02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:47.080]   >> And the problem is that the average--
[02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:53.360]   By the way, that is a big part of the first the show you consulted on is this whole notion
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:55.720]   of putting on glasses, sharing of--
[02:31:55.720 --> 02:32:01.920]   >> The model is that the thing that replaces the smartphones that we-- this is the model
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:06.400]   that I built a couple years ago talking about the future is that smartphones recede to the
[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:12.480]   background and are replaced by connected glasses and some other thing like a ring or a wristband
[02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:13.480]   for the time being.
[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:14.480]   >> I love that idea.
[02:32:14.480 --> 02:32:16.760]   >> And that's-- we're in the process of that starting to happen.
[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:20.960]   >> How many companies made smartphones that flopped until Apple came out with the iPhone?
[02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:23.040]   I mean, there were a lot of them.
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:27.960]   >> And to be fair, many reality has been around from the 90s.
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:29.760]   It was invented for your housing.
[02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:34.040]   So we just-- we all need to exercise some patience.
[02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:38.200]   >> Was Magic Leap doing something quantitatively different-- qualitatively different from HoloLens?
[02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:39.200]   >> Yes, absolutely.
[02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:42.840]   >> So the thing they put out was very much like HoloLens.
[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:49.280]   HoloLens is a better AR.
[02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:52.400]   So I think of HoloLens more like live mapping.
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:58.560]   So you're in a construction person or an electrician and you're trying to compare blueprints
[02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:01.360]   and do the repairs at the same time and you can see the overlay.
[02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:05.160]   And that was the original promise of AR when it was first conceptualized.
[02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:09.320]   Magic Leap is different in a spatial computing environment.
[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:13.000]   You are part of what the data-- you are also the data that's being computed, right?
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.600]   So to me, these are different things.
[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:19.800]   It's an entirely new ecosystem that's in the process of being born.
[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:26.400]   And I completely agree, making crazy promises, working on commercial-- you know, but here's
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:27.400]   the problem.
[02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:32.560]   The problem is there's a bunch of areas of tech and science that require massive sums
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:35.280]   of money for research.
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:38.680]   And that used to be provided by through grants from the federal government.
[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:42.560]   But the federal government in our current administration has cut back on funding.
[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:47.120]   So we're expecting the commercial sector to fill the gap.
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:54.360]   And that puts a lot of pressure on these companies to rush things to market before they're ready.
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:59.400]   The dumbest announcement I think I've ever seen in my life came from Google last week
[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:05.120]   or the week before when they announced that DeepMind was powering recommendations in the
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:06.120]   Play Store.
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:07.120]   Like, what?
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:11.760]   That's the stupidest use of the hardest people on the planet.
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:12.760]   Right?
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:17.520]   So to me, that's totally illustrative of the problem.
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:19.320]   The pressure to produce the problems.
[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:20.320]   They had to show the value.
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:23.520]   And I get a lot of money to do this.
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:25.400]   Extraordinary sums of money.
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:31.240]   And if the government is not going to fund it, then we can't get pissed off when the private
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:38.960]   sector is spending that money and doesn't razzle-dazzle us every quarter with something cool and shiny
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:39.960]   and new.
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:40.960]   You're not wrong.
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:45.360]   But I would posit with Magic Leap that one of their issues is I think that they were
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:46.760]   secretive for a long time.
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:47.760]   People didn't see things.
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:51.840]   They might have served them better to stay secretive and stay doing things and not to
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:54.040]   apologize at all, to be honest.
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:55.040]   And I told them.
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:56.040]   I told them.
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:57.040]   Yeah.
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:58.040]   I hadn't monetized it.
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:03.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:05.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:08.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:11.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:13.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:16.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:19.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:21.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:22.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:23.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:24.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:25.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:26.040]   I had a lot of money to do this.
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:32.560]   I have to say there was a Theranos-like reaction to this story by Alex Harvey in -- or Alex
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:39.720]   Heath, I'm sorry, in the information, according to Alex, after the story was published, the
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:45.520]   information learned of an internal magically ball hands meeting earlier this week in which
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:49.880]   magically it's chief marketing officer described the story that they were working on as click
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:51.760]   bait and a bunch of BS.
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:55.280]   He called this reporter an a-hole and said others in the media were looking to expose
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:57.880]   the next Theranos or we work.
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:00.280]   I don't think anybody is interested magically.
[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:02.280]   It's not that level of shit.
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:04.280]   No, unlike Theranos and we work and we --
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:06.280]   It's not a good click bait.
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:09.880]   Unlike Theranos, this is a product that does actually exist and this is technology that
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:10.880]   actually --
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:11.880]   And it was a good click bait.
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:16.280]   Unlike Theranos, this was not providing people incorrect medical information.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:18.280]   It's not that very many, but it's not.
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:19.280]   Yes, I do.
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:24.120]   But this is where the shortcuts -- there's a reason that we like to use stories and to
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:30.520]   use analogies and that's because shortcuts help our brains save cognitive power.
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:33.360]   There's a problem in simplifying.
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:34.360]   There is.
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:36.800]   But I think that the broader thing too is people have to look at why is there the shot
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:39.880]   and pointer around this and it's because it had been so hyped and a lot of that is the
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:42.160]   fault of the tech precedent of itself, right?
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:43.160]   It feeds on itself, right?
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:48.280]   But it's like the very same people and I count myself kind of part of this, you know, who
[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:52.000]   feed these hype cycles are also the first to want to tear it down.
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:58.360]   I would say, and Jesse Hempel before she moved from Wired to LinkedIn, I think did a very
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:00.600]   fair job of covering Magic Leap.
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:03.400]   It was not glowing, but it was also not sarcastic.
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:05.280]   But I'm not talking about her.
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:10.560]   I'm talking about the broader kind of like, you know, the CNNs, the big kind of headline
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:13.840]   things about what this is going to be, you know, becomes this narrative.
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:19.440]   And then we are -- the tech press does enjoy being able to tear it down when it doesn't
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:20.680]   live up to expectations.
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:23.880]   There's a certain, you know, oh, this high-fluting thing, you know, everybody thought it was
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.720]   going to be so great and now it's not.
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.760]   There is a certain joy that people get out about whether that's fair or not.
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:33.360]   My only comment and you and I are in agreement on it was that they shouldn't have privatized
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:34.360]   this.
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:37.840]   They should have kept this as an incubated research thing because the problem is now that it is
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:42.320]   a product thing and it's not and they have actual numbers to look at, that unfortunately
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:46.800]   will impact how much more funding they can get, which is really detrimental probably to
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:49.640]   the progress for this field in general, right?
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:51.640]   They're going to need it because the information is right.
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:54.640]   They're burning 40 to 50 million dollars a month.
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:57.600]   So they may be back looking for more money.
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:01.240]   So I'm sure that's why they're very defensive about that article.
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:06.160]   Folks, I have a pledge to keep the show shorter than the Irishman.
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:10.880]   And if we don't wrap it up now, I'm going to fail my pledge.
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:14.080]   So I have to say, goodbye, even though there was so much more we could talk about when
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:16.240]   I get a panel like this, I just don't want to stop.
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:18.440]   And I thank you so much for being here.
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:21.000]   Welcome, girl, Christina Warren.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:22.000]   Give us a plug.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:23.720]   You're still, of course, doing Rocket.
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:24.720]   I'm sure, right?
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:25.720]   Yes.
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:26.720]   On the --
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:30.960]   Absolutely in Rocket at a really dot at them slash rocket with Brianna Wu and Simone
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:31.960]   DeRoucheur.
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:32.960]   Great show.
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.280]   Yeah, we post episodes every Thursday and you can find me online at @film_girl and
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:38.280]   you can see videos.
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:41.200]   I do at work at youtube.com/microsoft-developer.
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:42.200]   Nice.
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:44.360]   Are you hitting the road again?
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:46.360]   Are you going to put your back out?
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:47.360]   Yeah.
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:50.080]   I have a few -- I have like a month or so off.
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:53.520]   I'm going to be going home actually for a few weeks for the holidays.
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:58.440]   And then I will be in Johannesburg at the end of January and then I'll be in Sydney and
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:38:59.960]   then in Singapore and February.
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.200]   So there's my next big three.
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:02.200]   Sounds great.
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:03.200]   International stuff.
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:04.200]   Home at Lana or home Brooklyn.
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:05.200]   Home at Lana.
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:06.200]   And Lana.
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:07.200]   We'll have a great trip.
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:09.000]   And it's great to see you once again.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:10.000]   Great thing.
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:11.000]   Thanks for having me.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:17.800]   By the way, thank you so much, Amy Webb, because without your vision of the future, I just
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:20.440]   be stuck in the present and I don't like it here.
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:22.480]   I don't like it one bit.
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.320]   Amy Webb writes about the future at amiweb.io.
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:28.080]   You can get her books there.
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:30.640]   And anything else you'd like to talk about or plug?
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:32.280]   When's your podcast coming out?
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:33.480]   Oh, my God.
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:34.560]   You're the podcast, man.
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:35.560]   Not me.
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:36.760]   Well, let's do a podcast together.
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:39.760]   I would love to get you on the --
[02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:40.760]   I would love to.
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:41.760]   Yeah.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:48.320]   I would just say, if anybody's interested in futurism and foresight and tech and trends,
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:51.680]   all of our research is open source and free.
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:55.000]   And that's available at futuretodayinstitute.com.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.480]   Everything that we do is for the public.
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:58.480]   Nice.
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:39:59.640]   Amy, always a pleasure.
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:00.640]   Thank you for being here.
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:04.840]   I know you had a cold and I'm sorry you had to suffer, but I appreciate your spending
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:05.840]   some time with us.
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:06.840]   Thanks a lot.
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:09.280]   Thanks also to our live studio audience.
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:14.900]   It was great to have you visiting us from Nashville, Tennessee and Vancouver, British
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:16.240]   Columbia.
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:19.560]   If you'd like to be in the studio, we do the show on Sunday afternoons, but we do shows
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:20.560]   all week long.
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:22.040]   Just email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:25.760]   Let us know when you'll be in Petaluma and we'd love to have you come by.
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:30.840]   What will be dubbed the last pass -- twit last pass studio pretty soon.
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:32.920]   Thank you, last pass.
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:34.040]   Tickets at twit.tv.
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:39.120]   We do the show this week in tech every Sunday afternoon, 230 Pacific.
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:42.200]   It's 530 Eastern, 2230 UTC.
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:45.720]   Our live streams, audio and video are available at twit.tv/live.
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:48.520]   If you're watching live, I invite you to join us in the chatroom.
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:49.920]   A great bunch of people.
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:51.480]   Always a good conversation.
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:54.320]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:56.360]   Thank you both Christina and Amy.
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:59.600]   They were both in the chatroom, which is a very brave thing to do while you're trying
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:01.680]   to do a show at the same time.
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:03.400]   I appreciate it.
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:09.400]   Thanks also to all of you who will be watching a future version of this show by downloading
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:12.840]   it from our website, twit.tv.
[02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:17.080]   Better yet, subscribe in your favorite podcast application that way.
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:21.600]   They'll feature us if enough of you subscribe and you won't ever have to worry about.
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:25.400]   When is Twitter out, it'll just automatically appear on your device.
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:27.920]   You can also listen on your voice-enabled device.
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:37.040]   In most cases you just say, "Hey, you know who, play Twit Live or maybe play This Week
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:41.640]   in Tech," and it'll give you the latest on your voice device.
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:42.640]   Thanks for being here.
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:43.640]   We'll see you next time.
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:44.640]   Another Twit.
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:45.640]   This is amazing.
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:46.640]   I'm like...
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:47.640]   Do the Twit.
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:48.640]   Do the Twit.
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:49.640]   All right.
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:50.640]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:51.640]   Do the Twit.
