[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's kind of funny because the president walks out and says, "Some have called the PSP an iPod killer."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I'm thinking about it, and being here at Macworld just kind of reaffirmed that.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I don't think the PSP is going to garner the audience that the iPod has or will have.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   How could it even be considered that?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   There's no hard drive in the thing.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   There's no hard drive.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It plays these weird proprietary DVD discs.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Yeah, use a UMD, but the benefit is that--
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Doesn't UMD sound like a birth control device, or am I wrong?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   No.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You're still having sex, aren't you, Kevin?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Don't put that mic in my face.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Did you see the keynote, Leo?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   At CES or--
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   No, at Macworld.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Jobs, yeah.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Did you see how Jobs hinted at the fact that Sony might acquire Apple?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I think this was the most significant thing that happened at the keynote, and I think was overlooked.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So, President Sony comes out, talks, loses his place, gets lost, Jobs comes back to save him,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and then at the end he says, "You know, we really should do a computer together."
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And smirks.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Computer or music or something like that.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Yeah, and you would never see Jobs do anything offhand like that.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   No, no.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   That was planned.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   We were sitting--I was walking around the show for a while with a couple of guys who were sitting behind the president,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   one of the presidents--there's like 30 presidents at Sony--
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   but he said as soon as they unveiled the Mac Mini, the guy wigged out in his seat.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   "Oh my God, we're dead! We're dead!"
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Well, I think that there was a rumor a couple of years ago that Sony was going to acquire Apple.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Obviously, they're competitors in a lot of areas, but I think that maybe--I mean, Jobs didn't drop that hint for nothing.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Right, I agree.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   There's something going on there.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   They're definitely in talks.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   They're talking about something.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Now, remember, Sony did the first PowerBook.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   The PC.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Say again?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   They're moving OS X to the PC.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Ooh, could Avaya with OS X be in the works?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I would love OS X to the PC.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Let's start that rumor right now.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I would buy that in a heartbeat.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I don't think that'll ever happen, do you?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Nah, probably not.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Hey, we want to make a big announcement here, though, don't we?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I think we have a big announcement to make.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Go ahead.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   They're all looking at me.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   David Prager is pregnant.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   No, no, no, that's not it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Oh yeah, we were thinking that maybe we should--
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Are you announcing a web ring?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Is that what you're announcing?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I would think, yeah, well, this is a web ring.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's kind of trivializing, but I think we should do some sort of alliance of former tech TV people.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   So it's not really a syndication of content.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It's an aggregation of content from very select few sources that we have a lot of trust in and belief in, and we know that--
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   How would you like to be the VP of marketing?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   He just got the job.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   David sounds like he's a marketing guy, doesn't he?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   He just sells the keywords, right, doesn't he?
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I think he just spun the announcement.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   That's funny.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   He's the spin doctor.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   We're thinking that somehow--we all have the things we do.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Yeah, we're all going off on our different paths.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   We're doing different things.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Tell us what you're doing.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   This is Kevin Rose, by the way.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Well, tell us what we're doing.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Tell us what you're doing.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Tell us what you're doing.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I don't want to get in trouble.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   When are you going to put this up for download?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Nobody G4 listens to podcasts, so you're all right.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Okay, awesome.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Now, I actually, obviously, you know I've done the broken stuff in the past.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Don't violate your contract, though.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Be cool.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I'm not violating it.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   But what I really want to do is that, you know, there's certain content that we just can't air on G4 anymore
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   because it's just a little too hardcore.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Nobody wants to see Unix command prompts on television, at least on this network,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   because people turn the channel, the majority of people.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   But there's a lot--
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   They're much more Canadian.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Canadians love it.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   They love that stuff.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   They want more.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Well, it's winter in Canada.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   There's not much to do.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   We're geeks, though, Leo.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   We love that kind of stuff.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   We want Unix command prompts.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And we want Unix command prompts.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So there's nothing wrong--
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   In fact, in my contract is the ability to do my own personal web project.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So you can do that.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I can do that.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And I want to do more of that.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So I'm getting the equipment together.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And with friends, old Tech TV cast members, I'm going to put together some downloadable videos and how-tos.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   You know, one of the most things that I know that you enjoy and that I enjoy most about what we used to do on the old screensavers
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   is that we were actually teaching people something about technology.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Right.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And it was so nice to get the e-mails and the callers that would say, "Hey, I learned so much from you guys."
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Well, that happened on the show floor.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   You know, Patrick and I were wandering around Macworld today.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   In fact, nobody recognized me until I was walking around with Patrick.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Nobody recognized me until I was wandering around with you.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But as soon as we were together--
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And what is the universal thing?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   We want to see more of what you guys did.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   What happened?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   We want Tech TV back.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Where's Pat's hair?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   No, no.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Not one person said that.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It's funny because I was walking around the floor with a camera over my shoulder and a large bag on my back and a cat,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and people still, like, went up to me and shook my hand.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   They said, "Roger Chang, we know you."
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So, but Kevin's making a good point, which is that people want that kind of content.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And there's nowhere on TV right now you can get it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So, we're all doing our own thing.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I'm going to be putting some little videos together and putting those out.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Leo, I know you've got some stuff in the works, and Patrick, we're convincing him to create his own website.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   This is the announcement.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   He needs the announcement right now.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is the big announcement.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Patrick Norton.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   All right, here's the deal.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Leo and Kevin are so disgusted with the fact that I am still not, quote, "on the web" or the interweb, as I like to call it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   In any form or fashion.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   In any form or fashion.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Except for the articles you write.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Yeah, except for the articles I write for other people.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That if I do not have a website for us to put together by March 17th, that would be St. Patrick's Day.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   See, that's easy to remember.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   They're going to put one together for me.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   We figure we'll find some way to make it easy for you to put content up.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And the truth is they're probably going to figure out a way to replace blogging, because it's got to be more bomb-proof and idiot-proof than blogging for me to do it on a regular basis.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I'm thinking we give them a little recorder that just kind of broadcasts to the net.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   We give them a recorder.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I'll transcribe it, and I'll put it in blog post form for him.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It'll be like Andy Rooney's Spot of 60 Minutes.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   What is the story with this?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Blogging!
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I think Dvorak already has that job.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   But we're going to get you on the net.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I'll be like the foul Andy Rooney.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The naughty Andy Rooney.
