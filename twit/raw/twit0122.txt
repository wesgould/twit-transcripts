[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.480]   >> Oh, you never know.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.240]   When it might come-- I've only married one,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.520]   and that was on the screensavers, that's why I did it, right?
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.600]   >> Yeah, I've only married one myself.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.640]   >> But John, how many of you married?
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.800]   >> That's it one.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.960]   But I intend to-- I intend to up the ante.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.640]   >> Only twit.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.840]   >> Veronica Thaumont has said if she ever got married
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.000]   that I could perform it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.840]   But you know, I've had people say that to me before,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.040]   and then when it comes down to it,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.280]   mom objects or something that happens.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.160]   >> I don't blame them.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.600]   >> You're not going to have that Dweeb, Mary.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.320]   What are you talking about?
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.520]   You're going to have a real minister with a real collar.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.040]   A guy who actually believes-- a believer.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.360]   >> That's a collar.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.680]   >> Yeah, you can have a collar.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.080]   >> So the Kindle is out tomorrow.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.200]   Has anybody seen the Kindle yet?
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.640]   >> I've not got my hands on one.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.080]   Have you, John?
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.920]   >> No, I think it's going to be a disaster.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.600]   >> It looks really stupid.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.120]   >> No backlight.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.080]   >> Well, the Sony doesn't have a backlight either.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.240]   I mean, I think a lot of these e-ink guys
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.560]   don't have a backlight because you want to have
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.640]   a lot of battery life, right?
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.840]   That I can live with.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.920]   >> Yeah, sure.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.880]   But doesn't it have like an extended exterior light or something?
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.360]   >> Yeah, you have a built-in light.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.200]   [SOUND]
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.280]   It's kind of a little reading light on an arm.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   But the Sony, when you buy the Sony,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.600]   it's kind of the same thing.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.680]   It's a separate-- you know, you have to pay for it.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   >> That's right.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.120]   >> And it's just one of those LED lights that you'd buy
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.920]   like a book light.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.600]   >> Sony's is, I'm surprised Sony's isn't a proprietary bulb.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.680]   [LAUGH]
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.240]   >> I think it's a special battery, a Sony battery.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.840]   So the Kindle has, it looks like a keyboard.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.120]   Now I've only seen pictures on Engadget in places.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.360]   It looks like it has a keyboard.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.560]   >> I don't know.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.920]   >> What? You don't know?
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.520]   You haven't seen the pictures?
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.120]   >> No.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.040]   >> Bezos, I mean, look, if anybody could make money in e-books.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.160]   >> I know what you're talking about,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.200]   the little keypad down there.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.480]   >> Yeah, well, you don't know what has all those
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.160]   buttons. All you really need is a next page, previous page.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.200]   >> So you can write the great, very good novel.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.520]   >> Oh, yeah, it's a book and a word processor.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.920]   The thing that they have, they advantage they have,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.680]   apparently has wireless networking in it,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.520]   which means that you can download and buy books from the Kindle.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.680]   >> Right, and don't they have some deal with a particular
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.960]   provider or something?
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   I thought I read.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.440]   >> They're going to do Kindle editions of many newspapers.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.200]   They have a New York Times edition,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.040]   that I think they want to do a Wall Street Journal in Washington
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.760]   Post. I don't know if they've made the deals yet.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.600]   That would make it useful if you could download it,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.280]   like it automatically got your newspapers for you in the morning.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.560]   >> Yeah, the W hotels are apparently going to be doing a deal
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.400]   where you could get your newspaper on a rented Kindle
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.120]   while you're staying at the hotel.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.280]   >> Can anybody, here's the problem I'm having.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.960]   It's too expensive.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.520]   >> 400 bucks.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.680]   >> They're all too expensive.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.080]   >> So they might be in the back book.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.280]   >> Yeah, but you can't put 100 paper back books.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.240]   >> I mean, that's the-
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.480]   >> I'm not going to read 100 paper back books at once.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.640]   >> Yeah, I might listen to a thousand songs over the course of
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.440]   a couple months, but I'm not going to read a thousand books.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.520]   >> It'll have built-in Sprint EVDO, so it has-
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> I know Leo reads faster than I do.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.560]   >> Well, yeah, but you know, okay,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.920]   I was kind of a big fan.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   I had the Sony book reader.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.680]   I thought, oh, this is great.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.040]   And I did. I put a ton of books on there.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.640]   I put all these trilogies.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.480]   >> Do you read them?
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.800]   >> Well, wait a minute. I haven't finished the story.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.960]   I put Neil Stevenson's Quick Silver Trilogy,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.000]   which I have never managed yet to read.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.040]   >> Extremely long.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.320]   >> I keep trying to read it.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.760]   Guy wrote it in Ballpoint or a fountain pen, I think.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.640]   The quill, maybe used a quill.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.600]   I don't know. Anyway, you can go to the Science Fiction Museum
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.440]   and you can see the manuscript pages.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.360]   >> He was on the cranky geeks.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.840]   >> He is a cranky geek.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   >> No, he's not, actually.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.920]   >> He's not? Why is he writing long hand?
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.440]   >> I love that book, though.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.640]   >> He's one of those guys who thinks it's cool.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.160]   >> That's a lot of hundreds of thousands of words
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.080]   to prove you're cool.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.120]   Doesn't- I mean, imagine the writer's cramp.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.080]   >> So you like that book?
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.880]   Because I tried to read it-
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.920]   >> I liked the whole series.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.600]   Yeah, I loved it.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.400]   >> You two damn nerd.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.760]   >> I got a lot of it in it.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.560]   Read the whole thing.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.880]   >> It's bizarre.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's the kind of-
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.800]   The geeks of the Newtonian era.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.200]   >> Yeah. It's just way cool to be because of that,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.520]   because it's taking that geeky, cryptonomic sense
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.640]   and kind of transplanting it to the 1600s
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.480]   and doing a fair job.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.400]   I'm sure it's a little bit modernized,
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   but he does a fair job of trying to stay true
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.920]   to what was going on in those times
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.360]   and trying to unveil some of the things
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.080]   that you wouldn't realize were going on at those times,
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   especially when you've got the guy going about France,
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.760]   trying to get away from the mobs of people
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   who just live out in the sticks
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.520]   because there's no social program.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.920]   And so instead of a homeless situation,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.240]   they get just sent out in the country
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.760]   and they live out in the trees.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.920]   >> I have to try again,
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.000]   but the point was I put all these trilogies on there
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.360]   and I'm thinking now I have 100 books on this thing
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.160]   and I left it on the airplane.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.560]   >> Which if you have a paperback book,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.080]   I've done that before with a paperback book,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.600]   no deal, but I left it on the airplane.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.240]   >> Yeah, I haven't actually heard that story before Leo
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.800]   and I think it's actually telling
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.320]   because that is the point.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.800]   You leave stuff on these airplanes
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.000]   and if everything's 400 bucks, come on.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.440]   >> Yep. And I've left so many books there
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.280]   and I didn't care 'cause I just buy another copy
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.040]   or maybe I didn't like the book that much to begin with.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   >> So-- >> I'm not sure yet
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.800]   if we need a separate device for this.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.160]   I mean, while everything else is sort of merging into one
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.800]   I think we wanna be able to read books
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   on whatever device we've got, not buy a separate one.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.200]   >> No, I agree with that, Tom.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   And I think there should be some universal kind of software
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.560]   that lets you, you know, just item and wanna say it's PDFs
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.920]   but it should be something like that.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.240]   So you can just read it,
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.720]   all these devices should be neutral.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.120]   They should be software and neutral.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.840]   And the fact of the matter is the book,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.200]   the way the book is actually made a real book,
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.520]   like a real paper bad book,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   this is not a device that's broken
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.680]   that needs to be fixed by this solution.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.160]   >> True, it's a solution looking for a problem.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.480]   Well, we'll see.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.160]   I mean, I think the idea of having wireless
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.280]   so that you can get your newspaper and it's there.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.000]   I have to say, I mean, looking at the pictures
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.080]   then who knows what it'll really look like
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.880]   but looking at the early release pictures.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.440]   So you could do that with a piece of paper.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.560]   You can't do that with a Kindle.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.520]   >> That was like you crumpling up an ebook?
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.040]   >> You can't do that with a Kindle.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.840]   But it looks like the same kind of greenish,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.920]   low contrast screen that Sony has.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.200]   I want paper white.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.840]   Now the iPhone you can read books on
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.040]   and that's actually pretty readable.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.920]   It's pretty legible.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.760]   But you don't have to--
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.600]   >> Yeah, I don't have to read on an iPhone.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.320]   >> Yeah, you don't have the same kind of battery life.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.160]   >> I read a book.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.000]   I read the great Gatsby on a PDA on a tungsten E.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.840]   And it was fine.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.680]   You know what I liked about it
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.480]   is I didn't get a hand cramp from holding the book open
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.080]   like a paper bag and just press a little button to scroll.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.480]   >> The rich are not like you and me.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.880]   They use electronic readers to read their books.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.960]   >> Hey, Tom, get one of those balls and start squeezing it.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.760]   Maybe they'll keep that hand cramp.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.400]   >> What are you doing with your muscle structure
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.960]   that you're getting a hand cramp?
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.040]   >> It's heavy.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.560]   The book is heavy.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.680]   >> Please.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   >> Paper bag books.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.120]   >> It's not used to holding books open.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.280]   It's used to do in other things.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.880]   >> It doesn't do it with hard bags.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.800]   But when paper bags, they got the binding.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.080]   So it's like constantly fighting your hands trying to close.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.480]   I guess you just crack the spine.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.440]   I'm too nice to the book.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.240]   You're just digging a hole deeper and deeper.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.200]   >> Well, we'll watch Monday.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.240]   The Kindle comes out.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   And I'll probably buy one and play with it
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.680]   just because I that kind of guy.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.000]   I don't understand why a book reader needs a QWERTY keyboard,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.640]   but we'll find out.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.640]   I liked your article.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.960]   We haven't been on since you wrote it.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.760]   The Halloween column from John C. Dvorak in PC Magazine.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.520]   The Vista Death Watch.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:50.880]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.960]   That was a huge success that column.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.760]   >> What is it?
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.840]   It's funny because you talk to people like Paul Therat.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.800]   >> Ed Bot, and you and I think a lot of Ed, I think.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.480]   He's a great guy.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.960]   And he says, why are people ragging on Vista?
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.560]   It's fine.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.040]   It's good.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.480]   It's great.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.040]   I love it.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.880]   What's the problem?
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.360]   >> Well, I wrote that column and I got a lot of email.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.920]   And there's always the one guy-- one guy
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   wrote in condemning me.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.720]   But the whole thing was just kind of an illiterate rant
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.520]   and an all upper caps.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.040]   >> Must upper case.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.560]   >> At least when the Apple fanboys rant,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.760]   they know how to use punctuation.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.520]   And anyway, but everybody else was in total agreement with me.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.520]   And they had nothing but trouble.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.160]   And you keep hearing these stories about people
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.720]   that have to revert.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.520]   >> I mean, they've taken some--
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.200]   >> I'm not taking too many of these stories.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.960]   No one ever had to revert from XP to Windows 2000.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.760]   >> I don't think you could.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.680]   >> No, but even with me, nobody was reverting.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.920]   >> Well, I know people who reverted from me to '98
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.000]   if they had upgraded.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.080]   I mean, obviously, if you bought a machine with me on it,
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.000]   you weren't looking to--
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.960]   >> Yeah, but same.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.840]   >> Go back to the company.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.880]   >> Yeah, it's even--
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.720]   >> Tell me '98.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.240]   >> Saying VIST is a little better than ME isn't--
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.640]   isn't saying much.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.200]   I mean, is this the Windows ME Microsoft?
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.040]   >> I think it is.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.880]   I think it really is because it really doesn't give you
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.760]   all that much more than XP.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.600]   And it's got problems.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.320]   I actually set on Buzz Out Loud on Friday
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.880]   that I'm using VISTA for the first time
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.800]   regularly in my house.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.520]   We just got a media center PC hooked up to the computer.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.760]   And it's OK.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.720]   It works.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.080]   I can do things on it.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.760]   But it's annoyingly got bugs.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.800]   The HDMI won't send out audio with the audio card that came
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.440]   with a brand new machine installed with VISTA.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.920]   >> That's probably the DRM.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.520]   >> There's all kinds of support issues about, oh,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.440]   it's the driver needs to be updated.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.120]   And you try this hack and this bat hack
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.360]   and all of that sort of thing.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.480]   And it's the kind of thing you hear about with VISTA.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.200]   Even brand new equipment sometimes doesn't work with it.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.760]   Overall, it works fine.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.200]   It's not great shakes over XP, though.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.480]   I'm not sitting there thinking, wow, this is so much better.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.600]   I've got to upgrade my laptop.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.040]   >> But are you going to see that anymore?
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.000]   I mean, operating systems are pretty mature.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.400]   I don't think we're going to see a revolutionary new operating
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.560]   system.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.480]   >> I felt that way with XP a little bit, though,
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.840]   when I was still stuck on 98.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.640]   And--
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.640]   >> XP was because XP was reliable.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.920]   It had a actual memory management system.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.320]   But you've made that change now.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.000]   I don't know what else?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.080]   I mean, John, you've been through this for a while.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.200]   I'm sure people have always said, oh,
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.440]   but you can't do anything better.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.280]   This is perfect.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.440]   But what would be the next step in an operating system
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.160]   that would make people go, wow, I've got to have that?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.600]   >> Well, I think the main thing, which
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.120]   is what Microsoft promised for this VISTA.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.480]   And they'd never delivered it, which
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.800]   is an indexed database style of file management structure
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.640]   that allows you to find anything instantly.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.360]   >> Yeah, they killed that after about two years.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.040]   >> Well, they killed it because they couldn't do it.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.960]   But why couldn't they do it?
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.120]   I mean, the pick operating system from 25, 35 years ago
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.840]   could do it.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.240]   Yeah, other people have been able to do it.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.280]   How come Microsoft can't do it?
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.960]   They got 20,000 people working there
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.560]   working on code that nobody can do it.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.360]   Give me a break.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.400]   >> Right.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.600]   You offer three choices.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.960]   Give up on the stupid variations, which I agree with you.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.560]   It's crazy.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.680]   They have seven different versions of VISTA.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.480]   People buy Windows Home VISTA Home Basic and find out
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.720]   you can't even address more than a gigabyte of RAM.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.120]   Just art officially.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.400]   It can't do so many things.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   So they end up having to upgrade.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.760]   One good VISTA, VISTA Ultimate, $99 bucks, says Devorak.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.800]   Kind of like what Apple does.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.720]   Little more, Apple does $129 bucks.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.440]   But there's more--
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.120]   >> You need like two versions of it out.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.000]   You need a server version and you need a desktop version.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.920]   >> That's it, right?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.640]   Anything else looks--
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.560]   >> Do you need any other versions?
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.920]   >> It looks like you're squeezing people.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.240]   >> No, here's the other thing.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.720]   What is the point of all these versions?
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.840]   Why don't they just give everybody the best version?
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.720]   Does it cost more to make the disk?
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   I don't think so.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.320]   >> Good point.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.440]   Point two, you say Microsoft should scuttle the entire product.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:42.920]   Why not?
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   Work on a whole new OS starting today with one team.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.160]   Work on service pack three for XP with another team.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.080]   And that keeps people using Windows
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   and offers you a way out.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.800]   Or finally, roll out VISTA 2.0, figure out some way
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.000]   to add some nifty features.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.240]   Maybe stolen from the next version of Mac OS.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.040]   Bring in some outside designers if you have to
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.800]   and lower the price on that one too.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.640]   I think it's good advice.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.960]   >> I guess two, right?
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.520]   >> It's good advice that no one's going to take
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.200]   because it's the advice aimed at Microsoft.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.160]   >> They're not listening to John C. Devorak.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.000]   >> Of course not.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.840]   Why would they?
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.680]   >> And why not?
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.480]   >> Yet I have to point out that the Zoom too
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.240]   is a big improvement over the Zoom one.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.640]   >> Although aren't some people having problems
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.720]   with the firmware?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.840]   >> Already?
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.360]   >> Well, I read some reports of people having issues.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.920]   >> Mine's been working okay.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.320]   The squirkel is kind of weird.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.880]   You look at it, it looks like it's unbalanced.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.880]   It's not symmetric.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.080]   There's something odd about that button.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.880]   But it works and I like it because it supports podcast.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.840]   >> It's a non-equilateral squirkel?
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.680]   >> Yes.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.280]   (laughing)
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.800]   >> It's a parallel squirkel.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.680]   >> A parallel squirkel.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.640]   >> I think that's the problem.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.800]   There's something weird going on with it.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.200]   But it does have a touch thing.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.600]   You know, you can scroll through thing.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.320]   I mean, they've very cleverly got around Apple's patents
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.440]   on the scroll wheel and it kind of,
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.960]   you know, you zip up and down.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.800]   I don't know.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.320]   >> Yeah, I mean, well, Apple's going on to something new.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.160]   >> That's the problem.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   It is the nano, last nano, not the current nano.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   Looks exactly like last year's nano.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.400]   >> I think the Zoom is trying to follow
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.240]   the Internet Explorer pathway
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.680]   where the first couple of versions just aren't anything new.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.840]   They aren't even that great,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.000]   but they slowly get better
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.040]   and then they eventually hope to dominate.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.240]   >> That's how Microsoft works.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.000]   >> They've met, well, I can barely talk.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.840]   (laughing)
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.720]   That's how Microsoft works,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.640]   but how often have they been successful with this strategy?
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   They've only been super successful with the strategy
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.560]   when they've had a monopolistic position.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.560]   The only reason that they have a--
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.920]   >> I don't know, I expect 360.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.440]   >> It's pretty loud.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.080]   >> I think the Xbox is following that a little bit.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   And Internet Explorer did that.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:50.920]   >> Very little bit.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.760]   >> And there's all you were.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.880]   >> It was tied to the operating system, no, you're right.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.760]   >> And there's no only one real competitor with Xbox.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   I mean, they came into the market late.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.600]   And I agree with you,
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.400]   but they didn't use that strategy you described.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.240]   This is just basically just hard.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.520]   This is essentially just hard ball strategy with the Xbox.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.600]   They just bring the thing out
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.960]   and just do what the other guys are doing
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.600]   and just doing kind of--
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.880]   >> Interestingly, the Wii beat 'em in October
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.800]   outsold the Xbox 360.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.200]   >> Well, the Wii--
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.600]   >> The Xbox 360 outsold the PS3 in Japan
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.000]   for the first time last week.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.840]   >> That's sad.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.000]   >> But the Wii still outsold both of them.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.000]   PS3's gonna come back.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.200]   They've got, you know, the last week of October,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.640]   they cut the price.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.760]   They now have a $400 40 gigabyte PS3.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.800]   And that's gonna, I think they're already selling
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.280]   very well in the month of November.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.480]   In fact--
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.360]   >> Yeah, the numbers I saw is that they're selling better,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.800]   but they're still in third place.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.720]   >> Really?
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   >> Okay.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.160]   That's gotta be frustrating.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.000]   Here it is.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.840]   >> Well, you know, I--
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.840]   >> I don't like to bundle as it were the Xbox 360
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.880]   with the rest of Microsoft.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.120]   Everything is kind of a separate operation
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.080]   in a lot of different ways.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.640]   And I admire what the Xbox people are doing.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.680]   >> I like the Xbox 360.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.560]   >> I think Sony has really booted it with the PS3.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.280]   And in some ways it's almost like,
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.600]   not quite as bad as Vista,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.040]   but they ought to think about moving on
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.560]   to the next one already.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.040]   Like Windows Vista.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.000]   >> Yeah, I mean, PS4.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.840]   >> It just shows you,
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.560]   I mean, you could put a lot of money in marketing
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.800]   at billions of dollars into R&D,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.640]   but there's no guarantee that what you're gonna make
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   is gonna be successful.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.760]   It's a tough marketplace.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.280]   >> I think I read something last week
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.040]   that the PS2 is still outselling the PS3.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.960]   >> Yeah, I'm sure it is.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.800]   >> It is.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.960]   >> But there's no games.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.800]   There's no good games.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.640]   >> I said, it's not launched.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.480]   >> If you don't have to make games.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.640]   >> That's the biggest problem with it.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.200]   The price was the other problem,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.520]   but that, like you say, has been somewhat emeliorated.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.680]   But yeah, there's just no games.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.240]   And now Xbox has been kicking out games now.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.280]   They've got Halo, they have Portal,
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.080]   they have plenty of other games that have--
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.400]   >> The Naviero 3 is a huge success.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.520]   >> Back catalog now with Xbox games
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.280]   gonna be able to be downloaded on the Xbox 360.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.160]   I'm not saying the PS3 is dead, really,
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.040]   but they really have messed it up.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.720]   >> Actually, October was a huge month in gaming.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.000]   I think overall hardware and software sales in October,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.400]   they're like $1.1 billion.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.640]   >> I added to that.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.520]   >> Did you? >> Me too.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.160]   >> Yeah, finally got a Wii.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.960]   >> Oh, yeah, interesting.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.080]   And what did you get with your Wii?
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.600]   Did you-- see, this is the problem with the Wii.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   I think the real problem with the Wii
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.960]   is people aren't buying games.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.160]   They're playing the Wii games.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.280]   >> I got a bundle.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.120]   It was the only way to get it.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   It was a Wii Blaster, Legend of Zelda,
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.280]   fantastic for some dragon thing and chicken shoot.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.680]   >> [laughs]
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.120]   >> Sepathetic.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.880]   >> It's a gaming machine for grownups.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.240]   Chicken shoot?
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.800]   Oh, yeah, chicken shoot's good fun.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.880]   [laughs]
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.120]   >> Hey, so my daughter is in my son
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.280]   and they got me into playing this thing.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.120]   Has you guys heard of Steam?
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.760]   >> Yeah, it's Valve's online distribution network.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.040]   >> Yeah, well, there's a game called Portal.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.600]   >> Portal's awesome.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.840]   >> See, everybody's playing it.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.240]   >> That comes with the orange box.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.080]   That's what the orange box--
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   >> People out there who want to check out an--
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.600]   you go online, you can download it,
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.920]   you can play it on your machine.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.360]   It wasn't quite--
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.320]   When I first saw it, I thought,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.200]   "Oh, here's another first-book person shooter."
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.040]   >> Not at all, yeah.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.720]   >> No, it's a puzzle game, actually.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   >> Right, right.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.680]   >> The end credits are the best.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   >> I haven't seen the end credits.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.560]   What's in the end credits?
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.200]   >> It's that Jonathan Colton song.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.040]   >> Oh, great.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.240]   >> I can't remember the woman who sings it, though,
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.320]   but it's kind of sung from the perspective
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.680]   of the main villain.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.280]   >> Oh, right. >> Fun.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.240]   >> Oh, I've got to get-- that's part of the orange box.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.040]   >> So you've beaten it, Tom?
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.240]   >> No, I've just gone to YouTube
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.280]   and listened to the end credits.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.960]   >> Oh, my daughter's beaten it.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.040]   My son and daughter have all beaten it.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.360]   So now I got 30 bucks down.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.280]   I have to beat it or I'm going to--
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.560]   it's going to cost me money.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.760]   >> It's called Still Alive.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.960]   You want to hear it?
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.600]   This is the end credit to a portal.

[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.600]   >> Well, your take's a while ago.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.240]   >> They're going to start singing at some point?
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   >> Yeah, they do.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.800]   >> Yeah, all right.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.160]   >> We'll echo in there.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.240]   >> Yeah, that's it.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.080]   That's so you can hear it.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.080]   I have to do that.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.000]   [dramatic music]
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.040]   >> Oh, it's pausing, too.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.480]   I don't know why it's pausing because it's--
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.520]   >> It has the internet.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.320]   >> The internet's broken again.

[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.760]   I guess I'm getting the whole credits, aren't I?
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.840]   >> Yeah, let me just get the song.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.680]   Let's just get the song.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.760]   This is the song by itself.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.320]   >> This was a triumph.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.560]   I'm making a note here.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.400]   Is this it?
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.240]   >> Six, six, six.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.560]   >> Yeah, that's it.

[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.000]   >> Yeah, well, that's why you're not at a radio station
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.840]   because there's no such thing that you describe.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.240]   >> Some smart program director?
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.080]   Yeah, you might be right.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.080]   >> I was kind of thinking the same thing.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.640]   [laughing]
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.560]   >> They don't even know.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.520]   They have no clue.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   So that's the closing theme from Portal,
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.800]   and you could find it on YouTube probably illegally,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.000]   and I probably played illegally, but--
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.080]   >> Or you can beat the game.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.320]   >> Beat the game.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.560]   I haven't had enough time to play it,
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.360]   but I've played it a little bit, and it really is fun.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.760]   You burn holes in--
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.600]   >> Everything.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.880]   >> Things, and then you go through the hole,
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.000]   but the puzzle is to get around in the game.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   It's really just Skokoban or something like that.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.640]   >> Yeah, it's a logic game.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.000]   It takes my daughter, says it's a 30-hour game.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.840]   >> That's a long time.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.880]   Nowadays, Halo wasn't even that long.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.120]   >> Yeah, that's what she said.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:58.960]   >> That's pretty good.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.920]   >> Maybe I got the number wrong.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.760]   Maybe 20.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.120]   >> The whole Portal burning thing
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.040]   is really taking over userfriendly.org.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.320]   I don't know if you read that comic.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.440]   >> Oh, really?
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.320]   He's got his characters burning holes
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.160]   and things all the time.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.000]   >> I love it.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.240]   >> So Larry Page getting married.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.560]   Anybody care?
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.720]   >> Oh, they can marry him for $3,500.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.240]   >> Oh, yeah, maybe he's looking for a minister.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.720]   He and his longtime girlfriend, Lucinda Soutworth.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.240]   Soutworth, see, she's just marrying him for the name,
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.360]   'cause he can't say Soutworth.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.240]   See, how many say Lucinda Soutworth?
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.280]   That is tough.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.920]   >> That poor woman's had that name her whole life.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.760]   Lucinda Soutworth.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.160]   That's a difficult thing to say.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.120]   Anyway, they're gonna be married
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.080]   at the Nectar Island, suitably named.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.440]   The Caribbean Hideaway owned by Virgin Group billionaire,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.600]   Richard Branson.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.200]   >> Well, yeah, let's go there.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.680]   >> On December, like, like, page 12,
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.520]   he needs about three reverence.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.240]   >> Yeah, I think we should, maybe we can be the,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.520]   yeah, the Trace Amigos reference.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.360]   >> Yeah, there we go.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.200]   >> Trace Padres.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.360]   >> Trace Padres.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.680]   (roars)
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.320]   >> And she's a doctoral student
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.560]   in biomedical informatics at Sanford University.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.520]   Has been for four years, so that may go on for a while.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.040]   >> Must have fascinating chit chat over the dinner table.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.280]   >> I didn't know that Sergey had already married.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.120]   >> I didn't either.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.080]   >> And in May, Sergey Brin was married
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.720]   to his longtime girlfriend, Anne Wojcicki.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.920]   >> I just don't keep up.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.640]   (laughs)
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.360]   I'm sorry, I don't know how I got to this gossip mode.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.840]   Beatles are gonna go digital next time.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.040]   >> Well, it is funny that Larry and Sergey,
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.720]   I'm sorry, but it is funny that Larry and Sergey do tend
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.200]   to gather some of this Hollywood-type gossip around.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.960]   The whole thing with the plane, the party plane,
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.600]   and then landing at the Moffat Field.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.800]   >> There would be no valley wag if it weren't for Larry,
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.040]   Sergey, and maybe a little bit of Kevin Rose thrown in
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.480]   just for fun, just for a dash of seasoning.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.320]   >> Kevin's looking different.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.840]   Have you seen him lately?
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.680]   >> I haven't.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.840]   >> Kevin stiffed us on cranky geeks.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.080]   >> Oh, he's busy.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.480]   He's got other things to do.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.920]   >> Well, I may have said he was gonna do it
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.760]   'til he never showed up.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.800]   We never heard from him.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.520]   >> Kevin Rose being a dark tip.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.000]   (laughing)
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.840]   >> On the dark tip.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.560]   >> I think he's losing it.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.480]   >> He's got a haircut.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.360]   He's got to be a $500 haircut.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.520]   You gotta see, it's this new haircut.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.640]   And it makes him look very much more mature.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.120]   Somebody said, Kevin, you gotta get it.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.960]   You can't look like a kid anymore.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.920]   You gotta get a better haircut.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.160]   >> Cut a $500 haircut.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.000]   >> It looks like it.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.840]   Look at it.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   It's definitely an amazing--
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.520]   >> I don't care.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.360]   >> You know what, I don't care.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.200]   >> You don't care.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.040]   >> I don't care.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.600]   >> We're letting news now, Kevin's here.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.760]   >> I'm just trying to--
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.680]   >> Man, I don't really care.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   >> Don't spice it up.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.640]   Try to spice it up.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.080]   All right, you want some hard news?
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.440]   Bruce Schneier, security expert,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.760]   is concerned the NIST, the National Institute for Standards
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   and Technology has released an encryption standard
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.280]   that Schneier says could very well have a backdoor,
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.240]   an NSA backdoor.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.080]   Now he says--
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.920]   >> Now how does--
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.760]   >> Well, that's it.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.280]   He says he's not asserting that it does,
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.920]   but we have no way of knowing whether it does
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.000]   and since it's not open,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.640]   and they're encouraging people to use this.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.680]   >> And it's a standard, so it should be open.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.200]   He says the algorithm could easily have a secret,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   the way it's designed, he says it could easily have
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   a secret backdoor, a secret number,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.240]   a master key in effect that would be able
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.320]   to decrypt content.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.720]   That's part of the,
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.360]   he seems to think that's part of the design
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.400]   which makes him think that the NSA must have a backdoor.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.680]   Why else would you design something
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   that could have a key like that?
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.040]   >> Yeah, of course.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.880]   >> Of course it does.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.000]   >> So it's got a backdoor.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.840]   >> Obviously.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840]   >> So don't use it.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.680]   >> Use something else,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   there's plenty of things out there.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.080]   >> Use RSA, use something that's open and known and safe.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.000]   >> I do have to say though,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.840]   I generally like to trust the National Institute
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.400]   of Standards and Technology.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.040]   >> Just the name alone.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.680]   >> Well, yeah, I mean it's a good thing to have
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.040]   an organization that just looks over standardization
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.960]   and says these are the things that everybody should use.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.480]   So it does kind of suck if they were to put out a standard
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.880]   for something like this that everybody was like,
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.320]   no way, I'm not going to use that
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.840]   because it sort of defeats the purpose of it.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.040]   >> Have to point out though that no way.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.120]   >> No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:13.960]   what's the purpose?
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.840]   The purpose to me of that group has always been,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.960]   you know, to define a foot,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.440]   to have a gold bar in a safe someplace
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.720]   that's exactly one foot long or to define.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.560]   >> How about a mound?
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.840]   >> What's a second?
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.360]   No, we like feet.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.920]   >> Those Europeans can use meters.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.120]   We're feet guys.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.400]   >> We are feet guys.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.760]   I like feet better.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.600]   >> This is an extension of that though, isn't it?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.320]   I mean saying like here's a standard
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.800]   for generating random numbers.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.600]   >> I think they're meddling.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.880]   Get back to the feet inches, ounces, grams,
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.680]   that kind of thing.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   >> Well, where's the grams come in?
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.080]   Now see there, now you gotta be careful.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.240]   You're mixing your metric with your imperial.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.960]   >> They can have grams, they can do grams.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.800]   They must have a gram.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.960]   Somebody's gotta hold the great gram.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.400]   >> Well, you know, the kilogram, is it the kilogram
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.920]   that's losing weight, is it?
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.240]   Yeah, we did the story.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.080]   >> Is it evaporating?
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.520]   Is the water evaporating?
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.360]   Isn't it a few big cities?
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.920]   >> They found that it's actually weighs
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.880]   the standard kilogram in Paris
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.720]   that's in the International Standards Bureau
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.520]   is losing weight and they don't know why.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.640]   >> I'll tell you why.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   It's the influence of Hote Couture.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.480]   >> How is that?
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.720]   'Cause models don't want to weigh so much.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.040]   >> Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.880]   >> It wouldn't work that way.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.960]   >> It's bad role models for the kilogram.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.800]   >> The kilogram is looking at these models
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.840]   and thinking I need to weigh less too.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.080]   >> But all they eat is steak and chips
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.720]   over there in France.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.520]   >> It's true, you were just, you were in Spain.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.480]   >> Steak, brit.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.320]   >> What are they eating?
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.160]   What are they eating?
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.000]   Bartholona.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.200]   >> Oh, they eat tapas.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.440]   Iberian ham.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.280]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.640]   Good stuff.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.200]   >> That Iberian ham is phenomenal.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.040]   >> Is it really?
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.240]   >> I think it's much better than prosciuto.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.080]   >> I love prosciuto.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.560]   So I might really love Iberian ham.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.080]   >> I just found a place in Oakland
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.280]   that actually has Iberian ham.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.120]   >> Is it really?
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.960]   >> Iberian ham?
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.640]   >> It's not one of the better ones.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.560]   I'm sure they feed the pigs acorns
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.400]   and if you go to the ham stores in Spain,
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.280]   they have these hams and some of them cost up
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.080]   to $100 a pound.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.000]   >> Well, yeah, they're just hanging there.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.080]   >> They're just hanging there.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.800]   >> They should, the good places shave it right off
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.760]   right before they serve it to you.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.240]   >> Now I want to go back.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.280]   All I had was paella.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.120]   >> Paella, paella, paella, paella.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.040]   >> I was a lobster.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.200]   >> I was a difor.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.400]   >> Should have had some ham.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.320]   You know, there's nothing to talk about this week.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.600]   (laughing)
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.280]   Okay, let me see.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.520]   There must be some more gossip.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.040]   >> Well, the SiriusXM merge are got okayed, right?
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.120]   >> Yeah, but not by the government,
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.360]   only by their shareholders.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.360]   That's not the big leap.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.120]   The big leap is getting the FCC to save.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.680]   >> Oh, the FCC should give up
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.520]   and let these guys have their satellite.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.440]   They're never going to make it.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.440]   We're going to lose both of them.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.280]   >> They're right.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.960]   >> That I'm joined because one of them
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.160]   is going to go broke before the other.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.920]   So right now it's a game of showdown.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.760]   Who's going to go broke first?
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.720]   So what's the point?
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.480]   >> Can they do it if they didn't allow
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.040]   direct TV and dish to merge several years back?
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.360]   Can they then go and make the same mark?
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.080]   >> Those guys aren't going on come bankrupt.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.440]   Of course, the point is that--
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.600]   >> Those guys are making money.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.840]   >> Right, trust these regulations aren't supposed
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.640]   to be a way of fixing market problems.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.520]   >> Right.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.800]   >> And if your market problem is nobody wants you.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.360]   >> I don't know.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.200]   >> No, but still,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.040]   they're going to be considering
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.120]   what's the circumstances of the merger.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.640]   And if you have two companies that are one of them
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.520]   are going to go broke leaving only one out there.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.360]   >> And there's no--
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.200]   >> You can't say--
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.040]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.880]   >> The logic of saying let's have the two who joined,
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.040]   there's only going to be one out there.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.440]   Say, well, there's only going to be one out there.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.280]   >> Either way, yeah.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.120]   >> There's only going to be one out there,
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.960]   no matter what you do.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.080]   >> Right, that's a good point.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.760]   I hope you go before the FCC and testify.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.200]   >> No, they'll never invite me to do anything.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.040]   Let's do it.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.040]   >> I don't know if satellite radio can even be saved
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.880]   with the merger.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.680]   >> Anyway.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.440]   You can say that, but I sure, you know,
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.960]   even though I've actually written negative articles
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.600]   about this, satellite radio is really cool.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.200]   I mean, I've, you know, rent cars a lot
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.280]   and I've always get a one with the satellite radio
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.880]   because most of them have it now.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.560]   And I have to say, you know, it's enjoyable
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.200]   to listen to some of these, the programming is good.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.880]   >> Hey, I do a show on satellite radio.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.000]   I'm on channel XM channel 158 every Saturday and Sunday.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.520]   >> I had an XM radio for a while and I really enjoyed--
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.360]   >> Well, see it.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.200]   >> There you go.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.960]   >> And then I got rid of it
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.000]   and I don't miss it.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:19.840]   >> Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.920]   You don't have to have it.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.880]   It's good if you've got it, but you don't have to have it.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.800]   >> Right, I agree.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.680]   >> Nothing pushing you to do it.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.840]   >> It's good for truckers and rental cars.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.840]   >> Great for truckers.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.920]   And yeah, good for rental cars too.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.880]   All right, well, let's see more gossip.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.960]   We found out who ran the funded.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.040]   Do you like this?
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:38.880]   >> The random, who, what?
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.600]   >> You know, the funded site, thefunded.com,
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.480]   which is a gossip site about venture capitalists
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.520]   in which people who've taken money can diss their VC
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.400]   and private.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.760]   >> It's like S company for venture capitalists.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.320]   >> Yeah, exactly what it is.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.480]   Turns out the guy running the funded,
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.200]   he calls himself Ted, is not Ted.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.440]   It's a Deo Rossi.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.080]   Resi, who cares?
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.920]   I don't care.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.760]   >> What about him?
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.680]   >> That's who it is.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   >> Well, so what?
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.760]   >> Who's a Deo Rossi?
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.600]   >> I don't know.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.040]   >> No, I mean, he started a couple companies,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.880]   but I don't know.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.720]   >> Yeah, he's taking venture funding
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   and apparently he was the guy, I don't know.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.680]   All right, you're right, I don't care.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.200]   >> No, we do care, but we don't have any background here.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.280]   You're just throwing names out.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.760]   >> So there's a site called the funded.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.280]   It was like F2 company that,
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.440]   and part of the game was who would be bold enough
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.840]   to start this site because you're basically
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.200]   kicking venture capitalists where the sun don't shine?
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.280]   >> Which means you're never gonna get venture funding ever.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.040]   >> Right, which is why he stayed anonymous.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.120]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.640]   He's had several startups.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.200]   He's taking money for venture capital several times.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.320]   Method five was a web development firm.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.520]   He sold for $88 million.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.400]   >> So the board of the X-prize Foundation, yeah.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.040]   >> He's complaining.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.680]   >> Well, he's, you know what he's doing?
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.120]   And I think it's probably a public service
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.800]   is telling people what you trade
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.960]   when you get money from the venture funds.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.120]   >> Yeah, you trade part of the company.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.960]   What do you expect?
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.120]   You're getting money.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.760]   >> You know, but you get people on there saying,
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.080]   you know, my VC forced me to sell to somebody
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.280]   just 'cause it was a sister firm,
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.960]   and you know, they had another investment of theirs.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.400]   And nobody forces anybody to do it.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.920]   You can always resign.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.880]   >> Yeah, but then you've lost your company.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.760]   >> Well, I think you still have shares.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.680]   >> True.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.280]   >> I mean, I like the idea of the fund,
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.560]   not that I'm in this business at all
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.760]   or really know that much about it,
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.920]   but it seemed like a good idea to me,
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.040]   which was if you're out there pitching to these guys,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.560]   here's a place to kind of get the scoop
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.880]   about what they're like without the risk of, you know,
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.720]   offending them.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.240]   So you get some honest opinions rather than people saying,
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.360]   you know, blathering on about how great they are,
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.400]   'cause they don't want to offend them.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.960]   So it's a good backdoor information source, I would guess.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.800]   >> Absolutely.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   In fact, some VC funds have actually gone on there
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.040]   to apologize to say, you know,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.080]   I'm sorry that's your bad experience.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.400]   Let me make it up to you.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.280]   >> Give us your name and phone number,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.360]   we'll be right over.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.920]   (laughing)
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.600]   >> I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.880]   Well, anyway, I don't know.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.320]   I'm looking, I'm searching,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.320]   I'm scraping the bottom of the door.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.240]   >> I know, we're putting you in the spot here, Leo.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.960]   >> I've got to find another one.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.120]   I'll find it, here's another, here's a big story.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:22.760]   Apple admits to misleading leopard firewall settings.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.480]   Three serious design weaknesses in leopard.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.800]   But they have shipped a fix.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.880]   Apple admitted that block all incoming connections
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.600]   doesn't really block all incoming connections, actually.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.240]   So, but they're going to fix it.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.280]   >> Yeah, well, they've fixed it.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.000]   >> It should block all incoming connections.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.960]   It's off.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.600]   Is it the deal with the leopard firewall too,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.920]   that it's off by default?
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.760]   >> Yes.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.600]   >> You have to go in and turn it on.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.680]   >> Yeah, but then even when you turn it on,
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.320]   it doesn't do anything, apparently.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.440]   >> You know, if you want to block,
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.160]   it is really easy to block all incoming connections.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.000]   >> Well, how do you do that?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.840]   >> On the network.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840]   >> Yeah, there you go.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.520]   >> We only want to block some incoming connections, I guess.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.600]   Anyway, they're going to,
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.400]   if you've patched it, there is a fix.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.240]   And now it says, instead of blocking incoming connections,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.800]   it says, allow only essential services.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.000]   >> That's the fix. >> Whatever that means.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.960]   >> That's the fix, it changed the language.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.120]   Google has said, yes, we're going to bid,
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.160]   we're going to try to buy this 700 megahertz spectrum.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.960]   That's a big deal.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   They are going to finance the four picks points.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.520]   I don't know why they would have to finance it,
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.880]   the $4.6 billion bid.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.480]   >> Yeah, don't they have that like in the petty cash drawer?
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.920]   >> I think Larry could get that out of the seat.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.400]   >> It's in the back seat of the Boeing 767 sitting there.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.600]   >> They're in the seat cushions.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.280]   It's on the gift table, it is a wedding.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.120]   So what are they going to,
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.200]   we've talked about this before, what are they going to do with that?
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.920]   >> Everybody thinks they're going to do some sort of a phone.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.760]   >> Well, they are doing it.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.000]   >> What's the funny thing about this announcement is,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.480]   we've all speculated so much about Google getting
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.240]   into the 700 megahertz spectrum.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.720]   But them saying, yeah, we're really going to do it.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.720]   It was sort of non-plusing.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.040]   >> Like, so big deal.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040]   >> Yeah, we all kind of figured it.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:00.880]   >> We knew you were.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.200]   >> So what are you going to do with it?
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.800]   >> We paid good. >> So what's going to happen?
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.880]   >> We nailed it.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.920]   >> But I guess it is significant because it does mean that Google
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.120]   would be getting into something that's a little bit deviating
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.520]   from their mission of organizing those information.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:21.000]   I mean, it is more on the side of making it easily accessible.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.320]   And I don't know that they have the expertise to run a network, do they?
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.480]   >> I just love the idea of having--
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.880]   >> They only run the biggest network in the world.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.560]   >> Yeah, but not a public, not a cell phone network.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.720]   They run an internet network.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.320]   But I love the idea of them opening this up and making it open
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.000]   and kind of sticking it to the cell phone companies.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.720]   Saying this is how it should be done.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.200]   You know, I was talking to somebody--
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.760]   who was it?
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.680]   Who said that these guys--
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.960]   I think it was Jason Calicana's last week, I think.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.400]   Said that these guys at Google really do take this idea
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.320]   of their kind of stewardship of the internet seriously.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.920]   They really do want to do no evil.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.000]   They really do want to build a company that opens things.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.480]   They believe in openness.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.280]   >> So I guess he's looking for money from them, huh?
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.440]   >> Maybe that's it.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.440]   >> Well, here's--
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.080]   >> I didn't ask him, but he doesn't need money.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:12.920]   He's got money.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.480]   >> You know, I love those Google guys.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.160]   >> Oh, you know, I'm interested to hear that though.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.640]   I wondered, does anybody have the impression
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.360]   that Google is evil?
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.160]   >> They've been getting more and more negative press
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.080]   than they used to.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.000]   There was a Cinderella period for a while
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.080]   that could do no wrong.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:29.920]   >> Right.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.720]   >> And now there's privacy in them buying double click
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.800]   and are they gathering too much--
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.640]   >> That was the first--
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.480]   >> The fiction about you and--
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.080]   >> Shinking the wall wasn't a double click.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.920]   That didn't look so nice.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.800]   Maybe they bought them though to put them out of business.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.480]   >> We believe--
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.320]   >> That was their way of--
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.840]   >> I want to believe in fairy tales.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   >> Yeah, you apparently.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.640]   >> They're going to buy Enron next.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.480]   (laughing)
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.120]   You know, think about it though,
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.480]   with the 700 megahertz spectrum,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.560]   you've got Google owns all this dark fiber, right?
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.480]   >> Right.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.800]   >> And then you've got these container truck data centers now
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.160]   that I think Sun makes.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.000]   >> Right.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.840]   >> Where you can just go dump a truck off in the middle.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.440]   >> All you gotta do is run power and water to it for cooling.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.680]   They could just blanket the country
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.760]   with these data centers hooked up to the dark fiber,
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.120]   broadcasting over the 700 megahertz spectrum.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.640]   >> And suddenly the entire nation is wired.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.920]   Wiredlessly.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.920]   >> Impossible.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.320]   >> Infinclients.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.480]   >> The Gphone is the--
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.320]   >> Inclients.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.160]   >> Exactly.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.000]   >> Now you can make--
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.840]   >> Exactly.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.680]   >> And there's money to be made on that
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.800]   because they put the advertising on that sucker.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.840]   >> There's money to do lost.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.600]   I'm telling you, it's the worst business in the world.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.440]   >> It is?
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.240]   >> These guys are gonna lose their butts on this deal.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.080]   >> I don't know.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.440]   I think the wireless spectrum is a pretty valuable commodity
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.440]   to have no matter what you do with it.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.560]   >> Well, I'm not arguing that.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.360]   I'm just saying it's a tough business.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.880]   >> I agree with that, like getting in there,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.480]   but maybe they lease it.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.920]   >> Google isn't-- >> Gives it the condition.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.760]   >> I don't know.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.960]   >> And that's sort of what they're doing with the phone,
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.280]   which is smart, saying like, hey, we should improve their--
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.400]   >> They're software.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.760]   >> Maybe they should improve their search engine a little bit.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.000]   How about that for an idea?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.920]   >> Oh, no, they got other fish.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.800]   >> This is another typical company that gets--
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.760]   they get distracted.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.120]   Oh, we gotta do this, we gotta do this.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.840]   Like Microsoft is the worst for this.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.800]   These guys have dropped in the ball
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.560]   and all kinds of things going left and right.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.520]   Now they're chasing Google for some unknown reason.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.480]   And everybody takes-- they walk away
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.040]   from their core competencies where they own a market
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.440]   and they go after stuff they don't know anything about.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.080]   And then they stumble and fumble
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.960]   and then there's all kinds of reports that come out later
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.600]   about, well, how we made a mistake here
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.640]   and we made a mistake there.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.480]   Meanwhile, the shareholders should have been getting that money.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.040]   >> Well, and it's the shareholders
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.840]   that are pushing them to diversifying,
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.320]   to grow and go into new things,
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.720]   which forces them to get away from their core.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.120]   >> They have to maintain that growth rate.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   >> Oh, I don't know that's true.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.200]   >> But you're right, it's happened in Microsoft,
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.760]   happened to Yahoo, it's happened to Sony.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.080]   I mean, you could see the failures all
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.520]   through the industrial world.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.440]   If you just sit on your core competency,
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.840]   then you get criticized for not trying to grow the company.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.880]   >> Right.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.440]   Well, you gotta maintain these crazy growth rates.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.920]   The market expects you to maintain a growth rate
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.480]   that's insane that you can't maintain.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.160]   >> Microsoft, here's the best example.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.960]   Microsoft's growth rate has gone,
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.520]   has continued on at whatever it is,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.920]   25, 30% a year, whatever, maybe more,
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.520]   marching away only from the monies they make
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.600]   from their core competencies and all the money
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.480]   that they're losing from these other crazy ideas
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.360]   that are supposedly the shareholders are demanding.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.800]   They diversify, I don't see what shareholders these are
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.840]   that are making these assertions because it's crazy.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.120]   If Microsoft stuck with his core competencies,
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.520]   they'd own the place.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   >> Well, that's a rational way of looking at it.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.360]   (laughing)
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.840]   >> All right, before we run completely out of stories,
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.880]   I am going to do our audible pitch.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.240]   >> Yeah, we just groucing.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.480]   >> This is the grousing episode.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.880]   Three ministers got together to grouse.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.360]   >> Start up some kind of joke.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.440]   >> Yeah, I know, they walk into a bar.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.400]   You know, we should really recommend some business books.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.760]   If you're interested, Bill Gates,
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.600]   in really learning what to do with Microsoft,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.440]   you might want to check out audible.com.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.760]   Look at the business collection.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   They've got all sorts of great books.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.360]   You can even listen to the Harvard Business Review,
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.280]   month by month.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.560]   Of course, the classics like How to Win Friends
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.160]   and Influence People are seven habits
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.400]   of highly effective people.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.600]   They're all there.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.880]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Twit.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.720]   And you know what?
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.760]   If you go to audible.com/twit, you get a free book.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.400]   So just to sign up today, get a credit,
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.880]   I think one of the books I'd like to recommend
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.680]   is a fascinating subject called Microtrends.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.680]   Have you guys read up on this?
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.120]   The theory is that 1% is enough to create any trend
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.080]   and that the smaller trends, eventually snowball
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.880]   into bigger trends, but they go unnoticed or un-ignored.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.320]   And yet you can identify microtrends
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.520]   that are going to be very, very significant.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.480]   It's a fascinating book.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.760]   Mark Penn wrote it with Kinney Zelesny.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.040]   Microtrend.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:53.840]   What are you laughing at?
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.760]   Who comes up with these ideas?
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.240]   You've got to read this.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.400]   It's fascinating.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.320]   All right, I'll get it.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.160]   It's fast.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.000]   1% the one--
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.840]   Or send me your copy.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.200]   I will.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.920]   The reason I like it is because we're in that 1% trend.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.480]   I mean, that's what podcasting really is.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.200]   If this kind of show can get 1% of the audience,
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.760]   it's enough to create an avalanche, a world change--
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.560]   Do you have to get a quality audience?
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.320]   No, it doesn't matter.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.160]   Anybody.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.520]   You need to get the impumbs off the screen.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.240]   1% quality audience for this show is never going to happen.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.000]   Bums off the street.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.600]   It doesn't matter.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.040]   Anybody.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.760]   As long as you get 1%, that's all it takes.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.800]   I don't know.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.200]   Does that work for presidential candidates?
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   Yes, anybody.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.480]   I think we've got the 1%.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.800]   But this is the most popular podcast there is.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.560]   I think it is.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.840]   Hard to believe, actually.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.600]   I don't know.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.920]   Maybe not anymore.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:46.160]   So audible.com/twit is the site.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.240]   Great choices.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.200]   45,000 plus titles.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.560]   Runs on hundreds of different devices.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.640]   You can even burn to CD.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.800]   I'll burn this book to CD and send it to a John C.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.520]   Dvorak so he can listen to it too.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.360]   It is a really great way to get reading done.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.200]   How many CDs does it hold?
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.080]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.400]   It's a lot of CDs when you burn.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.440]   I just prefer to put it on.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.040]   I'll tell you what.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:05.800]   I'll give you an iPod.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.880]   It's easier.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.920]   I'll just put it on an iPod and give it to you.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.320]   All right.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.440]   I got them lying on.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   You have to throw it in there with the box with the microphone.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.240]   Oh, yeah, that.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.560]   You don't need my mic anymore.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.200]   You've got Podshow giving you crap left and right.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   I got a good mic here.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.480]   Yeah, and Podshow gave it to already.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.400]   I got a mic here.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.040]   He's got a little serial number on it.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.720]   When I'm gone, I have to give it back to him.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.560]   Oh, it's got that inventory tag?
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.640]   Like Ziff Davis used to do?
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.240]   No, everything's inventory.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.880]   Well, that's like a real company.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.160]   Except, yeah, it's like a real company.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.080]   It's like the cables.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.560]   So if you can get enough cables,
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.360]   you can make money on the deal because the cables are kind of free.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.680]   They're not labeled.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.560]   Just pull the copper wiring out of the wall.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.880]   I have a DIMO labeler.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.800]   I put property of Twitter on everything.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.280]   But I don't know if that way has to--
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:49.960]   Property of Twitter.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   You know, I should do--
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960]   I put all the Ziff Davis over, dude.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.560]   I should put a fake serial number on it,
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.240]   and like a phony barcode.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:55.800]   Oh, I like it.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.240]   So we've got an inventory system.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.120]   Yeah, you should, just to fool the rooms.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.600]   Yes, we've got an inventory system.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.800]   So anyway, audible.com/trit.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.880]   By the way, good time now through November 20th,
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.840]   half price sale, 1,000 plus unabridged titles,
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.800]   including the Quicksilver series.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.240]   If you want to listen to those great Neil Stevenson books
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.200]   that I can't get through, but I hear are wonderful.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.720]   He was on Cranky Geeks.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.600]   Where do you get bogged down with them?
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.160]   The very first-- I mean, about halfway through the Quicksilver,
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.200]   I just-- it's like, I just-- you know what?
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.040]   I'm not as literate as you, Tom, and I just can't follow it.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.800]   Tom is the most literate person on the show.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.640]   I don't know about that.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.320]   I'm weak after the most stubborn.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.720]   I won't stop.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.680]   I just keep reading.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.560]   Maybe that's it.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.640]   It's such a-- you know, anyway.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.680]   If I hadn't lost the Sony ebook reader,
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.120]   I'd be reading it right now.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.640]   You're still-- you're still irked about that.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.440]   What airline was it?
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.800]   Did they get it back for you?
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   It was Air Canada.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.240]   No.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.920]   Can you call them?
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.680]   I just figured the stewardess probably took it.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.520]   I would have.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.800]   You might have tried, call Austin found.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.920]   They've got an interesting thing here.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.920]   I don't know what this means.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.480]   Audible has Cryptonomicon, which is my favorite book
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.640]   of all time practically.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.920]   I love Cryptonomicon.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.360]   I didn't mean to go back and reread them.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.000]   Yeah, I have to.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.080]   We'll get the Audible version.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   Except I don't understand here.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.200]   It says, unabridged excerpts.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.320]   What does that mean?
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.120]   It talks you more on.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:17.760]   It is.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.040]   Well, the excerpts have not been edited.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.600]   It says, unabridged excerpts.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.360]   I don't know what that means.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:26.840]   That's right.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.160]   Name for a blog out there, you people.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.800]   The publisher explains, "I felt that given the style of the book,
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.320]   a normal abridgment would not work.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   The book is 900 pages.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.360]   So I selected key scenes and then added short plot
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.840]   bridges approved by the author that would allow the listener
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.640]   to follow the story.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.200]   No, you know what?
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.280]   Don't get this.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.400]   That's abridged.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.360]   That's abridged.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.520]   Get unabridged, Neil Stevens and stuff.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.520]   I understand that.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.440]   It's like those catch up on lost episodes where they just show you
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.320]   pieces of every episode so far.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.320]   That's not good.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.600]   I wonder if they have the Toynbee's "The Study of History."
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.960]   That was a great book.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.760]   Do you think Toynbee was a crack?
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.600]   Well, did you read?
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.440]   No, I met the guy.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:12.960]   Did you read the 13 volumes or did you just read the short version?
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.320]   No, I haven't read it.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.960]   I've read Will Durant's.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.960]   Oh, no, it's different.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.320]   I have an abridged version of Toynbee.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.280]   I didn't know it was 13 volumes.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.280]   Yeah, it's pretty long.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.080]   But his thesis, which is pretty easy to explain,
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.680]   is that cultures succeed or fail, depending on climate.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.160]   You know, civilizations and that's not what-- that is not it
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:30.680]   at all.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.160]   But that's a nice try.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.520]   Well, that northerners are more complicated.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.240]   So it's a little more complicated than that.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.160]   We're thinking of Spangler.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.600]   No, Spangler's different again.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.480]   Spangler is another character who's in the same genre.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.720]   Only, Spangler did a two volume set called the--
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.800]   what was the client of the West.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.000]   And it's actually-- I read the Spangler.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.560]   Spangler's two books are quite interesting.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.600]   But the thing about those two books
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.000]   is that about halfway through volume two, it just dies.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.600]   It's like he ran out and he said--
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.640]   I just imagine looking at the book 50--
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   he says, this book is so much thicker than this one.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   I'm going to have to add more crap to it.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.160]   I identify what you did.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.840]   And so he writes a bunch of boring junk.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.440]   What?
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.280]   I completely identify what them, actually.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.080]   I've had that happen, but not after a whole volume,
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.160]   mostly after about half in an hour.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.960]   So isn't Toynbee, though, often considered kind of a crackpot?
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.800]   No, never.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   There's not one person in the world that considers him a crackpot.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.480]   Have you read all 13 volumes?
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.720]   I have, as a matter of fact.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.040]   Wow.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.040]   I'm going to have to get to it.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.800]   They do not have that on Audible.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.480]   I'm going to have to read that in print.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.000]   There is a condensed version that some guy wrote that--
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.480]   That's what I've read.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.280]   Yeah, it's two volumes.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.160]   And Toynbee, the guy-- this is interesting,
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.360]   so I can't remember his name off-handed to come to me
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.080]   in a minute, but this guy wanted to understand Toynbee better,
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.360]   so he started to outline it and write his--
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.400]   he wrote a two-volume condensation,
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.200]   so he can read the whole-- all the theses,
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:53.720]   all at once.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.240]   Toynbee got a hold of it.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.800]   And so this is fantastic.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.120]   This two volumes get any talk to his publisher
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.960]   into publishing the two volumes for people
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.760]   who don't want to read all the long stuff.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.480]   Must be what I read.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.440]   Did it have pictures?
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:06.880]   No.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.640]   There is a picture version.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.120]   There's a picture version of the book that came out about--
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.000]   That's the one I've read.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.320]   In the '80s, I believe, and it's called the same thing,
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.000]   a study of civilization and--
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.080]   I think it was one I've read.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.920]   A study of history is the name of it.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.240]   And anyway, it's got-- I don't know where this book came from.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.960]   I think it was printed.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.720]   I don't even know who-- remember, I have a copy.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.160]   It's horrible.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.200]   That's why I think it's all about climate,
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.280]   because that's the one I read.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.600]   It's got nothing to do with anything.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.440]   I don't know--
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.040]   Guns, Gerbs, and Steel.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.240]   That's a great book.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.560]   No, I read that picture version, and I think
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.800]   it was in high school, but I liked it.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.880]   It's got nothing to do with anything.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.080]   I mean, I don't even know where that book--
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.160]   I looked at this book and I'm thumbing through one day.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.480]   I'm going, this book has got-- it's ridiculous.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.800]   It doesn't really do the job.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.840]   Join me, argue that civilizations die from suicide,
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.040]   not by murder.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:54.920]   No, he does.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.720]   He has a bunch of different-- the thing is,
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.720]   there's more than one way, but his main thesis
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.000]   is that civilizations have a life of their own,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.560]   and they come and they go--
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.280]   It's a cycle.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.200]   And then the cycle--
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   Much like a business cycle.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.280]   He kind of.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.920]   I hate to be reminded of that.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.120]   But anyway, that book needs to be finished.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:13.640]   Anyways--
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.720]   Well, sometimes they die when they shift their enemies--
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.000]   For people out there who want to read some real fun stuff--
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.160]   well, fun-- not real fun.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:21.680]   Fascinating.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.080]   That's interesting.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:22.880]   Fascinating.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.640]   Is the study of history by Arnold Toymie.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.800]   Read the volume, start with volume one,
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.840]   and start to fly one through.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.760]   It'll take you about four years.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.160]   I'm going to do it.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:31.680]   I'm going to do it.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.080]   And I'll report back to you, John, when I understand it.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.360]   The footnotes are absolutely amazing.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.080]   I love history.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.960]   I talked to an English woman a while ago.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.760]   She said, "Americans love history
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.040]   because you don't have any history.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.160]   We're so bored with it."
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.200]   That's not true of all English that I've ever--
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.480]   No, affect many English books.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.080]   Just that woman that Leo ran into.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:51.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:51.880]   It was her.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.880]   She thought it.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   Anyway, you can't get all 12 volumes of Toymie
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.520]   on Audible, but you can't get many wonderful books.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.920]   Elissis?
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.960]   Yeah, I bet you could.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.120]   Oh, Elissis is the one to listen to.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.240]   U-L-Y-S-S-E-S, right?
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.280]   Elissis, let's see if they have it on the search here.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.480]   They do have U-Lissis.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   They probably have a production version of it.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.000]   Who reads Finnegan's Wake, then?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.080]   They're not going to have Finnegan's Wake.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.400]   You can't even-- I tried to read the first paragraph,
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.360]   "Finniggan's Wake," and I passed out in a faint.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:24.920]   Yeah, this is--
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.080]   That's the idea, Leo.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.080]   That's what it's supposed to do.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.440]   I read it all out to my daughter.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.320]   She said, "Was he joking?"
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.400]   I said, "I don't think so.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.200]   I think he was serious.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.240]   They do not have Finnegan's Wake on Audible.com."
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:41.400]   But every other book, 45,000 plus titles, Audible.com/Twit.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.840]   And we thank them for their support this week in tech.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.040]   So the Beatles, Paul McCartney says the Beatles
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.720]   are going digital, going online soon.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.200]   It's pretty much the only one left.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.480]   I mean, I know there's Ringo, but he gets to make the call.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.360]   The Beatles.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:56.960]   It's the Beatles.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.200]   I guess the estates of the--
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:58.720]   The Beatles.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.320]   The Beatles says 2008, though, which is a little disappointing.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.320]   I thought it'd be sooner than that.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   Well, how long is it?
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   It would take.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   When did they go public domain in UK?
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.320]   It's like 2012.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.320]   It's not that long after.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.320]   You think you'd want to get in there as soon as possible.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.320]   No, I think that's all.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.320]   No, that public domain thing is--
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.320]   Now it's a--
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.320]   I think it's an international law
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.320]   where everything is adopted to 150-year standard.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   Not unless they sign the treaty.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.320]   In other words, 75 years after his death or something like that,
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   I don't think that the--
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   I didn't think you did sign yet, but--
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.320]   No.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.320]   I think that's all in play.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.320]   The towers--
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.320]   I think our kids and everybody after us are never going to understand what public domain
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.320]   even is except Dickens.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   Exactly.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:48.320]   The issue is they want to harmonize the British law with this international law.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   But the government hasn't agreed yet.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   They haven't acted on its notions.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:58.320]   So if the government does not act, then the Beatles will come out of copyright in 2012.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.320]   2012, okay.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.320]   But they certainly will act.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.320]   They certainly--
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.320]   And meanwhile, they'll be able to sell plenty of digital versions before that.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.320]   Yeah, lots of time.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.320]   But hurry up, Sir Paul.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   I don't have anything else to say.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.320]   I just want to thank--
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.320]   Well, it's going to be the biggest shopping day of the year on Friday, right?
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.320]   Black Friday.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   So what a poor name.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.320]   Can we come up with a better name for this?
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.320]   Fun Friday.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.320]   Fun, busy Friday.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.320]   It's a Friday.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   Black Friday sounds like a stock market crash.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.320]   What a crappy--
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.320]   Do you even need the Friday anymore?
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.320]   There are so many online deals.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.320]   Yeah, I buy now.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.320]   I buy-- you know, and there's no Black Monday anymore, Cyber Monday, because people don't
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   wait to go to work to shop online.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.320]   They shop online all the time.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   I agree.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:47.320]   This is the one year where I feel like there really just isn't anything big gadget-wise,
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.320]   technology-wise, for the holiday season.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   You've got--
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.320]   There's the E-way limit.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.320]   There's the--
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   You can't get away.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.320]   You get the Aces EP-ly.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.320]   The APC.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.320]   The APC is cool.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.320]   I love my EPC.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   You can get an OLPC, and then kind of give a gift of charity and have a gift to give.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   That's the feel-good gift.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.320]   That's the feel-good gift.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.320]   And that's $3.99.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.320]   It's an expensive feel-good.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.320]   You pay the price to feel good.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.320]   Have you played-- anybody play with the OLPC?
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.320]   I played with it a bit at CES last year.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   And I don't know how much they've changed it.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   I think it changed a lot.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.320]   The thing that was the most cool about it was the mesh networking.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:23.320]   They had it demonstrated where they-- they only had one computer hooked up to the Internet,
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.320]   but you could surf off of all of them.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:31.320]   You can send, you know, Nigerian email scams from like 20 of them with only one dial-up.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   It's really great.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   First Nigerian email scam to actually come from Nigeria.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.320]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   Then it would be a scam.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.320]   They'd just be true.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   I was reading Parade Magazine this week.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.320]   It's their technology, their yearly technology issue.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   It's so dumbed down.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   It's kind of sad.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:54.320]   But they do have a big ad saying, "This man, it's a guy with tattoos and a mohawk,
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:59.320]   is a Eastern European lottery official who says you've won."
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.320]   And it's explaining why-- and it's actually a good ad.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   I'm glad somebody's running this.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.320]   I don't know who's paying for it, but it's explaining why you actually haven't won the Romanian lottery.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.320]   I guess they have to do that.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.320]   I got a good one.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.320]   I got a good one the other day because there's a lot of the ones that are now
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:28.320]   called the misdirect type where this guy says, "Hey, I got that $10 million deposit in an account you wanted,
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.320]   and it's sitting there ready for you, but you're going to have to get a hold of so-and-so idea.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.320]   They haven't heard back from you."
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   I guess to find some bonehead who actually believes that by accident,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:46.320]   he's got access to $10 million because he has to have a fee to pay for some charge.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.320]   There was a great New Yorker article.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.320]   I'm sure you read this time a couple of years ago about a guy who fell for a 4.1.9 scam.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.320]   This guy was like a minister.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.320]   The article is called "The Perfect Mark."
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   And he was an ordained minister.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.320]   He was a psychotherapist.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   He was fairly comfortable.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   He basically squandered everything.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   He refused to ever believe that he was being taken advantage of.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   The money was always just around the corner with some widow, and he believed he was helping her.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   Wow.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   It's a fascinating, a must-read article.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   Mitchell Zukoff wrote it.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.320]   It was about, I think it was May, I actually have it in front of me right now, May 2006.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.320]   Will to believe, very strong.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   Very interesting.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   Anyway, I'm going to wrap this up.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.320]   I think it's been fun talking to you guys.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:40.320]   I'm sorry to bore you with such lousy stories, but maybe next time we'll have something interesting to talk about.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.320]   Anything's possible.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   Yeah, the news never plays fair with you.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   It doesn't.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.320]   You know, you get to do it.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.320]   Hey, you know, it's always, by the way, it's always slow.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:53.320]   The last two weeks in November for news, I mean, this has been going on forever since I started writing.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.320]   I know.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.320]   This is, everybody's going to announce anything now.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.320]   Yeah, it's all been announced.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.320]   It's all about waiting to see that the sales figures ring up.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   Have you two noticed this with Buzz out loud that you go through cycles where they're just really, I mean, you have to do that every day.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.320]   There are some days where you're pulling your hair out.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:23.320]   We do a lot of science stories as kind of later is to sort of buffer that, you know, things about quantum cryptography and entanglement and that's clever.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:28.320]   So just like a kind of another topic that you could expand out into if things are really slow in the tech realm.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:35.320]   Yeah, it's not too far afield to talk about controlling limb, artificial limbs tied into your brain.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   They do that.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.320]   That's not too far out.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   That's a minute now.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.320]   We talk about cooking and food with John.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   That's what we do.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   Iberian ham.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.320]   Why?
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.320]   Toynbee.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   Toynbee.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.320]   It's always good.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.320]   Maybe we should stick with the artificial limbs.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.320]   That might be better.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.320]   Toynbee.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   Anyway, Tom Merritt is one of the hosts with Molly Wood of the great Buzz out loud at CNET buzz.cNET.com.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   That's actually B-O-L.cNET.com.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:03.320]   B-O-L.cNET.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.320]   CNET.com takes you to Molly's own page.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.320]   Now you do this CNET Live.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.320]   Tell me about that.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   It may sound familiar.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.320]   It's a call-in show.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   A live call-in show every day.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.320]   It's a live half hour video call-in show.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:22.560]   Usually it's me and Brian Cooley, although as schedules happen, different people have
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.560]   hosted it.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:27.320]   Molly Wood and Donald Bell did it on this past Thursday and did a great job.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.320]   It's just a call-in show.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.320]   We have guests who do some help segments and take calls.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.320]   CNET.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   CNET.com.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.320]   Is that where you go?
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   Yep, that's right.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:42.320]   Boy, between that and now the live stuff that Revision 3 is about to do, and I talk to-
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.320]   What are they going to do?
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.320]   They built a live studio.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   Well, TEXILLA is going to go live.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.320]   Actually, Patrick was supposed to join us, but I think the baby called, but they're going
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.320]   to start doing TEXILLA live.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.320]   Take live calls.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.320]   They build a live studio.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.320]   Everybody's copying your old formula, Leo.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.320]   No, it's me.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.320]   I'm sitting here just doing this.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   You're going to use a CAF or the syndicate-
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.320]   I still do the radio show.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   I do the lab up at Canada.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.320]   I'm still doing it.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.320]   You're all over the field.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.320]   I like more of it.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.320]   All of us combined.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.320]   I want to do more live streaming stuff.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   You could do it now without having a big budget with stuff like Ustream.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.320]   In fact, we've been streaming this live over Ustream.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   I think that's kind of interesting.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   Anyway, just a thought.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   What are you doing with PODShow these days, Mr. Dvorak?
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.320]   Well, I got the tech five thing this daily.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   Check that out at tech5.podshow.com.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:37.320]   Also, the one that's kind of sneaking up, which -- and this is not a clone of a Leo show.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.760]   I do something with Adam Curry called Noah Jenda, which we run on Fridays, and it's about
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.160]   anything but tech.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.320]   Oh, I like that.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.520]   So basically, we sit and grouse because he's grousing from England about England in the
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.520]   United States.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:51.520]   I'm grousing from the United States.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.520]   That's actually a great idea.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.560]   Because you're both the religion people with lots of things to talk about.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.560]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.560]   Well, we've got around the block.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.400]   I don't know how intelligent we are.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.840]   But whatever the case is, I grouse about stuff, and he grouses about stuff.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:08.080]   And, you know, after 30 minutes, we get sick of each other and hang up.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   I love it.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.000]   It's very therapeutic, isn't it?
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   You know what?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.280]   The funny thing is people listen to it.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   That's what's really frightening.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.800]   Well, that's kind of what Roger Chagan and I do on East Meets West.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.800]   Same sort of idea.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.240]   And it is amazing people like, "I love it."
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.320]   You and Roger go back and forth about the same thing.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.240]   Yeah, they're just talking about whatever's on our minds.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.280]   Oh, no, maybe that's what we sold the idea for.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.280]   We sold the idea from you.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   We didn't even know it.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.720]   There's no new ideas under the sun.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.720]   I swear to God.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:36.320]   Actually, on Tech 5 on Friday, you were talking about Microsoft buying Yahoo.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.280]   You still think that's going to happen?
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.600]   I talked about it, but I still don't think it's a good idea and I think it's nutty.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:46.080]   And I think it's like Microsoft admitting failure.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.360]   Two companies that have lost their way joining together to make a company.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.960]   Well, it sounds like HP Compaq.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:52.960]   It's terrible.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   I mean, it's a whole lot more.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   I know, well, time and humiliation.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   Somewhere between HP Compaq and AOL Time Warner.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.960]   That's how you...
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.840]   Yeah, somewhere in the hole in the ground.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   A portal.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.920]   Gentlemen, I thank you for joining us.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   I really appreciate it.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   Devorect.org/blog.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.320]   You didn't say it once, John.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:12.600]   I was actually keeping track because I had a bottle of Stolich Nia here.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.360]   Yeah, well, I didn't want to get you drunk.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   I was ready.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.960]   If you'd said it four or five times, I would have fallen off the ball.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   I would have said it if I'd known that.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.960]   Said what?
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:23.960]   Devorect.org/blog.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.760]   Give me that bottle.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   Another twist.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.920]   This is amazing.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:37.600]   Is falling off the ball.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   Tom's probably right.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.600]   Nope, but there's no demand for this book.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.600]   No, I can't.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   I'm...
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   Why?
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.600]   Why are you...
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.600]   I used to work the history section at a bookstore in Austin, and the 20B stuff would always sell,
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.600]   but you had to mark it down.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:56.600]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens forget
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.600]   it.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   I'm killing you.
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   One of the twins.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   One of the twins.
