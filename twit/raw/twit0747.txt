[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.440]   We've got a great panel all in studio.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.040]   Lisa Schmeiser is here.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.400]   So is Alex Lindsey.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.080]   So is Ian Thompson.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.440]   We're going to-- Ian's really upset about the sale of the.org
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.000]   domain.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.400]   We'll talk about that.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.640]   Alex will explain why HDR is more important than 4K.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.960]   And Amazon's Echo is very, very disappointed.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.400]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.840]   I'm Twit.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.080]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.600]   From people you trust.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.200]   This is Twit.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:42.200]   This is Twit this week in Tech, episode 747.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.080]   Recorded Sunday, December 1, 2019.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.960]   Every click is a quote.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.600]   This week in Tech is brought to you by Eero.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.800]   Ever think about Wi-Fi again when you

[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.680]   And by Casper, a sleep brand that continues
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.040]   to revolutionize its line of products,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.880]   introducing the new Casper Hybrid mattresses,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.920]   featuring their award-winning foam layers now combined
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.960]   with springs.

[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.840]   And by LastPass, a personal password manager
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.000]   and identity solution for businesses all in one.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   You only need one master password and LastPass
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.800]   remembers the rest.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.400]   Is it LastPass.com/Twit to learn more.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.560]   And by Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.000]   Thinking about moving your data storage to the cloud,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600]   Wasabi is enterprise class cloud storage
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.280]   at 1/5 the price of Amazon S3 and up to six times faster
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.520]   with no hidden fees for egress or API requests.

[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.880]   Code Twits.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.800]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.280]   the show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.360]   I can't believe we have a full in-house panel today,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.600]   despite the atmospheric river dumping outside.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.240]   Ian Thompson, you like to come all the way up from San Francisco.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.040]   Thank you, Ian.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.400]   Ah, not a problem at all.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.200]   I appreciate it.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.800]   I want to say your freeway drivers just play all the tact
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.000]   and subtlety of a small nuclear weapon when he goes to the road.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.200]   Out of my way, Brit.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.600]   Ian writes for the register.co.uk,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.800]   as if you couldn't tell.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.400]   Actually, he doesn't write for him anymore.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.640]   Oh, no, I just still do stuff.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.080]   Oh, good.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.280]   I hope you do, because you're writing is fantastic.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.840]   Also, with us, she came from the East Bay today.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.040]   Lisa Schmeiser, editor at ITPro today.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   Hello, Lisa.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.960]   Hi.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.720]   I'm glad to be here.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.040]   How was the drive?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.120]   I left it very early.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120]   I don't think I'm going to have a chance
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.880]   to other people that have hard--
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.720]   And you got here very early.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.240]   I did.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.800]   Well, it was nice.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   I got to sit for an hour and catch up on the week's news
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.640]   in tech, because I haven't been paying attention for the last week.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.360]   I am blown away.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.120]   This is two weeks in a row.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.280]   We've had a panelist who prepared.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.920]   I don't know what to think of it.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.960]   Your audience deserves it.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.600]   And also, here, Alex Lindsey, who came off from far, far away.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   Go all the way from Nevada.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.440]   It's not Nevada.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.040]   It's not Nevada.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   It's just Nevada.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.160]   Nevada.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.760]   That would be funny if we call it Nevada.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   We should start a trend.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.400]   Because you know, Nevadaans will say, when you say Nevada,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.920]   they say, no, no, it's Nevada.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.440]   Nevada.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.120]   We should Nevada, which is a small town that the south of us
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120]   should start their trends.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.440]   No, no, it's Nevada.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.600]   See, how long it takes to propagate.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.800]   No, it's Nevada.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.000]   What do you talk about?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.680]   You mustn't be from around here.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.840]   It's Nevada.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.920]   It's just north of San Rafael.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.760]   Now, remember, Dr. Dunn used to say, San Rafael.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.520]   Like, oh, oh.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.720]   So you could call it San Raquel.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.480]   Anyway, yes, you survived the atmospheric river.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.760]   Last week, it was the bomb cyclone.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.400]   Oh, no.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.480]   Do we have-- is this unusual?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.760]   Is this a Californian thing?
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.080]   In the UK, do they have cute meteorological names?
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.240]   No, we just accept that it rains for about three months
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.160]   of the year.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.120]   I mean, it's just like--
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.720]   It's always going to be somewhat catchy,
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.800]   if we consider it to be longer.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.280]   But if you're talking continuous spread,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.040]   then November to February can be quite unpleasant.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.000]   But it's just--
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.640]   There's no special name for it, though.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.200]   It's winter.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.080]   Well, I mean, we have lots of names
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.600]   for rain.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.720]   There's pounding rain.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.440]   There's drizzle.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.240]   There's bizzle.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.280]   There's all kinds of different--
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.080]   We've had that for years.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.760]   It's like mosquitoes and snow.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.600]   We can describe it in a lot of different forms of rain.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.680]   But here, it's got to be something--
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.120]   If it bleeds, it leads.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.000]   It's got to be a bomb cyclone.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.920]   My theory-- and I don't know.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.520]   I'll stand corrected if I'm wrong--
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.120]   is that they all started when there was a 24-hour cable
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.680]   channel devoted to weather.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.360]   They just realized they can't say rain.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.640]   You've got to have some--
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.040]   You've got to have more time to talk about it.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   Exactly.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.240]   I've got the two or three minutes.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.520]   They have time and they are like, let's think of something better.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.640]   And you're trying to get headlines.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   You're trying to get viewers.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.880]   With Billy Collene on this, so why do we
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.160]   need weather forecasts at all?
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.440]   Just look out the window.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.760]   Well--
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.200]   So Noah actually, I think, coined the term atmospheric river.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.640]   There are--
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.120]   Noah?
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.160]   Notion National.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.800]   Oh, right.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   OK, right.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.080]   Actually, it would be appropriate.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.920]   I was thinking--
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.680]   I don't recall that passage in--
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.920]   You know, 40 days and 49.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.200]   We should make a boat because I think there's going to be a atmosphere.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   What's that?
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.400]   You're going to want to stock up on those animals?
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.200]   Tell the sun early.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.440]   They're going to have a long trip to get here.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.320]   I think setting a record for the earliest the show title
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.040]   has been pronounced.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.160]   We haven't even done any news.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.520]   No, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.440]   Atmospheric rivers are relatively long,
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.840]   narrow regions in the atmosphere,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.760]   like rivers in the sky that transport most
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.480]   of the water vapor out of the tropics
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.920]   and dump them on Petaloma.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.280]   Actually, the picture is of Bodega Bay, which is just over the road
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.360]   and over the hill.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.720]   Well, my wife is driving-- was it Thursday when this hit?
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.160]   And just like the up in Presidio, the roads
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   were just completely flooded because they got--
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.680]   you've got a summer's worth of leaves
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.280]   that have just dropped off the trees.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.920]   The drains were blocked out.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.000]   Atmospheric rivers, there are different kinds.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.560]   One of them, I think the one we're getting,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.200]   is the Pineapple Express.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.240]   Yes, it's much warmer than it was on--
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.720]   because on Thursday it was barely cracked 50.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.360]   And then yesterday it wouldn't begin dumping in the East Bay.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.880]   I was like, it's warm now.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.640]   Are you auditioning for the Weather Channel, Lisa Schmeister?
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.160]   And on Friday, warm Friday.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.200]   I always want to say, I don't remember any of this from school.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.720]   And I--
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.720]   No.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.080]   I think they made this all up recently.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   But on Wednesday it was--
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   High pressure, low pressure.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.480]   No, I went out-- we'd have to dinner on one
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.520]   to a friend's place with dinner on Wednesday.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.400]   And it went below single digit centigrade.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.760]   So we'll sign in Freedom Units.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.560]   It's about 50.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.040]   That's about 50.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.680]   And Californians are just like, oh, no, this is terrible.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.640]   I can't deal with it.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.160]   It's also put another layer on and just get on with it.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.240]   Have a cup of tea.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.520]   It got below freezing in the East Bay at the line this week.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.920]   It's been pretty cool.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.440]   It was the morning where we were.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.480]   There's one other theory.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.800]   It might not be the Weather Channel.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.720]   It's not the way it digits.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.880]   It might be the advent of Crazy Weatherman.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.760]   Remember there was a guy in San Francisco,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.800]   Lloyd Lindsay Young, he would use all sorts of strange implements
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.680]   to point like a toilet plunger.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.560]   And all sorts of weird stuff to point.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.040]   I'm so glad you said toilet plunger there,
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.680]   because this is San Francisco we're talking about.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.800]   It'd be all sorts of things.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.120]   Yeah, no, he never went that crazy.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.200]   I wonder if he coined it.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.440]   Maybe he did.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.600]   Anyway, that's not what we're here to discuss.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.680]   I just thought I'd start with something light, relaxing,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.800]   and calming.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.640]   Because Ian is going to blow his stack.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.480]   When we talk about the sale of .org.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.520]   I don't think this got widely reported,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.320]   but I think this is a very, very big deal.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.800]   We've covered it all week, because they
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.880]   sneak the announcement in late on Friday.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.200]   And you had a great interview with--
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   Oh, that's absolutely--
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.400]   Well, OK.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.880]   I'm sure he's a very skilled person in his own way,
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.160]   but it's just--
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.160]   So I think, first of all, what people probably don't know
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.800]   is how this works.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.000]   But there is something called ISOC.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.920]   Yes, the Internet Society.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.880]   The Internet Society is the owner of domain names.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.280]   They've been running-- well, they run a certain number
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.680]   of domain names, but because I can
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.840]   has been increasing the number of domain names out there,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.760]   then they've got some of the key ones.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.040]   So ISOCs in 2003 has been running .org.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.880]   It's been taken up by a lot of nonprofits.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.120]   Nominally, I always thought .org was restricted to nonprofits.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.800]   And if you saw .org, you could say with some certainty,
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.000]   oh, this is a nonprofit.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.200]   No, you see, this is what 99% of the rest of us
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.080]   assumed as well.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.600]   But once this story broke, the Internet Society
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.080]   has been actually known.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.560]   If you look at the paperwork, we never
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.880]   said it was explicitly for nonprofits.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.680]   No, in fact, I know people who have .org domain names,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.160]   and they're definitely nonprofit.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   Oh, shut non-profit.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.960]   Oh, I know why we buy them.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.880]   Did you buy them?
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.040]   When we buy--
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.080]   Schmeiser.org?
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.120]   I also have that in Schmeiser.com for a while.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.560]   I think for a family name .org is actually a good family.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.080]   We would routinely, when we get URLs,
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.240]   would routinely get .com.net.org.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.760]   You just get those three--
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.560]   You cut with it a lot of times.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.320]   We wouldn't register them unless we could see all three of them
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.720]   so that we knew that we had that group.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.680]   Nobody would steal it by saying pixelcore.org,
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.840]   and you'd think, oh, maybe--
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.560]   But all the different websites we put up all had--
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.400]   we always made sure we were able to get that set.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.480]   So .org was never really limited to it.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.160]   No, I'd promise.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.400]   Well, no, but it was--
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.600]   just for clarity.gov, you can't get .gov without being
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.200]   government, right?
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.960]   Or .mil or EDU.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.600]   Mil EDU, is that also pretty well-protected?
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.080]   Mil and EDU are both current.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.240]   But .org-- so that was mostly just conventional wisdom
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.160]   that it was nonprofits.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.680]   It wasn't.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.040]   Well, also because the pricing structure was set up
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.680]   in a way which appealed to nonprofits,
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.360]   and that you had fixed-term price caps,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.800]   you couldn't raise the domain costs more than 10% a year.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.600]   And that was built in right from the right start.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.720]   So it appealed an awful lot to nonprofits.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.600]   But also, you got that .org, which
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.640]   is a nice international organizational kind of approach.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.720]   So then, about six weeks ago, the internet society
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.960]   said, you know what?
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.760]   Maybe we should get rid of the price caps on this.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.320]   What do you guys think about this?
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.440]   And ask the users.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.520]   98% said no.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.120]   And then they thought, well, we've thought about it.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.680]   Yeah, we're going to take away price caps.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.840]   By the way, you know what the consequence of something
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.760]   like that is if you look at some of the prices of some
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.720]   of the weird domains, they can have thousands of dollars.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.720]   Even .tv is an expensive domain.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.240]   To voluteate that, you know, take that pound of flam.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.200]   So there is no set price for a domain.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.360]   Different TLDs, top-level domains,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.320]   can have different prices.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.800]   Yeah, OK.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.240]   Certainly.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.840]   And that price is set by the--
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.480]   not by the registrar, but by--
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.560]   By the domain host.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.800]   Or is it by the domain name host?
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.400]   It is by the domain name host, OK.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   So it could vary.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   You could shop around.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:08.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.560]   Absolutely.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.600]   But if you've actually built enormous amount of brand
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   into like amnacie.org or EFF.org or something like that,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.320]   I mean, it's OK if you're in the West.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.120]   But if you're a lot of African and a lot of Asian charities
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.800]   who got into this, if you drag their prices up 10%,
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.520]   that's going to seriously cut into their margins.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.080]   Right.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.920]   And it may not be just 10%.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.320]   Nope.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.600]   There's the sky's the limit.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.360]   Yeah, the sky is now the limit.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.480]   And they announced--
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.400]   Does ISAC-- is it a for-profit organization, the internet system?
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.200]   I don't think it's technically for--
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.400]   I mean, they are allowed to make a profit,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.120]   and they are supposed to give a certain amount to charity.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.320]   But they do make money.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.480]   And they've been increasing salaries quite readily.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.640]   But now they got it from Verisign in 2003, according
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.960]   to your article on the relationship.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.440]   And now apparently they are selling the org domain
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.880]   for a billion dollars.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.440]   That's kind of a coincidence.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:00.640]   To a price.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.160]   They raise the price caps.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.800]   And then a few weeks later sell it.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.240]   Sell it.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.600]   Maybe this was the plan.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.480]   As they reported in your publication,
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.240]   they say if we had consulted publicly about this sale,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.760]   the opportunity would have been lost.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.320]   So it's a nice first say.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   FCC would be that fourth rate.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   So if we ask you guys, we know you say no, so we just did it.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.160]   So it sounds like--
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.320]   Well, you got this private equity firm,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.000]   which didn't exist until a few months ago.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.680]   It's backed by three billionaire-owned private equity
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.640]   firms, including by Mitt Romney's firm.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.360]   And then--
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.240]   And then being capital.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.640]   And now they're looking to buy it for a billion.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.920]   Sorry for a billion.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.560]   And guess what they're going to do with it?
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.120]   They'll jack up the prices, pay themselves large management
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.080]   fees, and then run it for a profit.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.800]   And no one seems to be talking about this.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.440]   I mean, Tim Berners-Lee was on stage the day before we
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.520]   did a piece on this.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.960]   It was the number one question at the internet governance
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.360]   forum to put forward to Tim Berners-Lee to answer.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.200]   And they ducked the question entirely.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.160]   I mean, he put out a tweet a day later saying, actually,
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.240]   I stand with by Doc All.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.920]   But you were at the internet governance forum.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.840]   It might have been a chance there to say,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.120]   this is a really dumb idea.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.240]   It's just things to eye on.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.160]   I mean, one of the members of ICANN that I think is the COO,
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160]   is the leading member of this private equity firm.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.440]   They've got links to a former ICANN CEO as well.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.880]   It just thinks of a state shop.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.680]   He-- Sullivan, who did talk about it, to the register.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.800]   Yeah, kind of, yeah.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.520]   Well, but he wasn't really very--
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.480]   I thought he did a terrible job of representing himself.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.960]   Oh, no.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.400]   I mean, this guy--
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.920]   I think the only person who read that interview
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.400]   and thought that was really good was Prince Andrew.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.800]   He didn't rise to the Prince Andrew level, but it was close.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.560]   So for instance, was it Kiran who interviewed him?
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.960]   Yeah, Kiran's next bill on this.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.000]   Kiran McCarthy.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.480]   So he asks, what about the people?
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.720]   There are 10 million registrants.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.360]   What about the people who bought .org?
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.480]   Because it felt non-profit-y.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.200]   Exactly.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.880]   He said, well, Sullivan, it's 3 million
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.240]   who registered names prior to the transfer from Veracine in 2003.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.360]   The remaining 7 million--
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.560]   Only 70%.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.200]   70%.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.080]   Only a small portion would have taken that into consideration.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.960]   Most people just look for a domain name
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.880]   and get it through a company that's commercial.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.960]   Aha, really.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.640]   And yet, they're not actually releasing figures
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.320]   on how much of that percentage it's just--
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.560]   He even said a good number of .org registrants
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.160]   are domain name speculators.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.920]   So it's OK to take them for a ride.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.200]   Aha, right.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.560]   And if you're a charity-roaking in Sub-Saharan Africa
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.320]   to try and get clean water for your people,
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.840]   then just suck it up.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.280]   There's domain names caught us to punish.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.560]   So a billion dollars?
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.800]   That's rumored.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.640]   The actual figures haven't been released.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.840]   But yeah, they're--
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.920]   They talked about it.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.800]   The opportunity might not have been there.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.560]   Exactly.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.200]   Exactly.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   And it's like, who wouldn't want--
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.120]   I mean, this is why I don't get about them,
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.880]   why people aren't getting more out of ratio.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.160]   It's a domain name system.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.800]   It's not as though you've got to develop new products.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.520]   It's an admin, a legal, and some server time.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.280]   And it's a very low margin industry.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.120]   The only possible reason for removing price caps and selling
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.000]   off is to jack up the prices and make everyone else pay for it.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.800]   And make a billion dollars?
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.480]   This is the way vulture capitalism works.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.040]   It's sad that the internet society, which I--
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.040]   one thinks of as a--
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.040]   I know, you'd think--
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.560]   I know.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.760]   --public benefit corporation.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.600]   Absolutely.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.680]   I mean, they had a good reputation.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.520]   And then it's just gone like so much money under the--
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.320]   sorry, water under the--
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.680]   Sullivan said nothing short of a court order will stop this.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.160]   No, they've made up their minds.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.280]   This is his way of saying make us.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.760]   I mean, I can possibly, can technically stop it.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.400]   But there seems to be very little enthusiasm there.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.560]   Who runs I can these?
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.360]   See, I go back to the days when it was a guy at USC,
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.160]   John Postle, who just did the whole thing out of his office.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.800]   And I can eventually, the internet corporation for sign names
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.640]   and numbers became a little bit more--
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.640]   --professionally--
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.200]   --professional.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.040]   Well, I mean, technically professional.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   If you look at some of the amount of money they've spent,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.960]   the way they were sweat-walked into GDPR with the who
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.840]   is system whereby they would just say, well, who is this really
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.360]   important?
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.760]   We don't want to change the system.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.120]   GDPR's come in.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.200]   We'll negotiate an exit from this so we're not counted.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.160]   They took it to court four times.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   Each time the court said to them, no, you do have to obey your
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.040]   family or if you're operating in Europe.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.360]   The problem with who is being-- it publishes the--
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.280]   --registrants name and address and phone number publicly.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.600]   Exactly.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.200]   And that's why many of us pay extra-- actually, with hover,
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.080]   I don't have to pay extra, although I imagine it's built
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.960]   under the price--
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.720]   pay extra for who is privacy that uses an intermediary
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.560]   to hide or address.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.400]   And then people that really like who is a sort of digital
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.520]   rights law.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.600]   Well, I'm a hammer.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.560]   They call--
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.360]   Well, yes.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.440]   I was thinking legitimate businesses, but yes.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:17.480]   So for a while, the US Commerce Department kind of
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.320]   oversaw this.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.400]   But they gave it up a few years ago.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.880]   Then yes, it was like this is--
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.840]   So I'm thinking is this is better done as a private
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.640]   organization.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.200]   Is it non-governmental or is--
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.000]   Technically, yes.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.880]   All of the US has a fair amount of influence in it.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.160]   So with the dot org, I mean, currently, you can still get--
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.040]   I'm going to hover.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.600]   You can get a dot org for $12.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.840]   There's just no guarantee they won't raise the price.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.200]   There's no longer a cap on it.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.520]   But what do we think that-- what do we actually think
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.840]   would happen?
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.720]   And I'm just curious, like, how far--
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.480]   10% is going to be a couple dollars.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.720]   Would they double it?
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.280]   Or do they--
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.720]   Well, this is a year.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.640]   So I mean, I think if you're a Western nonprofit,
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.040]   it's not going to be a massive issue, because it'll just
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.200]   be a steadily increasing cost.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.160]   But because it's appealed to nonprofits
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.520]   so much around the world, as I say,
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.480]   if you're in Sub-Saharan Africa or Lower Southeast Asia,
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.400]   that constant jacking up of costs,
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.080]   you've got to make a choice.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.320]   Do we make the switch now to another domain, which
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.880]   might also face the same problem?
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.440]   Do we just suck it up?
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.640]   It just seems needlessly wasteful.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.160]   You know?
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.640]   It's like, yeah, a couple of private equity firms
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.040]   could make a profit out of this.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.920]   But it doesn't really give anything to the greater good.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.640]   And considering the number of nonprofits involved in this,
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.960]   it's kind of like, maybe we could just let this one pass
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.680]   and you can make your money in other ways.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.120]   Right.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.720]   It also just feels like making money off something
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.800]   like this is just inappropriate somehow.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.640]   It feels charities that can't help feelings.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.080]   Because even if it weren't ethically Dolgy.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.040]   Yeah, the last thing you want to see
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.400]   is a gold rush on internet domain names.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.680]   I mean, that's already started.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.000]   It's not good.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.040]   And it benefits to no one back then.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.880]   Well, OK.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.280]   As you pointed out, it's basically
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.480]   a lot of people making a lot of great whoopsie loads of money
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.320]   off of what is arguably a very limited resource that
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.080]   doesn't require a whole lot of maintenance
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.720]   or particular skill to operate.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.400]   And invites fraud.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.920]   I mean, Kieran, who wrote the stories,
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.080]   he wrote a book in the early 2000s called sex.com.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.520]   Oh, that was a great story.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.040]   Great story.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.760]   And this was-- this domain was making $20 million a month.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.680]   And months?
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.880]   And they just forged a signature, sent it to various sign.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.760]   And yeah, we'll reassign the domain to you.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.800]   And four years of legal arguments,
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.240]   the guy was on the run for two of them.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.920]   You know, I mean, this doesn't benefit the internet
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.000]   in any way, shape or form.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.080]   Domain names should be a simple cheat.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.200]   I mean, it's not so dramatic.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.160]   Costs involved.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.360]   So make it simple, cheap, and reliable.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.520]   And then we can get on with free market competition online.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.240]   There's plenty of places to make money on the internet.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.520]   I mean, that's the infrastructure level.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.800]   That's probably not a great idea.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.440]   All right.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.640]   Well, I thought we'd start with something
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.440]   that would get you esteemed up.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.400]   Hey, I didn't swear.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.320]   I was very careful.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:10.820]   Good.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.040]   I'm waiting for an e-inism of some kind, but nothing.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.800]   I--
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.960]   No, bollocks?
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.480]   Well, I could go with cockwombles to describe the guy.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.520]   No, cockwombles.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.320]   All right, now we have children in the world.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:26.880]   Oh, we do.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.960]   We have Alex's kids.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.640]   Oh, aren't you guys cute?
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.840]   Great to see you.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.200]   Our show today brought to you by--
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.840]   do you use an hero at home?
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.160]   I would if I were you with your lovely children.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.680]   I don't.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.840]   I'd like to.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.400]   I do.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.920]   I invested before they came out.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.160]   So, hero is mesh Wi-Fi.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.240]   It's Wi-Fi done right.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.960]   And we use it because one of the reasons I love it
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.640]   is I can say to my Amazon Echo, pause Michael's internet.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.200]   Oh, you.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.400]   No, it's a great part of the trick because I go, OK.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.080]   Everybody quiet.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.000]   Listen.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.320]   And I say, pause Michael's internet.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.360]   You wait a bit, and then--
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.120]   Daaaaa!
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.600]   It's great.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.280]   It's wonderful.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.280]   It's really fun.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:08.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.400]   It's the mean game to play.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.000]   No, but I have total control over the internet.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.920]   Incidentally, he can't go then Echo, unpause internet.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.040]   No, it doesn't work that way.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   He has to go on the pass.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.720]   You do watch speaking your time in home, right?
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.960]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.640]   I tell you what, these days Wi-Fi-- it's changed so much
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.720]   since it first came out.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.440]   And in fact, I think everybody's noticed Wi-Fi's gotten worse,
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:28.800]   right?
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.720]   And it's not really Wi-Fi's fault.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.440]   It's just that we're doing Netflix.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.520]   You got the kids in the bedroom watching YouTube.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.400]   You got your watch in Netflix.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.880]   Mom is streaming something else.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.320]   You've got dead spots.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.000]   You've got all-- and it's just complicated.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.480]   What you want is fast, reliable Wi-Fi that automatically
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.240]   shapes itself to your usage, doesn't buffer Netflix,
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   gives people the email they want when they want it
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.880]   without slowing anything else down.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.240]   And it's Eero, E-E-R-O. It sets up in minutes,
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.040]   plugs right into your cable modem or your DSL modem.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.160]   You can manage it through the Eero app,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.520]   which I am a big fan of.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.680]   In fact, I manage my mom's Wi-Fi too,
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   because when I got the new Eros, the version 2, which
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.080]   I use at home, I set the old ones.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.360]   My mom set them up for her.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.120]   So if she has trouble with her internet,
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.000]   I can literally go into the app and see what's going on,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.120]   see which of the-- actually, the other day,
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.480]   one of her units was down.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.280]   I called her up.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.240]   She said, yeah, I unplug it.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.040]   I said, well, plug it.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.560]   Plug it back in.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.000]   You can check usage.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.800]   You could check your bandwidth.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.160]   You could pause the Wi-Fi for any reason,
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.400]   whether it's dinner or bedtime or just because you want
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.040]   to mess with the kids.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.200]   You know one of the things I really love about it,
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.040]   I get an alert when a new device joins the network.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.880]   So when people come over, I can see
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.400]   that they've joined the network.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.320]   And if nobody has come over and we're just sitting there
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.120]   and says something's joined the network,
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.520]   that's a cause for concern.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.480]   That's where you can investigate
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.680]   and you can do it all in the Eero app.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.040]   It's great for guests too.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.320]   I have guest Wi-Fi and you can share it with them
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.520]   without compromising your own network.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.000]   And it expands to fit your needs.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.720]   If you're having a dead spot, you just go out
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.920]   and get another beacon, plug it into the wall.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.760]   And suddenly, you can stream work and play everywhere
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.080]   in every corner of your home.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.400]   Look, you don't want to be spending time
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.600]   thinking about Wi-Fi.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.400]   What you really don't want to hear is the--
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.680]   The Wi-Fi's down.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.400]   You don't have to think about it again.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.000]   Get Eero.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.320]   You can get fixed right away.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.400]   Like you can have it tomorrow.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.640]   If you go to Eero, E-E-R-O.com/twit
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.240]   and use a code to check out, you'll get free overnight shipping
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.840]   with your order.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.760]   Don't delay code at Eero today.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.360]   Eero.com/twit.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.400]   Use the offer code to get that free overnight shipping.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.360]   You're getting the Wi-Fi.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.080]   Every home deserves.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   You're getting Eero.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.120]   They really-- I think they were the first kind of consumer
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.000]   mesh.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.360]   And they've really lived up to their promise.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.920]   I have to say, they've done such a fantastic job.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.880]   And you can get rid of that Comcast modem that you have.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.160]   It'll still make you pay for it, though.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.880]   No, no, you sent it back.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.400]   No, you sent it back.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:05.900]   All right.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.400]   You can write it.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.640]   What I did, I bought it my own modem.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.480]   Went to the wire cutter.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.000]   They recommended, I think, a net gear.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.720]   I bought that.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.560]   They also recommend Eero.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.520]   And you set that up.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.800]   And yeah, you're not paying any rent to Comcast anymore.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.160]   You're not at their mercy anymore.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.440]   This was the strangest story.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.160]   I saw this today.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.640]   I don't know what you think of this one, Alex.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.800]   Johnny Ive removed from Apple's leadership page.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.880]   Didn't he leave ages ago?
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.720]   Why was he still on the leadership page?
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.960]   It's been a gradual exit, a gradual exit,
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.280]   where he may not have been that involved for a while.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.920]   And then they announced that-- they already
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.360]   announced, I think, a couple months ago
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.880]   that he was going to be a consultant for Apple,
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.680]   but not be part of the team.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.080]   And then they just took a little bit more time to finally--
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.040]   Slowly phase him out.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.160]   Yeah, look for a slow week and have it just--
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.920]   Is it unfair to blame Johnny for the butterfly keyboard?
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.320]   Is it pure coincidence that Apple
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.880]   released a decent keyboard the minute he was gone?
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.360]   Well--
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.440]   And by the way, a thicker iPhone with better battery life?
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.320]   Do you have anything that suggests this
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.160]   is anything more than a simple correlation?
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.400]   A lot of these are years in development.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.800]   So from the time we get the laptop,
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.320]   for the time it was designed, it was maybe oftentimes
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.040]   a couple of years.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.760]   So they may have decided a long time ago that the butterfly
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.640]   keys didn't work.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.360]   And it just took a while to get through the pipeline.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.000]   That's the wrong one thing.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.320]   Yeah, they're like admitted.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.160]   Because you have to design the key.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.200]   And then you have to design exactly how it's going to feel.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.800]   And then you have to design exactly how
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   you're going to manufacture it.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.160]   And then you have to test it 1,000.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.560]   You have those little things that just bang on it,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.160]   bang on the keys for literally all day, every day, for weeks.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.240]   And so there's all these things that
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:50.760]   have to happen.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   And those things take a long time to get through the pipeline.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.680]   So now it might have been the reason he left.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.360]   Who knows?
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.600]   And they're like maybe he's just upset about the keys.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.240]   But how dare you?
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.160]   We worked so hard on the butterfly key.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.040]   But my guess is those keys were probably corrected years ago.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.680]   And then they just took a while to get out of here.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.760]   Well, and it's taken a while to get them to the other laptops,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.120]   which they really need to do.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.680]   It was at this point.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.920]   Oh, I mean, the reputation of the keyboard was just too sad.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.960]   You're buying a new laptop.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.880]   You wouldn't even think about a Mac.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.520]   We call the Cupertino app idiot tax for a reason.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.840]   I mean, it's just like, why buy a laptop at 50% extra
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.520]   to the cost if it doesn't have 50% extra.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.040]   I have to say, I bought the new 16-inch
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.960]   because I, on the other hand, like Macs.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:37.480]   And priced it, compared it point by point as close as you can
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.880]   with a comparably equipped Lenovo.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.400]   The Lenovo was $4,000.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.200]   Mine was still expensive, but less than $4,000.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.000]   Interesting.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.560]   So I don't know how real that tax is anymore.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.360]   Well, honey, didn't they just produce a laptop,
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.280]   which was $6,000?
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.520]   No, you're talking about--
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.160]   You produced a monitor that was just--
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   Oh, that's what I'm going to say.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.440]   Yes, our monitor.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.080]   And from a professional perspective,
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.720]   that is actually a really good deal.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.200]   We pay a lot more for a monitor about accuracy.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.800]   The Mac Pro is $6,000.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.400]   And the monitor is $5,000, unless you want to stand
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.280]   than at $6,000.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:12.960]   Oh, of course.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.600]   Yes, $1,000 stand of course.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.320]   I think we're due.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.240]   They said the Mac Pro will be out in December.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.120]   This is now officially December 1.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.640]   So this is the month.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.120]   Coming this fall is really quite a stretch, Apple.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.360]   Still set set on the store.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.920]   Technically speaking, the winter solstice is December 21.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.000]   They have three more weeks.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.160]   Give a little more runway.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.720]   And it really does look like a cheese grater.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.440]   A really nice cheese grater.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.000]   You're going to buy one?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.600]   I'll wait.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.320]   It's really--
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.520]   So I have a thing about all computers,
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.920]   but I have to admit, especially Apple.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.120]   I love Apple, obviously.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.200]   It's a big Apple fan.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   But I don't buy the first version of anything.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.560]   So I will wait until they--
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.000]   At least you can wait till version 2,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.520]   if you're buying Microsoft, you go to wait till version 3.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.040]   Right.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.640]   So I like to let everything sort itself out.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.760]   There's always some weird little glue that wasn't quite right
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.920]   or some part of the process that gets itself worked out.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.760]   And I prefer to wait.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.480]   I paid the price by ordering the Mac Pro.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.440]   Trash can.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.080]   Trash can right out of the gate.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.800]   And there's just all these RAM issues.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.640]   I had, I think, two units before I got one that sort of worked.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.440]   This is pretty, I guess.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.920]   It's weird looking.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.240]   That's a Johnny I've-- I'm pretty sure that's a Johnny I've
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:27.840]   designed.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.400]   Geez, greater.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.440]   I mean, those holes.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.800]   It honestly looks like something you'd pick up
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.240]   as part of the Target Michael Graves line.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   Well--
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   It does.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   It does.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   It does.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   What does Michael Graves specialize in?
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   Clothing implements?
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   No, he was--
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.960]   I believe-- and I could be wrong about this.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.720]   Or I could Google this while I'm talking and make it sound
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   like I know what I'm talking about.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   That's what I do.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   I highly recommend it.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.840]   And I work fast, though.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.760]   He was one of the first designers that Target
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.080]   worked with architecture.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080]   He was one of the first designers--
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.640]   Oh, it's an architect.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.440]   The reason I know his name and the reason it's stuck around
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.400]   is he was one of the first brand name type designers
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.400]   Target began working with back in the Audis when they started
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.280]   rolling out their quote unquote "astage" lines.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.280]   Oh, there you go.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   Oh, I recognize these.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.560]   Carson's showing some of his kitchen appliances.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.200]   Very distinctive that toaster.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.840]   I've seen that toaster.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.880]   And he did a line of kitchen tools for Target, too.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.600]   And to be honest, that computer reminds me--
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.600]   Could be his--
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.600]   I don't know if the cheese grater--
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.840]   I mean, the biggest--
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.960]   A lot of us sat around in our office
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.520]   talking about when we thought--
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.040]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.520]   What's going to happen?
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.040]   There's the cheese grater.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.480]   There it is.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.480]   It looks just like a Mac Pro, really.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.200]   Let's recontextualize it.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   That cheese grater looks like the Mac Pro.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.000]   Of course, it came out 10 years earlier.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.800]   Well, so what has Joni and I have been doing?
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.280]   I ask you.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.960]   I wonder how much the wheels on that cheese grater cost.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.480]   They haven't announced the price for the wheels on the Mac Pro
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:46.840]   yet.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.000]   We're still waiting for that shoot.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.320]   I think that a lot of us--
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.200]   we were sitting around our office at one point talking
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.800]   about when the new Mac Pro comes out.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.920]   When they started to become rumors,
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.080]   that there was going to be a new one,
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.520]   and they were going to redesign it.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.040]   And our big thing was is that we wanted it
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.760]   to be able to remove the feet and the head.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.120]   That's what our complaint was.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.360]   We loved the cheese grater, except what we didn't love
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.560]   was the fact that we couldn't rack mount it
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.560]   and that we couldn't remove the handles and the feet.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.960]   They were part of the design.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.600]   And we were just like, we just really want that.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.080]   And you couldn't-- it's really painful to pick up
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.640]   a cheese grater and carry it around
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.600]   because of the way the metal is.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.320]   So it really felt like when they announced this,
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.320]   that they kind of sorted out what most of us--
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.120]   are pros that are using these heavy duty.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.360]   We wanted it to be extensible.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.520]   We wanted to be able to swap cards.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.560]   We wanted to be able to add cards.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.880]   We wanted to be able to do all the things
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.520]   that we couldn't do with the trash can.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520]   And--
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.120]   It looks like you can with this.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.280]   And a lot of us all said, we don't
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.840]   need it to be any different than the cheese grater.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.600]   Just slightly.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.280]   Just tune it up a little bit.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.880]   And we're good.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.840]   We have different needs than a lot of other people.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.360]   For three years, I've been saying,
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.560]   Apple, why are you worried about designing a new Mac?
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.280]   Just, were you released the cheese grater?
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:53.960]   You've got a great--
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.200]   Well, and this one takes it a lot further.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.000]   I mean, it can--
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.560]   It's a better sensibility.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.120]   The extensibility of this computer.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.160]   Because there are people that I work with--
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.600]   These are all modules that we could pull out the modules.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.640]   That will spend 50 grand on upgrading this thing.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.280]   And what we want is what I thought
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.760]   is that within the next couple of years,
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.240]   I was going to have to move all my production to PCs
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.280]   because I wasn't going to have anything
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.840]   that I could extend.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.880]   The only-- my biggest complaint about the new Mac Pro
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.800]   is that we don't have Nvidia cards.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.200]   And we won't now.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.800]   Well, Nvidia has decided not to do that.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   We're never going to do that.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.440]   They're not doing it anymore.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:28.960]   They give up.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.440]   This is a control issue where Nvidia wants to write the drivers.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.000]   Apple wants to write the drivers.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.520]   The problem is that the OS relies so much on OpenGL or metal
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.640]   or that they can't--
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.320]   Apple is not going to give up control of the raw code
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.200]   to the card.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.560]   And Nvidia won't give up the control.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.880]   And it's been that way for, I don't know, a decade now.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:57.440]   And the problem is that the way that ATI--
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.520]   it's not AT anymore, it's AMD.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.280]   Someone keeps on correcting me when I say that on shows.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.480]   AMD former.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.880]   I called ATI because the AM--
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.560]   I think that the ATI graphics--
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.920]   or the AMD graphics cards stink.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.840]   And the AMD CPUs are great.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.560]   I have a Threadripper at home.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.120]   I love the CPUs.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.840]   So I feel like their CPU unit done well.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.640]   And it really comes down to how they approach the way
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.560]   that they manage the data coming through.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.740]   So the ATI, what used to be ATI, the AMD card
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.960]   breaks it into very small little pieces that accelerate it.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.240]   And that process from a professional graphics
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.720]   perspective is really painful compared to Nvidia.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.280]   And so your performance for heavy graphics solutions
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.920]   tends to be better on an Nvidia and more stable than AMD.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.520]   At least that's--
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.400]   So as we wrote it, that was what we're up to.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.640]   Nvidia has confirmed in the latest release notes
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.320]   that the CUDA Toolkit version 10.2 will be the last one
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.720]   to support Apple's Mac OS.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.920]   CUDA is Nvidia's low-level GPU control language, right?
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.080]   OpenCL was--
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.640]   And I don't think Apple really cares.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.480]   Apple has metal as metal equivalent.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:12.000]   They've been suing each other.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.160]   It's a shame, because at least until recently,
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.320]   you could buy an eGPU and put Nvidia cards in it
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.800]   and it would work, right?
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.840]   Now is it just not going to work at all?
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.200]   We haven't even tried for a long time.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.120]   It was always a kind of a wonky solution if you--
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:33.480]   So no more CUDA in the Mac, Wuda, sort of.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.920]   OK.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.240]   And then everybody in the--
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:43.600]   One of the big stories of Black Friday was the rise in the AMD
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.640]   parts flying off the shelves for people
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.920]   who build their own computers.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.880]   This is suddenly people are looking at AMD and saying,
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.240]   it used to be you'd say, well, I'm
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.960]   going to save a lot of money, and I'm
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.680]   going to give up 15% performance.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.240]   Now I'm going to save a lot of money over Intel,
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.000]   and I'm going to get 15% better per person.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.440]   I have in the computer that I built.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.080]   I have a thread ripper that is in the last generation,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.880]   and it just screams.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   I'm going to hit it for multi-core processes, right?
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.120]   That's really what you want.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.000]   Who is seeing this with Ryzen and also with Epic?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.960]   AMD has really sort of come back because Intel's
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.200]   been mired in these production problems.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.720]   They've been spending so much time trying
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.200]   to get to 10 nanometer.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.040]   And failing.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.680]   And you know, reducing production on the 14 nanometer.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.360]   And then we're going to just go and stand up thing.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.800]   That's up the margins a bit.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.720]   We'll get a bit of a percussion.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.960]   They're still warning OEMs.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.720]   We can't provide you with an 14 nanometer cheers.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.120]   This is an ideal time for AMD to swoop in and say, well,
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.640]   guess what?
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.840]   We've got them.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.720]   You know?
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.160]   AMD doesn't have yet a portable solution because the power
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.120]   uses the TPU on these hundreds of watts.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.360]   I mean, these are non--
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.400]   There's a light bulb in your computer.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   They have confirmed that they will have a 64 core thread
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.920]   ripper next year.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.680]   It'll be $2,000.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.800]   But I bet you're going to get a little bit more
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.600]   that will be $2,000.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.400]   I bet you can fly bacon off it.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.120]   And it probably is 250 watts at least.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.600]   So I can't wait.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.040]   Well, no.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:12.800]   I mean, it's just--
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.640]   In some of it's been taking the mic--
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.040]   So you can make it with this on--
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.200]   I guess the problem--
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.000]   you know, you're going to get-- you can get a 28 core Mac
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.120]   Pro, but you might want a 64 core something else.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.640]   So for--
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.440]   It just really depends on what I'm doing.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:31.600]   So the main thing that I do on my PC is photogrammetry.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.000]   And so I'm throwing--
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.480]   What's photogrammetry?
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.200]   So photogrammetry is you take photos of a location
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.800]   or of an object from multiple angles.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.160]   And then you allow the computer to basically figure out--
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.520]   create a 3D model from those photographs.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.080]   So it triangulates the position of the cameras,
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.600]   then builds depth maps and generates geometry.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.920]   And for instance, the data set that I'm working on right now
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.880]   has 493 million polygons.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.680]   And you can't run it on a Mac or at the moment.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.560]   You can't move it around.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   You can't do anything with it.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.280]   You're like, you move it, then you're going to do something else.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:09.960]   And that's an Intel issue.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.120]   That's because it's running on its own.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.120]   It's the graphics.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.720]   It's just too heavy for what I have.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.360]   And so--
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.200]   And then you get into--
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.600]   I can't even decimate that to a reasonable number
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.720]   of polygons without 256 megs of RAM.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.920]   I just run on RAM.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.960]   And so it is a--
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.400]   So those become issues that you need these heavy lifts.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.840]   Now, the other side of it is I still use motion and final cut
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.400]   and logic and all those things.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.040]   And some of those are already--
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.000]   as we move towards an 8K world--
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.440]   and I'm already editing on 6K--
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.080]   that I need that processing power.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.680]   I needed to be able to throw all that stuff in,
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.080]   do color corrections, do all the effects that I wanted.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.320]   So then why Apple built the Mac Pro specifically for you?
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.520]   Well, and I think that I think about the new Mac Pro.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.120]   I don't know specifically for me.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.320]   But for people like me, absolutely.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.640]   And I think that the Mac Pro is going
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.880]   to be incredible for sound designers and video editors
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.840]   that are using final cut.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.360]   And people are doing 3D.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.680]   I mean, the Cinema 4D in my work has been--
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.120]   This really underscores, though.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.560]   Apple has been hindered by their dependence
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:26.480]   on Intel for the last five, six, 10 years for a long time.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.440]   And Apple has really kind of bristled.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.480]   And so much so that everybody agrees,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.920]   and Apple's sort of telegraphing, they're probably
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.400]   going to move off of Intel at some point.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.520]   There's no way, though, that they can do what the Mac Pro is
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.760]   doing on a arm.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.920]   No, not yet.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.000]   I mean, another decade, maybe.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.760]   I read an article, probably in Forbes,
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.240]   where you read articles of this kind, that said, oh, it's
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.600]   clear Apple's going to AMD.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.960]   Otherwise, why would they be doing catalysts and pushing it
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.480]   so hard?
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.520]   That's the technology that lets Apple iOS developers
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.840]   port their apps easily to Mac OS.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.680]   I don't think that's the same issue.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.080]   Well, but then the problem when you move to ARM
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.520]   is either you're going to have emulation, which Windows does,
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.120]   and it's terrible and slow.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:09.600]   Or--
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.920]   Let's don't forget Windows RT from a few years ago,
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.240]   as well, which was--
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:18.360]   But even Windows on ARM now on a high-end Qualcomm/Microsoft
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.960]   chip is still stuck in 32-bit and it runs in emulation.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.720]   It's not great.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.960]   Or you could somehow create a whole new code base of ARM
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.640]   software.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.560]   So I imagine there's somebody writing logic and final cut
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.280]   in Apple on the spaceship campuses,
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.720]   rewriting that for ARM, right?
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.480]   I have no idea.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.680]   But I think that the--
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.440]   I think we could see the light, the MacBooks.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.480]   You're not the MacBooks.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.480]   That's the first to go for sure.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.440]   The MacBooks, I think, I could see them going to ARM.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.760]   And I could see-- and maybe they don't run all those things.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.960]   But it's a big lift to take the code base for something
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.880]   like final cut or logic and move it from one place
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.400]   to the other.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.680]   And so I think that that's going to--
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.960]   I have no idea how long that will take to--
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.600]   So we're a ways off.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.200]   And I think that it'll take a long time
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:11.360]   to reproduce what AMD or Intel is doing is from a sheer lift.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.960]   Called the radio show and said, do I
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.480]   have to get the XDR monitor?
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.760]   I want to get the Mac Pro.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.400]   It depends on what you're doing.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.040]   If you're doing some--
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.600]   Well, I told them.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.160]   Color sensitive, yes, absolutely.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.360]   You're doing color correction, and you
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.360]   would be buying a $30,000 professional monitor for that.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.200]   Or $12,000 or $8,000 monitor.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.600]   I mean, they're in that range.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.240]   $5,000 or $6,000 for a color accurate monitor that is a--
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.440]   that's some version, some flavor of HDR is par for the choice.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.800]   HDR is the key, huh?
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.720]   I mean, it's not-- it's a very accurate monitor.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.080]   Do you get a color accurate monitor now for a map,
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.040]   or a food--
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.880]   Well, at that size--
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.080]   What is the average in a build range?
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.120]   Yeah, fine, whatever they call the LG monitor.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.640]   Yeah, I know.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.480]   $5K monitor.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.360]   That's pretty accurate.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.480]   I would imagine Apple's been selling it until now.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.080]   Right, right.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.920]   Yeah, it is.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.440]   But getting to be both HDR and that right,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.880]   for that long period of time.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.720]   So a lot of them will say, well, we're--
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.200]   you want to look at what the peak values are,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.320]   as well as the constant values of how
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.240]   many nits the monitors are.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.080]   And I believe-- I can't remember exactly,
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.320]   but I believe that the new monitor is near 1,000 nits
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.560]   constant.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.040]   And I think that it's 1,600--
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.880]   That's bright.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.640]   I believe.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.320]   I don't have that right in front of me.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.280]   But those were--
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.480]   Sunglasses when you were--
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.440]   The brightest I've seen is 4,000 nits.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.280]   And that is--
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.120]   I mean, you feel like you should be feeling it.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.120]   Like, when you see sunlight--
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:40.800]   It hurts.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.760]   It doesn't hurt.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.240]   It's just that it's so bright.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.280]   And it's not just--
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.600]   As you want, if you're JJ Abrams,
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.880]   you want those specular highlights
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.240]   to almost burn your redness.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.960]   So you look at the brightness, and you almost expect
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.480]   to feel heat--
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.720]   You almost expect to feel heat from it at four thousand--
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.960]   Just in the middle of the sun glasses on.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.920]   Well, and the big thing is also with these monitors--
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.120]   We have mountains to prevent space
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.960]   that snow blindness doesn't--
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.240]   The other side of it is also the big thing
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.280]   is that the pixels can go all the way to zero.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.960]   So that means that you get these super dark blacks
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.520]   that you don't typically see on your monitor.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.680]   That's the HDR.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.920]   Well, HDR is the high dynamic range.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.440]   So we're talking about--
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.360]   I mean, the pure HDR is not pure,
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.840]   but the production HDR we call PQ 2020.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:31.320]   And that is the new format that is going to describe
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.080]   a much wider range of brightnesses.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.600]   Brighter brights and darker dark.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.240]   So why do you need to see brighter brights and darker darks?
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.160]   Because that's how life looks.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.760]   No, I'm just trying to extrapolate
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:47.920]   out the business applications or the industry applications
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.560]   or why this isn't that benefit to some industry
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.840]   or some end user.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.000]   It turns out that most of us will
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.680]   notice the quality of the image more readily
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.360]   if we look at the dynamic range than if we look at resolution.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.560]   If we have a 4K image and a 1080p image,
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.240]   a lot of people can't tell the difference between that,
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.240]   whereas a lot of--
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.920]   Especially at some distance.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.240]   But a lot of people will see the difference in the monitor.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   And when you--
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:12.760]   And when you--
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.400]   HDR means much more to me in a monitor than 4K.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.320]   And especially in-- where it makes a difference is not,
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.160]   for instance, in a studio like this, that has been lit for SDR.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.560]   You know, this is--
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.400]   We've compressed--
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   Everything's bright.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.280]   Everything's bright.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.400]   Well, it's designed for it, though.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.000]   It's designed for that range.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.760]   But when you go into HDR-- so SDR, I believe,
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.160]   is in the--
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   I never remember the exact number, but it's about four or five
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.240]   stops of light.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.000]   Each stop is twice as much light as the last one.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.280]   Whereas HDR is in the 15 to 18 stops of light.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.720]   So it's-- I remember each stop is twice as much as the last one.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.200]   So it's a huge range of brightnesses.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:57.240]   And we can't describe-- if you shoot in SDR,
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.240]   we can't describe an outside scene with where the sun's out.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.960]   It'll immediately-- one part's too dark,
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.440]   and the other part's too bright.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.960]   It's out of the gamut of SDR.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.840]   Whereas an HDR is within a narrow range of brightness.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.080]   So it's basically a technological leap,
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.640]   like the one that was taken from, say, filming night time
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.400]   scenes with a blue lens in the 1960s
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.200]   to actually be able to film at night.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:19.840]   To some degree.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.360]   To some degree.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.080]   This is another visual leap like that,
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   where you'll have a technology that allows you to more accurately
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.520]   convey degrees and shading of light.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.400]   It's definitely getting-- like, I saw--
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.880]   I was at NAB, and they were showing--
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.520]   Sony had a big LED wall, and they
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:40.320]   were showing 120 frame per second 8K HDR.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.480]   And when I got to a point where it filled my periphery,
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.800]   when they moved the camera, my stomach
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.800]   would pull in because my brain could no longer tell
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.320]   that it was not looking to ruin.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.160]   Like, it was--
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.880]   It can no longer detect that you're looking at an image.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.680]   You're no longer looking at a monitor.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.440]   At this point, what's happened is that monitor is a ability
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.800]   to reproduce what we can perceive is now--
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.240]   Well, and that's really what you're going for, right?
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:10.640]   And the issue is that the big question that we have in our industry
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.880]   right now, the word there's a lot of discussion about,
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.520]   is do you want to go to that point?
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.880]   Because you get into this uncanny valley that part of what--
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.000]   If you don't want people getting sick in the theater,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.360]   because it looks like you're moving them without--
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.520]   Or you know, there's a lot of people who say that the 24
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.520]   frame per second is a subconscious way to tell the brain--
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.040]   It's fake.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:31.440]   This is fake.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:31.880]   It's not real.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.720]   Remember this is fake.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.520]   Whereas--
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.200]   Honestly, I don't like high frame rate for that very reason.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.480]   It's too real.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.280]   I want that dreamy movie.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   I think for narrative, I think what we may see is a split,
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:42.640]   where we have--
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.320]   Documentary--
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.320]   Narrative.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.760]   You know, goes down, stays in the 23.9.8.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.880]   Yeah, because it's dreamy.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.360]   Documentary, when you're shooting eight--
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.080]   Because I will tell you that at 8K, 120 frame per second,
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:55.840]   wildlife--
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.680]   It's very realistic.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.640]   It's stunning.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.400]   It is stunning.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.840]   You know, and it's just this amazing experience.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.480]   It's a looking cat had button in the screen.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.320]   And I don't want to see Gandalf's staff at 8K.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.440]   Because it looks like it's made out of resin.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.240]   Gandalf's staff.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.680]   I'm thinking about augmented reality, for example.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.040]   Well, we're way-- we're barely--
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.080]   Well, I mean, you can see the screen door nowadays.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.080]   I'm thinking of stitches from your eyes.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.560]   No, but what I'm thinking, for example,
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.720]   is one of the things I've noticed with augmented reality
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.320]   is it's augmented only in this.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.280]   It's not real.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.400]   You mean, you go, oh, wow, I'm looking at the shop dance.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.840]   I think you wanted that way.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.480]   But if you're using augmented reality on, say, a space station,
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.720]   or down in Antarctica to walk somebody
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.680]   through removing a tumor while there's
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.720]   snowed in for five months, this is when visual acuity
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.880]   is going to matter.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.160]   And so what I'm trying to think about now is--
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.640]   or what I'm-- and you know many things,
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.400]   so you may be the one to answer this question.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.520]   How long until this gets to a point where it's not just
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.320]   for filming an industry use, but it moves into--
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.120]   Oh, it's already there.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:02.680]   Consuming.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.200]   Consuming.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:03.880]   And it's being used.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.440]   So when you look at industry, Microsoft
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.920]   is actually one of the furthest along when it comes to the AR
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.120]   stuff with the HoloLens.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:10.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.520]   And so what they're doing is probably the furthest along.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.600]   They were so smart to team up with NASA,
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.880]   because that gave them just a bunch of great tests.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.760]   When I tried out the first HoloLens demo machine
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.360]   on the Curiosity thing, I gave a very
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:32.000]   exciting interview to Megan and did swear a certain amount
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.480]   in that, but it just blew you away.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.320]   Well, and sometimes you have to swear.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.320]   I think that they learn from Google what not to do,
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.000]   which is let average people just wander around with the stuff
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.360]   on and do things that were inappropriate.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.760]   And so whereas they-- by keeping it inside the industry,
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.200]   they were able to-- and I've done some great stuff
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.840]   in construction, for instance, where
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.240]   you can walk onto a construction site
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.840]   and visualize all the things that are out there in front of you
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.960]   before they're built and have a discussion about it.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.360]   And so--
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.680]   One of the demos I got to do with the HoloLens
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.960]   was precisely that where we walked onto a construction site.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.520]   You got to see how parts got--
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.920]   you got to see how to build things
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.520]   within the constraints of regulations
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.640]   and with the constraints of where the electrical outlets
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:17.000]   have to go, where the ventilation shafts have to go,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:17.720]   things like that.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.360]   And I also really liked another one of the demos I did,
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.120]   had you taking a look and trying to repair plumbing
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.240]   infrastructure, not knowing how, and then
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.120]   being able to call the manual in your left-hand periphery
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.600]   and a live expert in your right.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.560]   That's the one I like.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.080]   And that was the one that blew me away.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.680]   It was the idea.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.720]   In Circle and Stacy, this joint turned this--
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.000]   And they see what-- and they're following your online.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.960]   But that was an also an error I thought, wow,
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.800]   we're going to get to a point where you're going to need
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   to be able to see really well in order to--
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.760]   Well, and one of the tests--
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.800]   I think to repair something.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.680]   One of the tests that we did was with Hangout
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.600]   before Google turned Hangouts off on--
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.080]   the only thing that we liked using the Glass 4
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.880]   was the Hangouts feature.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.200]   And then Google turned it off.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.840]   But what we did is we could have a camera, the same camera,
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.000]   on either side of thousands of miles apart.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   And I have the camera.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.680]   They have the camera.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.720]   I'm seeing what you're seeing.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.880]   You're seeing what I'm seeing.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.120]   And you have someone trying to learn how to use the camera.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.560]   And I'm going, no, no, no, don't touch that button.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.760]   Touch this button.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.240]   And your ability to very quickly have a conversation
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:17.760]   about that.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.640]   And that was just with Glass.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.560]   And that was five years ago.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.480]   I mean, it's not even new stuff.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.640]   But I think that there's a--
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.600]   from a learning perspective, from an experiential perspective,
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.920]   there's going to be a huge explosion.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.600]   But it's still--
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.520]   It definitely goes through this with video games
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.960]   where they went from hyper unrealistic to more and more
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.440]   realistic.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.040]   But we seems like we hit a brick wall where--
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.320]   and it may be C.E.N. County Valley,
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.680]   but we can't get--
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.440]   I mean, video games today are pretty realistic.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.320]   But you would never mistake it for reality.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.680]   Are we still making that progress?
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.000]   Or did it just slow down?
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.280]   Or have we hit a wall?
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.960]   Some of it has to do with the lowest--
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.240]   you're still building video games for the lowest
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.040]   common denominator.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.560]   So if I put a--
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.920]   If you knew everybody's using a Mac Pro--
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.320]   If I knew that everyone was using a really powerful PC
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.120]   with four top of the line GPUs, and I have seen solutions
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:13.680]   that use those--
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.440]   Ray Tracing and City of Ray Tracing GPUs.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.280]   The Ray Tracing is not as important as the global
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:17.840]   illumination.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.160]   So being able to calculate shadows in soft light
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.040]   is actually-- the Ray Tracing is cute.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.400]   I mean, I'm glad that they're doing it.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.280]   But I don't--
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.240]   I rendered 50 shots for Star Wars without any Ray Tracing
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.360]   with a shiny ship.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.560]   So it doesn't--
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.000]   But you didn't do it in real time.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.200]   No, I didn't do it in real time.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.000]   But I'm saying I didn't need Ray Tracing either.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.360]   To pull it off, you use reflection maps and stuff like that.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.200]   And so it's not--
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   You don't need--
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.040]   The Ray Tracing is useful for things.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   But I'm more interested in the global illumination.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.280]   Global illumination.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.520]   That's calculating.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.040]   If you think of light as like a heat,
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.640]   it hits something, heats that up,
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.680]   and then it bounces off.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.440]   So it's all the indirect light that we have
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.160]   that really makes things look--
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.320]   That sounds like Ray Tracing.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.920]   And then that way you're doing is bouncing.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.160]   Well, that's Ray Tracing is coming from the point
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.800]   of the light bouncing around and then getting to the--
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.240]   this is-- but it's just reflecting in a way
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.560]   that global illumination is really area of light.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:17.040]   But the big thing is being able to add--
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.640]   so part of the problem that we have right now
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.160]   is we can't add enough geometry.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.400]   So even now I've been doing a bunch of AR tests
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.040]   with Apple's reality composer.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.440]   About a million and a half polygons.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.040]   That's what I can put into an iPhone, last generation iPhone.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.520]   And so I don't--
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.680]   Like that's about as far--
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.680]   There's a video game doing these days.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.760]   Oh, they do more than that?
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.800]   They do more than that.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.000]   But I don't know exactly what the numbers are.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.520]   It depends on how they chop it up and everything else.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.200]   But the point is that we need to get to a point
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.360]   where we're processing 50 to 100 million polygons.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.200]   We're processing gigs of texture maps.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.800]   And of course, some of that is managed
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.960]   by using what we call a level of detail.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.360]   So LODs where you change the resolution based
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.240]   on the distance to the camera.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.320]   But those are-- you still need to have that.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.000]   That's what's not making it look real that.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.360]   And motion capture.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.960]   Motion capture is kind of-- it got us 90% there.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.320]   But we have to get to a point where
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.960]   the characters are--
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.320]   AI is driving the character motion.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.280]   And it's not being--
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.720]   Have to move as opposed to how you get services.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.200]   They just move the way they should.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.920]   It's not-- it's not like--
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   Because right now, most of--
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.080]   We're still simulating instead of--
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.600]   Most of our games are-- yeah, most of our games are--
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.720]   I have a run move.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.760]   I have this move.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.080]   And I might blend between those.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.320]   But those are still human moves.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.640]   What we're not doing yet is having the computer go.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:34.760]   I have a range of motion.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.560]   And I'm just going to figure out what I should be doing.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.400]   This follows a general law of computing,
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.600]   which is that the first 90% are doable, relatively easy.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.280]   The last 10% is much, much harder.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:45.880]   Right, right.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.800]   Well, how often does a character in a video game
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.680]   have a startle reflex?
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.560]   Right.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.080]   And you need that.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.280]   When that thing hits your face and sucks the brains out of you,
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.240]   you got to be startled.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.760]   Or it's just not realistic.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.320]   Boy, I had a lot more questions like,
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.600]   why do you think Intel stumbled?
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.640]   But I got to take a break.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.040]   I'll let you guys think about that.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:10.720]   And I also want to talk about Apple giving Crimea to Russia.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.280]   It was very nice of them.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.200]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.920]   Our show today brought you by my beautiful mattress.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.240]   You know, sometimes you look around at the world
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:25.840]   and you get home and you're your sanctum sanctorum.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.200]   Your special place is that bed in your bedroom
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.840]   and you get in bed and you pull the covers up over your head.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.960]   And you want it to be perfect.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.640]   You want it to feel great.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.840]   You want to spend the night there and not worry about the world.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:45.760]   Just sleep the way a baby sleeps.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.400]   That's why you need a Casper mattress.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.200]   It's a sleep brand that is created.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.360]   They're an online only retailer, premium mattresses.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.280]   And that's key online only because they eliminate the middleman
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.320]   so they can make beautiful, fantastic mattresses
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.760]   without that big markup, like the 100% markup
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.120]   that the mattress store makes.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.440]   Now there's an outside of that because I think a lot of people
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.520]   for a long time thought, well, I have to go to the mattress store
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.800]   and sleep on the mattress or lie on it anyway for five minutes.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:16.760]   If I want to buy it, so Casper had to solve that.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.720]   And they took that engineering approach to that problem too.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.280]   They put their great minds to it and they said, oh,
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.440]   what if we let you have it for 100 days?
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.560]   And if any time of the 100 days is not perfect,
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.080]   you send it back, we give you every penny back.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.840]   How about that?
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.520]   That's the key.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.080]   And mattresses are just the beginning of Casper.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.840]   Their engineering talent has now created that low light.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.240]   I love that low light.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.200]   Helps you fall asleep at dims.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.120]   It slowly wakes you up.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.200]   You could pick it up and carry it to the bathroom with you
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.960]   and it's nice and low once you wake you up.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.000]   They also have bed frames now.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.400]   Everything you need to create, that special place you go to,
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.560]   to run away from the rest of the world.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.480]   Casper just introduced a new hybrid mattress collection.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.920]   I just got the hybrid mattress.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:06.640]   It combines the pressure relief of their original award-winning
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.920]   foam, but they've done some-- you know, it's funny.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.040]   It's a little-- at first, you know, they said, no springs,
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.800]   no springs.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.160]   But they realized there's a certain reason
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.160]   you might want springs.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.960]   And so this hybrid mattress collection has the foam,
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:22.080]   but also durable and very gentle springs.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.040]   And actually, I prefer it.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:23.800]   I love it.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.040]   You've got to try it.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.080]   It offers luxurious comfort, resilient support, elevated lift.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.040]   So it's a little more active in its support.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.360]   It also is more durable for all body types.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.760]   The spring network actually enhances air flow.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.760]   It's always been good on a Casper mattress.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.880]   It is even better now.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.840]   So it really helps you sleep cool, very important to sleep.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.400]   And for a man of a certain girth like myself,
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.360]   the other thing the spring does, it
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.920]   gives you edge support, a little bit better edge support.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.040]   So I used to roll out of bed in the morning, literally.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.280]   Roll out of bed.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.760]   Now, with the springs, I could sit up and get out of bed
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.160]   like a normal human.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.360]   There's my Casper hybrid mattress.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.440]   I just got it.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.400]   Like all the Casper mattresses, I still
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.240]   don't know how they do this.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.720]   They come in a surprisingly compact box.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:14.600]   That is a king that is in a box, tiny little box.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.040]   Nice gym jumps as well.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.000]   You like my gym jams?
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Those are my special Casper gym jams.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.320]   I did make one mistake, though.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.080]   I opened it in the foyer.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.840]   Probably should have taken it to the bedroom.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.240]   Because once you open it up, it goes--
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.800]   And then it expands up.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.960]   And now it's full size, but watch the comfort.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.520]   Oh, so even though it's got springs,
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.640]   there's no sense of springs.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.800]   It's just a little bit better edge support, a little bit.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.880]   I just love it.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.680]   So soft and comfortable.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.360]   Casper gives you free delivery and painless returns
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.400]   in the US and Canada 100 night risk-free sleep on a trial.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.880]   You call them up, say, I don't like it.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.840]   They will come and get it.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.080]   You don't even have to box it back up or anything.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.200]   Even with the springs, it still fits in that great box,
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.120]   which means it's great for getting into any room,
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:05.800]   any building, even if it's upstairs.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.360]   Look, I want you to get a Casper today.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.400]   So we've got $100 off towards select mattresses.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.160]   If you go to Casper.com/twit1, and you
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.480]   have to use the promo code, twit1,
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.360]   twit in the number one at checkout.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.960]   C-A-S-P-E-R, Casper.com/twit1.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.560]   $100 off select mattresses by going to Casper.com/twit1.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.040]   Promo code, twit1.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.360]   Terms and conditions apply.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:35.240]   I'm telling you, it's hard to explain how nice it is.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.720]   You just have to take my word for it and try it for yourself.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.560]   And then you get up and you come out in the world.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:41.920]   And you--
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.280]   Yeah, it's the hard, brochure, realities of life
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.440]   when you leave the nice warm cozy bed.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:49.200]   This is in a way the same argument we've
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:53.520]   been having about Apple since Hong Kong, since--
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.880]   I mean, it's just since they moved the servers to China,
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:02.160]   obviously Apple has to live by the rules of the nation
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.760]   it's operating in.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.200]   You know, I could put up with it a lot more cheerily.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.400]   If I don't get promoted tweets on my Twitter timeline going,
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.400]   hi, we're Apple.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.600]   We believe in privacy for everyone.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.800]   They set themselves up.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.160]   Yeah, subset unless you live in China or Russia,
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.880]   in which case screw you, we got profits to--
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.920]   So you may remember Russia invaded Crimea.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.160]   It's always been a disputed region.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.360]   It was part of Russia for a while and it wasn't.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.640]   But until they invaded, it was an independent part
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.800]   of the Ukraine.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.280]   I would say it was a part of Ukraine
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.040]   and they did something which was really quite--
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.400]   it hasn't really been done that much these days.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.320]   It was a soft invasion.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.720]   So they flew special forces troops into Crimean airports
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.640]   who then took over the airports and then they flew
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.320]   in troops in on commercial airliners.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.680]   It was an amazing thing.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.200]   But at the same time, it worked whether or not
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.040]   it's ethically there.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.720]   I have severe doubts on that front since--
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.000]   Well, of course, it's less than a good thing.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.680]   International sanctions.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.000]   Instantaneously.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.680]   In the EU, yes, in the US they seem to be easing up
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.640]   on those recently.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.120]   Well, and Apple's eased up a little bit
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.800]   because Russia demanded and Apple agreed to show Crimea
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.880]   the annex plan, so that's part of Russian territory
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.760]   if you're using the maps inside of Russia.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.640]   Now, what I don't know is if Google did the same thing.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.440]   I don't think so.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.120]   Did they?
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:24.840]   Back in March.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:28.040]   They didn't get a lot of attention for that.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:32.800]   Google Maps did that back in March.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.720]   Now, when you view it outside of Russia--
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.280]   It's still part of Ukraine.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:37.880]   It's Ukraine.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.320]   It's not part of any country.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.040]   It's just--
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.760]   So how long until Poland starts nervously eyeing its own?
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:48.400]   Yes, yes, we've seen this movie before.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.320]   Does Apple represent-- they don't represent Taiwan
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:55.800]   as part of China, or do they in China?
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.960]   Because that's another disputed thing, of course.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.560]   That was why there was a movie that--
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.520]   a children's movie that just came out that's been actually
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.600]   banned in several Southeast Asian countries
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:09.160]   because it was a DreamWorks co-production with China.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.520]   It's called Everest, and the characters
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.240]   are shown traveling from one end of China
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.240]   to the other to return a baby yeti to Everest.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:16.760]   Aww.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.360]   It's very heartwarming, except that it's
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.880]   China's version of what they think the world looks like.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.040]   And several Southeast Asian countries
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.720]   have taken issue with where China chose to draw its maps.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.840]   I can think of several million Tibetans
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.080]   who might take interest with the fact
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.480]   that it's not part of China in the first place.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.640]   Yes, and the US, and DreamWorks, are both like, well, tough.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.320]   This is how the movie's going out.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.920]   If you don't like it, your country doesn't have to check.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.360]   Is your mic on Carson?
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:50.880]   Yes, because I was just going to say that in 2013, Taiwan
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.240]   demanded that Apple change the map that
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.760]   chose it as part of China.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.160]   And did they?
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.640]   I'm not sure that they did.
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:03.120]   I know recently that they took out the Taiwanese map
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.480]   from emojis in China.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:04.880]   That's right.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.920]   You only have a flag.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:12.320]   I feel like this is a minefield that any transnational company
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.480]   is going to have to deal with.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.680]   I mean, you have no choice.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.080]   You either say no and then be thrown out.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:19.240]   Right.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.000]   I mean, I can understand if your Russia has passed a law saying
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.560]   that it is a crime within Russia to refer to the Crimea
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.240]   as part of Ukraine.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.360]   It is as is and will always be a part of Russia.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.760]   So I can understand the argument, yeah,
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.960]   we're obeying international laws.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.920]   But then don't build yourself to your core US market
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:45.920]   as we're great defenders of freedom and true facts
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.080]   when you're putting this kind of rubbish.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.520]   Well, I think that the line that Apple seems to be drawing
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.280]   so far is to the phone.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.880]   Everything else is kind of fair game.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.640]   So that Apple has said, here's the deal.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.320]   We're not going to let you into the phone.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.240]   We're not going to give anybody the cryptid part.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.800]   We're not going to-- that part, Apple, I don't think is--
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.880]   I could be wrong, but I don't believe
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.760]   Apple has given that to any country under incredible duress.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.240]   You know, they've said, no, we're not going to do that now.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.920]   The iCloud, everything else is all kind of like what
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.840]   we follow the laws that we have.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.040]   But to some degree, I think that if they're going to draw a line,
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.040]   I'm happy they're drawing at least a line there,
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.240]   because nobody else is.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.400]   I mean, you can't forget, as of 2017,
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.560]   the Apple iPhone dominated approximately 80%
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.680]   of Russia's smartphone market.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.680]   Premium.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.680]   Premium store.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.680]   Premium store.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.680]   So 600 and above.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.680]   There's a lot of people who bought a lot.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.320]   I mean, I think it's a much smaller--
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320]   I think it's like 12%.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.120]   And then China is currently about 20% of Apple's business.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:49.000]   So if you're a CEO and your job is literally to maximize value
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.480]   for shareholders, then these are the things you're staring down
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.400]   where you're like, if I make a very expensive and principled
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.640]   stand, is this going to work for me, the company, the world
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.640]   in general?
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.640]   There's--
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   What?
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   I'm just pointing out this is kind of the--
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.360]   Yeah, I don't envy Tim Apple.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.920]   It's a difficult position to be at.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.840]   I also think that Apple may only have a couple more years in
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.920]   Russia anyway, because there's passing laws now that say that
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.840]   unless you have Russian bills and software, you're not going to
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840]   sell the gadget.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.720]   And so this may only be to get a handful of more sales through--
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.880]   I mean, not handful of millions, but there may be a push for the
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.080]   next couple of years to buy lots of Apple products, because you
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.320]   won't be able to buy them after that.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.960]   You'll have to use the Russian--
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.600]   So this has been having a fire sale in effect?
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.200]   I'm not sure, but I believe that's the case that Russia's
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.200]   going to press down.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.960]   No, they're trying to disconnect.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.280]   If you have to have certain software installed on the--
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.880]   And that's often what you're trying to--
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.880]   You're trying to--
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880]   Yeah, whatever you do.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.200]   That's always the sign of a healthy environment when you're
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.600]   explicitly restricting hardware and software options to your
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600]   citizens.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   Yeah, but it's--
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   I don't know.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.800]   See, there's two different ways to look at it.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.960]   You could also say it's not unreasonable to say there should
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.160]   be Russian written equivalents of software on the phone.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.280]   God bless America.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.880]   We should have America--
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.000]   We always say to mandate--
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.080]   To mandate it in America.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.200]   To mandate it?
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.000]   That's a very--
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.960]   Well, this is all part of both Russia and China trying to
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.360]   control their populations.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:19.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.560]   I mean, they're--
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.360]   We see it that way.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.560]   Maybe they see it as just a patriotic--
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.200]   As a bolstering of national industries?
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:26.960]   Yeah, I see.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.320]   I think that's the way it's going to be sold in to America
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.440]   when it comes in that way as well.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.280]   Because we'll do it--
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.520]   Made in the USA will be a thing.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.040]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.680]   It was just code written by Americans.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.920]   They are ready you're doing it.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.160]   Try and buy a Huawei phone in the United States.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:39.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.680]   Well, I mean, you saw with Trump's visit down to the new
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.480]   Apple factory in Austin, which was new at all.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.080]   Again, poor Tim Apple, who had to sit there.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:49.560]   And--
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.840]   But here's the thing is when I saw--
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.840]   The whole issue is when I saw--
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.520]   When I saw that happen, what I thought is Apple currently
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.920]   also has a news product.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.040]   And if the CEO of the company that has a news product
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.320]   is willing to stand there and not correct a record--
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.440]   --because it's politically expedient for him to do so,
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.520]   why would I trust his company's news product?
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.120]   Why, that's a point I didn't think of.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.680]   No, very--
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.040]   But at one, Lisa, that's brilliant.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.120]   Are they publishing their own--
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.400]   I mean, when I go to the Apple news--
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:17.960]   It's curated.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.480]   It's curated.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.000]   It's curated.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:19.480]   It's curated.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.160]   And if you take--
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:20.600]   And then I went to check--
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.080]   And then I went to check--
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.720]   I went and checked Apple news the day after the factory visit.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.720]   No stories there?
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.080]   It was all glowing victory.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.120]   It was all-- oh, it was a wonderful event.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.520]   The president really loved the--
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.960]   The glorious leader went down very well.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.040]   And they did not mention glorious leaders' factual
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.440]   gaff or tin cooks.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.600]   How interesting.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.720]   Good research, yeah.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.400]   And so I thought to myself, granted, Apple news
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.040]   is not a huge revenue driver for Apple.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.960]   But what this does point to is right now,
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.200]   you have a company that is trying
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.600]   to sell a product with a premium subscription.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.200]   And this is a company that's also shown very publicly
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.200]   and on the record that they are fine
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.400]   with letting lies slide if it's politically expedient.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:58.920]   Wow.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.080]   No, it's the same with Facebook.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.080]   That is quite an indictment.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:01.480]   When Facebook--
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.680]   I was down at a press conference in Menlo Park
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.200]   when Facebook introduced the news feed.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.720]   And they're like, Zuckerberg himself said,
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.080]   we want to become the front page daily news
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.040]   for every Facebook user.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.400]   And then when it turns around and bites them on the backside
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.320]   three years later and there's that actually
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.440]   we're finding defending lies.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.840]   But hey, check out the chat price.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.800]   It's great.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.200]   This is what I'm doing.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.000]   They just this week showed that they're
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.280]   willing to accept a government's definition of what fake news is.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.120]   Facebook.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]   Facebook.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.120]   In Singapore.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:37.960]   Oh, it's the Singapore thing.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.720]   So now this is another interesting story.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.800]   Actually, I pair it with the China story where they announced--
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.320]   And the Dutch case as well.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:51.640]   But China has a law now that it's illegal to make deep fakes.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.680]   And you have to be identified as such,
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.000]   which in fact seems like a good idea.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.560]   And Singapore says, I guess it depends on your point of view
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:05.920]   that if a story is fake, it has to be labeled as such.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.840]   Problem with this one is that the story comes from a dissident
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.000]   Singaporean who is in residence in Australia.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.560]   They're trying to extend this kind of labeling
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.680]   to outside the country.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.800]   Indian governments don't sign their believable.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.200]   So Facebook exceeded again.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.520]   They're in Singapore.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.000]   And put this note as Facebook is legally required to tell you--
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.240]   that's their little--
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.720]   hey, we have to do this--
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.960]   that the Singapore government says this post has false information.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.440]   That's only visible in Singapore, by the way.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:42.600]   The Singapore government said it instructed Facebook
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.400]   to publish a correction notice in that November 23 post, which
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.600]   contained accusations about the arrest of a whistleblower
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.920]   and election ringing in Singapore.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.240]   You know, if it is fake news, then it's appropriate to say,
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.600]   you got to label it as such.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.200]   She took these things.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.600]   I mean, don't we wish we could get Facebook to stop government--
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   politicians from lying in their ads?
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.720]   Do we want that?
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.160]   Do we want our government's definition of fake news?
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.160]   To be--
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.720]   Well, who else is to define it?
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.600]   Well, the person reading it.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.920]   Preferably not our government.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.720]   I mean, we've all been saying what a terrible thing is
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.000]   is that Facebook will accept campaign ads that have lies in them.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.120]   I'm actually not going to the Facebook press party this Christmas
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.920]   because I know I'm going to have a few--
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.720]   That's a strong protest.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.320]   Good job.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:34.720]   I know.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.720]   Rosa Parks.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.880]   Rosa Parks have nothing on me.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.360]   But I know it's--
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.320]   I might go, but I won't eat the shrimp.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.520]   How about that?
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.000]   No, it's just because I know I'd have one too many.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.240]   And just, I mean, Nick Clegg, the head of PR, former British
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.560]   deputy prime minister, he ran an inspirational campaign
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.520]   when he was running on the radio show election.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.280]   And then 10 years later, here he is saying, I think it's perfectly.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.840]   All right, the politician should be able to lie on our platform.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:01.880]   And it just--
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.240]   I know I'd punch someone.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.560]   It's just one of those things.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.920]   Yeah, I want to--
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.160]   My only question-- when have they not been lying?
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.440]   Like, ever.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:10.920]   Well, no, they don't--
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.000]   I used to have the old standard of allegiance--
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   Politicians.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.240]   Legal, decent, honest, and truthful.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.480]   You had to do that in the UK.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480]   But ever hit, maybe not.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.000]   OK, in American press, dating back 150 years,
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.480]   they've been lying through their teeth.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.440]   Every single time.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.600]   Every single one.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.040]   Like, Willie Horton, the costume.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.480]   And so the thing is that I think part of the problem
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.280]   is is that where do you draw the line on what is a lie,
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.240]   and what is bolster, and what is--
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.480]   and who makes that decision?
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.680]   I think that all of this is really much more complicated
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.560]   than oh, I think that you either do what Twitter and Google--
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.320]   Twitter did, which said we just don't want the money,
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.480]   or which I do understand the argument
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.480]   that it definitely damages the ability for the outsiders
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.600]   to get in.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.560]   Because the--
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.080]   Almost is a tradition in this country.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.680]   In fact, there is a mandate from the FCC.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.560]   All broadcast organizations have to accept all political ads
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.200]   for that very reason.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.160]   They can't turn them down because otherwise turning them down
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.040]   some down would slant the news.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.000]   So broadcast organizations are required
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   to accept political advertising.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.880]   But they also have the--
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.160]   I forget what it's called, the Equal Time.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:21.960]   That's gone.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960]   That is the gone for me.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:23.480]   Or they have.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.240]   I believe if you--
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.440]   There's not too long ago, they--
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:25.880]   There's not too long ago.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.400]   They're just seven, unfortunately.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.960]   And that's what led to the rise of--
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.800]   But our ads-- our ads campaigns have been--
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.560]   our ad campaigns in the rhetoric have been
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.080]   lies for 150 years.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.400]   So thinking something's new, I think
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.240]   that what's more important, like with my kids,
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.880]   who were here a minute ago, I give them absurd answers
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.600]   all the time on purpose.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.680]   To give them a test.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.120]   No, they constantly say don't believe any single point.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.160]   No, don't believe any--
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:49.640]   That's great.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   And they have to think about it.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.880]   My wife drives my wife crazy.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.600]   But they'll ask a question that they could Google,
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.040]   and I'll just give them absurd answer.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.320]   And they have to decide whether they're going to--
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:09:59.680]   Yeah, not sure.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.160]   --with a straight or I agree with that.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.400]   So premise.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.320]   But it is--
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.600]   I support that 100%.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.440]   You give your kids--
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:05.880]   Absolutely.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.840]   --because they're going to--
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.360]   Because I don't listen to-- but the thing is,
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.840]   is that I listen to-- I listen to almost all different views
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.120]   against the news.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.160]   And I don't-- and I believe that I don't think that there's
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.680]   any one of them that are right.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.960]   You know, I don't listen to NPR and go, oh, they're telling me
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.320]   the truth.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.280]   I listen to them and go, oh, I get the rank.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.320]   I understand their angle.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.960]   It's getting-- now a day's, it's getting harder and harder.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.320]   You feel like everything you hear has a slant.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.160]   And it's almost--
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.200]   I'd rather have the press play their hand openly.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:33.720]   Yes.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.280]   And say this is where it's slant in my bias.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.080]   But they all deny bias.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.280]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.760]   And you can't tell, but you know there's a slant.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.840]   But even the times there's a slant--
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.160]   I mean, this is the thing I do actually enjoy about partisan
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.880]   media is they're not pretending to impartiality
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.240]   or objectivity or doing this well,
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.520]   the culture of the news.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.080]   They're like, no, we're coming from a right.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.240]   But I really don't want to live in a world where facts are
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.080]   slippery.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:58.680]   No, I mean--
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.560]   Well, the thing that bothers me about Facebook
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.360]   is they really have no problem bending to whoever
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.720]   is going to scream the loudest or make their head--
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.520]   They're-- they're--
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.160]   On the site, they have one responsibility.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.360]   It's to their shareholders.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.360]   They're shareholders.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.600]   I mean, my editor was talking about this.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.960]   He said, he accidentally clicked on Joe Rogan podcast.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.440]   All of a sudden, his YouTube suggested windows
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.800]   were full of climate and oil gun rights, you know?
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.760]   Just like-- and there is that willing amplification
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:28.920]   effect that you were saying.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.480]   Well, this is the--
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.520]   And I have to admit, I'm careful about what I click on.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.640]   Like, I click on things and I go, I know that I'm voting
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.480]   and I click on that.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.480]   Like, I'm voting--
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.640]   Every click is a present.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.160]   I was--
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:37.720]   I watched that.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.480]   But what I mean is, as I know that I've--
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.200]   I've told that AI bot that I want more of that,
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.000]   if I click on it.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.400]   So I quickly go past it because I'm like, I don't want more--
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.400]   I watched-- I was at a panel where
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.840]   a couple of the YouTube designers were talking about how
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.120]   they were-- oh, here's how we're using user data
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.400]   and how we're making the product better.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.920]   And their definition of making the product better
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:00.000]   was, how can we get children to engage in our product longer?
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.640]   And the fact that their first priority was sustained engagement
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.520]   and not, how can we make sure that kids aren't
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.880]   watching kitten stomping videos or what have you,
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.160]   should tell you right there that--
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.680]   Oh, God, that one's going to live with me tonight.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.360]   That's it.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.240]   The first priority for all of these platforms is not--
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.440]   well, the first priority for these platforms
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.680]   is shareholder value.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.880]   The second priority for these platforms is stickiness.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.720]   It has nothing to do with quality of content
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.360]   or bringing people together or anything like that.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:27.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.360]   But if there's a perceived gap with how people--
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.760]   people are like, oh, Facebook, it brings my family together.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:33.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:34.280]   But I'm sorry.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280]   But I'm sorry about it to give that speech.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:35.720]   But I was still--
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:36.600]   Why is it a gap going?
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.600]   I was just getting out of the way.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.120]   I guess it's the question.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:38.320]   Do we--
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.200]   Do tech press fail by not saying, hey, this is what this is.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.160]   You are essentially a data generating entity.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.440]   Do we hold them at a higher level than they should be?
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.400]   I mean, we worked in radio.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:57.320]   I mean, the entire design of when I design--
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.560]   I speak program director for radio station,
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.240]   I'm a music director.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.280]   And so the entire design is about stickiness.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.640]   And it's about pulling on your little heart strength.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.480]   What's the difference?
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.040]   Season of returns is all about getting you.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.640]   We did the best we could.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.080]   But the difference between that and Facebook and Google
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.120]   and modern digital platforms, we didn't have the feedback
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.120]   loop that they have.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:16.560]   But we would have.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.440]   So we would have if we could have.
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.440]   But we didn't.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.200]   If best you got a ratings book every quarter.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   You know, it would take three months to find out
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.000]   if it was working.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.040]   And even then, it was an imperfect science.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.160]   That feedback loop is so highly refined in modern digital
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.120]   technologies that they're too good.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.080]   They've been weaponized.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.960]   But I think everybody's doing link bait.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.000]   But it's been weaponized by these digital platforms.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.440]   But I think as a user, we have to decide--
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.440]   I think that the responsibility is going to end up
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.360]   being in the user's hands.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.040]   Whereas--
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.760]   Well, it has to be, unfortunately.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760]   We have to look at that news.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.640]   I mean, the news has never been the news.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.280]   Like, the news has never been true.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.320]   The news has been what somebody pushed from some
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.760]   different direction from somewhere.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.720]   And we have to get to a point where we can discern it.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.720]   And the thing--
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:01.560]   And how do you discern it?
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560]   If you don't know--
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.120]   You know it's slanted, but you don't know why or by whom.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.400]   You don't know what--
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.480]   which things are facts and which are not facts.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.400]   And there's no reliable source.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.480]   How do you discern it?
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.040]   So generally for me-- and I don't
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.840]   know whether I'm discerning the truth or not--
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.320]   but I look at it from many different angles,
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   whether I want to see what Fox says about it.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.080]   I want to see what NPR says about it.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.320]   MSNBC, Al Jazeera, the things that they all agree on,
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.720]   probably pretty close to the truth.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.560]   The things that they-- everything else is probably BS.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.480]   And so it's their own little version
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.360]   of their angle or whatever.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.240]   And when you see that, when you're watching all of those,
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.560]   very quickly you know what their angle is.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.160]   If you look at five or six different ranging
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.920]   from conservative to liberal, you will very quickly--
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.080]   What if they don't agree on anything?
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.560]   They wrote so far they're agreeing
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.560]   like that somebody went somewhere.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.120]   You know, and then called sets of--
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.120]   And sets of things.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.000]   But I think agreement on facts is even a roting.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.240]   But I think that it's--
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.160]   I think also it's constant sampling.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.520]   We can't just assume that whatever we see coming up
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.680]   in front of us, and I don't think we ever should have.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.880]   I think we just happen to--
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.720]   there's a lot of things we believe.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.200]   We got into a whole war in Southeast Asia
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.520]   based on news that wasn't true.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.800]   Yeah, but they are big.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.120]   And that's the big news.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.120]   The Gulf of Tonkin resolution.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.360]   No, this is what drives me up.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.960]   So I mean, OK, I'm getting on a bit.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.960]   But I'm glad my first editor is dead in a way
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.120]   because if he'd seen the state that we are in right now,
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.320]   I mean, if you couldn't justify a fact
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.560]   that you were putting in print, he would slap you silly.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.320]   And it's got to-- I think we've got to extend this.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.040]   If you've got to put something out there as facts,
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.400]   then you've got to be able to justify it.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.160]   So it's not nostalgic of us to say there used to be standards?
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.640]   No, that absolutely used to be standards.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.640]   I mean, we used to--
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.640]   I've been in companies where we have
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.240]   fired journalists on the spot for making up facts.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.200]   We had one guy who made up a quote out of whole cloth
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.240]   when he admitted to it.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.800]   The answer was, all right, pack your stuff, get the hell out.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.280]   But there's far more subtle ways of slanting news
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.280]   that are making up facts.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:06.800]   There are.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.200]   But at the point, subtlety has been lost at this point.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:10.720]   Yes.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.360]   You know, it's just let's make it up at a whole cloth.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.320]   And in 24 hours, it starts to--
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.320]   When you have a president-- and I'm not
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.080]   trying to be political here, but I
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.240]   think it's very clear to everybody,
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.640]   either you have a president who willingly
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.360]   lies at any juncture.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.440]   And there's no consequences.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.680]   And there's no consequences.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   I mean, that's the thing.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.280]   It starts at the top.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.400]   It suddenly means, I think it tells everybody in this country
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.520]   and many degrees around the world that facts don't matter.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.040]   We used to have a minister called John Profumo in the UK
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.320]   over the early '60s.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.320]   Oh, I remember the professor.
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.320]   He was caught lying--
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.760]   --recourt lying to Parliament about having
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.600]   an affair with a prostitute.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.720]   And when he was caught out, he resigned.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.440]   He devoted the rest of his life to working
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.160]   at the Bernardo's charity and withdrew completely
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.040]   from public life.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:54.520]   Right.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.120]   Now we'd have no politicians if that was the way.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120]   He'd be on Dancing With the Stars to definitely
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.600]   worship they come dancing.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.400]   I don't know which is the worst punishment.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400]   I know.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.480]   You're right, though.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.200]   He would.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.680]   But to get back to something Alex said earlier, where he's
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.600]   like, yeah, I give my kids the wrong answer,
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.920]   one of the behaviors I've noticed with my nine-year-old
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.320]   daughter, which I find fascinating,
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.320]   is before she asks Syria a question,
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.520]   she asks two to three test questions,
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.760]   where she already knows the answer.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.480]   Because she wants to see--
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.960]   She's a little lie detector.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.920]   Well, she wants to see how well Syria knows her serious stuff.
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.520]   So this way she won't trust an answer from Syria
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.120]   until she can gauge how accurate
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.200]   Syria versus Google is.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.280]   I kind of want to teach my kids that it's important to tell
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.480]   the truth at all times.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.640]   But maybe that was a fashion concept.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640]   I--
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.520]   I--
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.440]   When it's important, I tell them the truth.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.720]   So when I believe in the truth in every respect--
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.120]   I don't know.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.400]   I think it's to the best your ably on Christmas day
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.160]   when you go to the bathroom.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:48.760]   I did tell them.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.280]   I was just like--
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.320]   Oh, thank you, Ansey.
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.760]   I'll treasure it forever.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.480]   I used to write letters from Santa in a very shaky script.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:57.480]   You're right.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.120]   That's a lie.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.200]   There's many things that I would consider important.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.080]   I definitely stay very close to the truth.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.360]   But I think that there are--
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:08.640]   when we're talking about things that can be absurd,
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.280]   that part of it is building a muscle that says,
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.880]   don't just believe what people say when you come in.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:12.920]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.800]   Don't be gullible.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.280]   Don't be belive.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.360]   Why is the sky blue, Alex?
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:15.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.040]   And I would make something up.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.600]   There's a little guy up there with an egg drop.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.200]   We used to have classes at school.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.200]   And I have an A-level in media studies, which sounds like the most
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.280]   Mickey Mouse degree ever.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.440]   But actually, for two years, you looked at the media.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.360]   And it's like, how are they slanting this?
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.800]   What images are they using it?
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.920]   Why are they using it?
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.240]   It's really media literacy.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:34.920]   Yeah, but that is.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.280]   And I honestly think that should be--
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.200]   That's all I mean for me.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.360]   One of the eye-openers for me was I was in Zimbabwe
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.880]   during the elections in 2000.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.280]   This was the big elections that happened in Zimbabwe.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.080]   And I happened to be there doing some other work.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.320]   But I was there on the election night.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.640]   And I watched-- I'm standing where CNN International
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:53.720]   is reporting.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.720]   Like, I'm two blocks from them.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.520]   And they're reporting this huge crowd of people
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.920]   that were all excited about the elections.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.320]   And I lean out.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.680]   There's nobody in the streets.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.320]   And I look way down there.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.800]   And there's 20 people around a camera.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.400]   And what they did is they took the camera,
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.320]   and they rocked it up high and pointed it down
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.200]   so that they could show a crowd.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.760]   You know, there was maybe 30 people there.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.960]   But it was like--
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.440]   They do this in the movies all the time.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.440]   Yeah, the thing is that--
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.120]   But if you want to show it, you want to make it look like it.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.840]   Because if they had just brought that camera down--
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.000]   And again, it's not lying, but it's not the truth.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.960]   And that's where the press is--
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.600]   It's been slanting.
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.640]   --been slanting forever since the day it existed.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:39.280]   And I think that we have to be clear that just because something
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.840]   is fact-checked and everything else
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.840]   doesn't mean that it hasn't been slanted.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.240]   As you were stating, who you choose to interview
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.680]   and how you ask those questions and where you go with those things.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.880]   Again, it's not lying, but it's not the truth.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:58.520]   And we just have to-- and it's important for us as viewers
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:03.440]   to become intelligent and to educate ourselves
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.720]   by looking at it from different angles,
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.160]   by not believing just what we're being handed.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.920]   We're all much more cynical than we used to be.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.320]   Well, it needs to be part of something that happens in school,
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:12.840]   too.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.800]   I don't know if it's part of civics,
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.320]   or if you work it into literature since you can argue
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.000]   that visual--
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.400]   --vigstive ex in American schools these days.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:18.600]   Yes.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.760]   I don't know if they do these days.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.040]   I have.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:20.960]   They do the best they can.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:27.960]   But you can also argue that visual literacy is as vital to being
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.680]   a 21st century citizen.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.240]   And visually and as it is.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:31.760]   Internet literacy.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.240]   Written literacy.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:32.720]   Written literacy.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:33.080]   Do they?
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:33.580]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.080]   They try.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.600]   They try.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.880]   It's a challenge.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.960]   And if it's not in school, at least you
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.880]   have schoolhouse rocks.
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.380]   Oh, man.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.320]   I'm just a bill.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.920]   I don't know if you can find that on YouTube anymore.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.200]   The algorithm may actually weight it against you.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.600]   Oh, it probably does.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.120]   It only does.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.240]   Let's take a little break.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.840]   More of our really fabulous panel.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.480]   I was worried, because Thanksgiving week,
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.080]   there's usually not a lot of tech news.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.640]   Tech meme had the same 10 stories
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.600]   in the top all day long yesterday and the day before
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.440]   and the day before.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.000]   But we found some things to talk about.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.640]   Ian Thompson's here from the register.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   He's not here.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.440]   He was here.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.240]   He's a ghost.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.800]   He registered at Kodak UK.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.520]   Hi, Ian.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.000]   He's going out to get a cup of tea.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.440]   As he should, Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:19.600]   I don't think I really introduced you at Alex Lindsay on the Twitter
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.080]   S.A.Y.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.240]   And of course, because Alex is back in town,
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.280]   he's done imaging Angkor water, whatever it was you were doing.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.240]   We're going to have you on Macbreak weekly again Tuesday.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:29.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.080]   And I've been starting to ask questions on Twitter
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:36.080]   about what some of these things are making you guess at things.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.400]   And other things are me trying to figure something out.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.920]   We had a big piece of fruit that I couldn't figure out
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.040]   what it was.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.440]   And so we're totally sure what it was.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.640]   But I did open it, need it live on Twitter.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.960]   So where did you get it?
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.680]   It was a giant lemon that was growing outside my house.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.920]   But we couldn't figure out what it was.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.440]   Was it lemony?
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.000]   It was very lemony.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   It's usually a giveaway.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.920]   But it was like the size of a soccer ball, except it's a lemon.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.280]   And so there was a big discussion
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.600]   about whether it was ponderosa lemon or whether it was a citron or etrog or--
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.960]   And even after we cut it open, there's not a lot of certainty about it.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.080]   But then--
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.240]   So anyway, so--
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.920]   Twitter knows all.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.160]   I've been leaving on my followers.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.840]   I've been leaning on my Twitter followers to educate me.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.680]   I have an aircraft part that next week we'll talk about.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.120]   Isn't there a name for that lazy Twitter or something like that?
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.000]   Crowds, personally?
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.840]   Well, it is crowds.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:25.640]   But there's a Twitter.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.760]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.280]   That's a Schmiza.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.800]   Lisa Schmiza, we love having you on from ITPro today.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.520]   I love being on.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.680]   Thank you.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.360]   It's so nice to have a smart panel for a change.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.720]   Those guys last week-- oh, no, I'm doing the--
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.160]   I'm doing the comic thing.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.120]   That audience last week, they sucked.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.680]   Actually, yesterday we had a lot of fun.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:51.200]   We had a very smart person in here, Steve Gibson, doing his squirrel unveil.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.440]   He's got a new authentication technology that he thinks solves the whole password problem.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.400]   It's really impressive.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.120]   He's put a lot of effort into it, working out for five years.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:00.960]   Finally unveiled it.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.440]   And now we've got to get the word out and get people adopting it.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.240]   But he did a really fabulous presentation, which is on our--
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.160]   it's the first item on our new events feed.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:19.320]   So you can see the squirrel story at twitch.tv/--
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.080]   what is it?
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:20.640]   Events?
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.920]   What is-- I don't even know what the URL is now.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.480]   Events.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.000]   Events.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:25.520]   Events.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.280]   Twitter.tv/events.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.120]   That's where our CES coverage will go.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120]   Can you believe it?
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.280]   A month now?
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.240]   Oh, no.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.440]   I'm so glad I'm not going.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.640]   From now, you're not going either?
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.040]   Nope.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.080]   You're not going either?
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:38.400]   It was a--
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.200]   Why am I going?
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.440]   It was one of the conditions of me joining the register.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:41.960]   Are you going?
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:42.400]   I don't have your--
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.360]   Anymore CES.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:43.960]   You can help us.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:44.920]   We might need some help.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.360]   OK.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.120]   Actually, we're going to have fun.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:50.000]   It's going to be Ant and Leo's excellent CES adventure.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.840]   I'm playing it like innocence abroad.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.640]   We're going to go there.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.760]   I haven't been there in years.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.560]   It will, in effect.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.560]   I think after five years, you are a CES virgin, right?
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.000]   Probably.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.640]   You recover your virginity.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.560]   And I'm going to go down there with Ant.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.600]   As a financial student.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.320]   We are going to-- we've got Samable Sammett.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.200]   Our car guy is going to show us the North Hall, all the car
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:09.960]   stuff.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.360]   Dick D. Bartolo is going to show us
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.800]   the crap in the basement of the Sands, which
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.640]   is always a lot of fun.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.280]   Scott Wilkinson is going to take us on a tour of audio
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.080]   and visual and television.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.480]   And we-- let's see.
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:21.800]   Who else?
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.040]   Oh, Stacey Higginbotham is going to be there doing IoT.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:24.640]   Could you help us?
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:25.480]   I can help.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.400]   You can do some.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.720]   So we're going to give you a tour of CES.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.440]   I'm hoping to do 10 or 20 segments a day.
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.280]   Just a ton of them.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.560]   Just crank them out.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.440]   It'll be a lot of fun.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.840]   I'll hold the camera that handled it,
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.360]   that handled the camera while I do it.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.320]   It should be a lot of fun.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   That will be the next thing on our feet.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.440]   So you want to subscribe to the Twitter events feed,
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.640]   Twitter.tv/events.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.600]   Do we have a promo, Carson?
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.640]   We do not have a promo.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.120]   OK.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:50.920]   Well, I just did the--
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:51.560]   --in the notification.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.760]   I just did the promo.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.120]   Yes.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.280]   Right there.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.800]   I showed today, brought to you by LastPass, another promo.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.640]   Very good news.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.680]   You know how there's Citibank Field and Quicken Loans Arena?
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.400]   We've been trying for as long as I've been here
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.240]   to sell naming rights to the studio.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.560]   I thought this was kind of a nutty idea, right?
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.400]   We sold it to LastPass.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.600]   Shh, don't tell him.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.040]   It's a great idea.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.360]   No, no, it is a great idea.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.280]   It's because it's going to be--
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.760]   the people say, are you still twit?
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.760]   Yes, it's still twit.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.240]   But we're-- instead of the Brickhouse studios
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:26.440]   or the East Side studios, we're now at the LastPass studio.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.920]   So that'll start January 1st.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.600]   We're really thrilled.
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.040]   We love LastPass.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.440]   And it's a perfect partner because, as you probably know,
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.320]   I've been using and recommending LastPass
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.680]   long before they ever became an advertiser for a decade
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.760]   since they started.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.120]   Steve Gibson, about five years ago,
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.680]   I asked him, have you used LastPass?
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.240]   He interviewed Joe Seagrecht.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:45.680]   He interviewed.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.440]   He went over and talked to Joe.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.040]   The creative LastPass looked at the source code
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.200]   and said, yeah, they're doing it exactly right.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.640]   LastPass, even since then, has been getting better and better
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.520]   and better.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.520]   It's an award-winning password vault.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.640]   I should probably explain what it is.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.400]   Password vault, a password manager.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.960]   That helps millions of individuals and over 58,000 organizations
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.120]   navigate their online lives easily and securely.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.600]   Normally, that's a--
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.200]   kind of those two don't go together.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.400]   It's either convenient or secure, but not both.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.960]   But LastPass is both.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.160]   LastPass helps you generate long, strong passwords
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:25.520]   that are completely unmemorable, stores them
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.080]   in its encrypted vault, and pops them up and fills them
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.120]   in wherever you are anytime you need them.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.880]   The vault is never decrypted except on your devices
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.480]   with your special log.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.960]   And I actually use a Yubiki because they support two-factor
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.560]   too.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.760]   So I make sure nobody can get to my vault.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.040]   But man, it's there when I need it on Windows, on Mac, on Linux.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.000]   In every browser, iOS and Android 2,
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.760]   it is a truly awesome product.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.600]   And in business, it's so important because we just
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.200]   got a new bookkeeper.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.960]   It makes it really easy to share with different team members
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.640]   and even teams so that that way a new team member
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.000]   is integrated in right away.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.480]   We have folders for ops, for engineering, for finance.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.280]   LastPass minimizes the risk and gives your IT team a break
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.000]   because users can reset their passwords, no lockouts.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.800]   There are a variety of authentication solutions,
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.080]   including not just two-factor but multi-factor that
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:25.280]   takes advantage of geolocation, IP address, users, behavior.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.800]   So you really know that the people who
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.200]   are using your resources are the right people,
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.640]   people who are supposed to.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.000]   You completely can manage and control user access
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.880]   for every access point in your organization.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.920]   I love their identity solutions.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:41.160]   And I love the dashboard we get with an integrated view
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.440]   across all access and authentication tasks.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.280]   So we know who's accessing what, when, and where.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.000]   Securely manage every password in your business
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.120]   because these days, the Post-it note on the monitor
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.200]   is just not a good way to store a password.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.720]   I was at the drugstore the other day
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:00.800]   and I saw they sell little books that have the label.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.680]   They say on the front of the book, my passwords.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.520]   I think that's handy.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.520]   When somebody breaks into your house,
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.040]   they should know where to go
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.800]   to take all your passwords with them.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.960]   That's why I use LastPass.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.960]   In fact, I trust it so much.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.840]   We store all of everything in there,
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:17.000]   including Wi-Fi, log-in, software licenses, employee IDs.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   I put my personal LastPass vault passwords,
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.360]   but also social security numbers, my passports in there,
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.440]   my driver's license.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.160]   It's secure, it's safe.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.880]   When I travel, I have LastPass with me.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.640]   And if I lose my password, I know I have an image of it,
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.120]   but no one else can get it only me.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:38.240]   LastPass, enterprise for the business, LastPass family,
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.200]   for your family, LastPass premium for you.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.280]   There's a LastPass for everybody.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.080]   And they've just expanded their business lineup
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.360]   with some great features.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.200]   You're gonna love it.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.280]   I want you to check it out, lasspass.com/twit.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.000]   And find out how LastPass can help you
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.480]   in your business and your life.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:57.960]   lasspass.com/twit, and soon we'll be welcoming
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.200]   into the Twit LastPass studio.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.600]   - It makes it easy to be very aggressive
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.440]   about your passwords.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.560]   I have these long hashes because I just go,
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.400]   "Ah, just turn it on."
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.160]   And I'm not gonna try to remember what that is.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.000]   'Cause I have it on all my devices.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.400]   And the ability to share a login without sharing the password.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.440]   And our company was key.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:16.680]   We worked on a lot of secure events,
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.760]   and it just became the secondary, second nature
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.520]   that you'd send somebody, like you have to log into this account,
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.320]   but I don't wanna give you the password.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.440]   Because the password can also tell you
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.800]   how people build their passwords.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:33.440]   - Your Amazon Echo can now sound excited or disappointed.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.120]   - I'm disappointed in you, Ian.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:35.960]   - Question is.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:39.000]   - Probably 'cause I refuse to have one of those devices
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.400]   in the home at all sorts.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.400]   (laughing)
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.400]   - It's a clarity.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:43.960]   - Yeah, no, you don't have one.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.960]   - No smart devices.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.200]   - You probably don't like this
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.760]   because this just makes it more like a human.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:53.480]   - I do find, I mean, do you remember when Google IO announced
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.840]   they got the sort of the automatic call back service with AI?
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.600]   - Yeah, with a prosody, they're using prosody.
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.440]   - Oh yeah, well yeah, where they were.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.280]   - Shape it.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.080]   - You know, the IO would actually pause mid sentence,
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:04.080]   you know, that's really to make itself more believable.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.640]   I hate that.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.200]   - No, what it was doing is the AI was thinking.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.200]   So instead of just having a dead space,
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.720]   they put an arm in there.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.040]   'Cause that's what humans do when they're thinking.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.120]   Notice, I don't say I'm much.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:18.960]   I don't think.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.200]   (laughing)
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.760]   - It's all those years of radio.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:23.960]   - I don't actually have to think.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.360]   I just talk.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.200]   Talking about--
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.040]   - And dad was a crime, yeah.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.440]   - That's my specialty, it is.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.280]   - Yeah.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.120]   - No dead air.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.760]   So this is actually something that you can,
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.880]   as a developer use, there is a syntax,
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:40.880]   they call it SSML for indicating with a tag
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:43.120]   how the voice should sound,
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.480]   whether it's excited or disappointed.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.600]   - Sorry, I've just got this image of the sake of going,
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.560]   I've got a terrible pain, the diode.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.880]   - Oh, I love the damn one side.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.320]   You wanna hear, here's disappointed.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.400]   Here's disappointed echo.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.960]   Oh, you gotta have my sound on, is my sound on on?
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:57.800]   Let's play it again.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:01.040]   - I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.480]   - That's slightly, you wanna hear more disappointed?
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.320]   - Yes.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.280]   - This is even more.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:08.480]   - I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.960]   - That's pretty impressive.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.920]   You wanna hear really disappointed echo?
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.400]   I don't wanna say the A word.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.440]   - I'm playing a single hand in what looks like
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.160]   a losing game.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.480]   - That's so sad.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.600]   - Are the feelings contextual, for example,
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.120]   if you ask Amazon Echo something,
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.560]   and it tells you no, it says,
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.840]   "I'm sorry, this traffic is 40 seconds."
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.720]   - It's done manually with an SSML tech.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.480]   So the developer has to tag it.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.440]   - All right, so I guess what I'm trying to understand here
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:42.440]   is why a consumer would willingly have a doubt or...
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.280]   (laughing)
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.280]   - The consumer doesn't get a choice.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:49.840]   So the idea is when you're programming this,
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:53.160]   like say you're doing a jeopardy, a attribute,
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.520]   and the person gets it wrong,
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.680]   you can use the SSML tag that says disappointed,
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.000]   and then they'll actually say,
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.160]   "Instead of, I'm sorry, you're wrong."
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.640]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.640]   She'll pull an Alex Trebek.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.000]   Actually, that would be an even better tag.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.760]   Like, super-siliously condescendingly disappointed.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:11.880]   (laughing)
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.520]   That would be a good tag, or just call it the Trebek.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.880]   - So really, the opportunity here is to figure out
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.120]   how to write the suite of scripts
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.520]   that can do contextual things.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.360]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.520]   - So really, that's who does it.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.440]   - And then slam in the appropriate emotions.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.280]   - It's not AI.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.120]   - So they don't have some poor person.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:25.960]   - That's right.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.880]   Oh, they should do a sarcasm one.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.200]   It'd be like, "Tell me what the temperature is."
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.720]   Oh, you will know what the temperature is.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.200]   Do you look out the window.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.680]   - 53 degrees if you just open your eyes.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.600]   - I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.440]   - That's a little...
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.280]   - That's a little...
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.120]   - Is that the normal one or the two?
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:42.960]   - That's a little.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:43.800]   - That's a little excited.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:44.640]   - I wanna hear.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.480]   - I'm no excited.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:48.920]   - I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:49.840]   - Sorry about those blips.
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:51.320]   That sounds YouTube's positive.
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.160]   - It's crazy.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.000]   - And this is really...
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.840]   - It's losing B.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.680]   - This is high intensity.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.520]   Ready?
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:56.920]   She's really excited about her losing hand.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.200]   - I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.200]   - Oh boy.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.880]   Isn't that cool?
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.400]   - Okay, that sounds as though cocaine was involved
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.760]   somewhere on the side.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.440]   - That's kind of what I would want
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.600]   is I would like the wildly inappropriate reactions.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.800]   (laughing)
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.640]   - They also...
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.800]   - You were searching funeral homes, right?
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.200]   - Well, that's right.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.440]   You don't wanna be too happy.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.960]   So that's exactly...
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.240]   - Well, you know what this reminds me of?
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.240]   And I think I said this when we were talking before the show.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.960]   In William Gibson's book Mona Lisa Overdrive,
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.000]   one of the characters at the beginning, Angela,
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.560]   is talking to her house's smart computer.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:35.200]   And she decides that she's in such a foul mood
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.080]   that she wants the house computer to be terrified of
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.640]   or the house computer's like this.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.680]   And she's like, "No, make it more intense."
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.520]   And the computer's like,
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:43.880]   "Please, pick up the phone."
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.800]   And she's like, "Fine, keep it at that intensity."
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:46.800]   - That's what you want.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.040]   But I think what unsettles me,
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.800]   both about that anecdote and this potential
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.920]   for the technology is you may have people who are like,
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.400]   it makes me feel big and powerful
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.200]   to have the machine afraid of me.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.280]   And...
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.840]   - That's probably not a good thing.
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.480]   - Yeah, it's socially maladaptive in a way, I think.
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.200]   - So Beatmaster asks in our chat room,
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.800]   should we anthropomorphize, he says AI,
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.960]   but speak, I don't know if these are AI exactly,
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.120]   speaking, assisted speech assistance at all.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.200]   Should we, shouldn't we make them sound more robotic,
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.560]   not less?
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.080]   - I agree with them to be quite frank.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:17.920]   - Me too.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.880]   - Yeah, I don't like it when parents teach their children,
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.200]   well, I don't know, I've mixed it up.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.640]   - I don't think you should anthropomorphize animals,
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.080]   and I think technology's the same way, so.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.400]   - But you tell kids not to be mean to the dog,
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.000]   don't talk meanly to the dog.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.680]   - Because the dog is a living creature that...
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.520]   - It senses it.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.880]   - Yeah, exactly, it's not anthropomorphizing.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:39.080]   But what do you tell your kids not to be mean to echo?
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.600]   - Again, we don't have that in the house.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.200]   - We don't either.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:43.880]   - We don't either.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:44.720]   - Oh no, no, I do.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.080]   - Oh yeah, I do, everyone.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:46.920]   - Everyone, my kids.
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.520]   - I don't just have echo, I have echo and Google.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.000]   - I have, in the same room, in our kids,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.880]   in that echo, and apple.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:55.720]   - Can you set the message?
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.720]   - So when one doesn't get the answer, you go,
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:59.600]   you're like, echo, and we ask that,
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.320]   typically echo is the one that doesn't quite get it,
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.520]   and you go over to the apple one, and you go,
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.760]   okay, what's the answer to that?
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.640]   - I'm waiting for echo to correct Siri.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.320]   I would love it if they did Iraq.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.600]   - What we do do is we do have an apple TV,
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.560]   so we do have a voice activated Siri for that.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.480]   And whenever my husband and I talk to Siri with apple TV,
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.520]   we do say Siri, please rewind 30 seconds.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.360]   - You say please.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.080]   - Yeah, we model please and thank you,
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.240]   because we wanna make sure that we don't,
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.560]   that we wanna make sure we don't normalize the idea
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.840]   that you can verbally abuse technology.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.920]   - But you can.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.640]   - You can, but that kind of behavior,
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.680]   it's almost a pair of social relationship,
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.480]   and then that kind of behavior becomes normalized.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.880]   Social reactions as well.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.400]   - I'm the same with, I mean,
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.800]   the one voice activation thing I use is Google Assistant.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:44.960]   When I turn it on, it's just like,
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.720]   "Hi, Google, can you give me directions home, please?"
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.400]   And my wife found this is hilarious,
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.040]   but it's just like,
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.800]   and actually Google did something very interesting.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.160]   When they think the last build,
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.840]   if you've got a child's voice on there,
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.840]   it will thank you for saying thank you and being polite.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:01.680]   - Oh.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.520]   - That's actually a really good way
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.480]   of encouraging politeness.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.680]   - Or anti-promorphization.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.560]   - I know, but I just, I think machines should be machines
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.400]   and humans should be humans for the next decade or so,
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.120]   until it becomes impossible to see the two
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.160]   that separate the two, because we'll--
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.920]   - Well, there was a really great study that came out
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.920]   in the '90s that found out that people actually
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:23.200]   regarded the characters on television as their friends.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.160]   They actually had closer emotional connections to them
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.040]   than they did some of the people in their life.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.280]   And the researchers said,
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.800]   "Well, they see these people once a week.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.720]   The TV characters are more steady presences in their life.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:35.960]   They don't demand much.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.600]   It's a rewarding parasocial relationship."
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.880]   And I think that we're going to see the same type of thing
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.520]   with technology, where people are like,
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.720]   when I ask human beings questions, it can be stressful.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.640]   And I don't know how to ask the right question.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.160]   But Siri doesn't get mad if I have to rephrase my question
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.120]   five or six times.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.200]   I still find out an answer.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.320]   I can rely on them.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.880]   That said, I don't think it should be with the people voice.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.120]   I think it should be used very clearly and explicitly
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.520]   as a tool, so there's less of a chance of there being
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.600]   this heavy duty emotional identification.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:09.160]   And there's definitely many things that I would rather
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.560]   have a machine do for me.
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.280]   You know, there's many things I like when I,
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.800]   if I have to call United,
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:16.280]   it's because everything else broke, right?
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.920]   You know, like I'm not going to call them to ask them.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:19.760]   That's a last choice.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.600]   Yeah, the last choice is that I'm going to call.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.840]   And when, now I will say,
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.440]   honestly, I just want to say my cable bill
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.400]   inflates to $300 because I so don't want to talk to Comcast.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:28.560]   Oh my God.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:29.680]   I think they bankled that.
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.960]   What they're really figuring out is how high can we raise
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.360]   this bill before he'll call us?
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.040]   Well, I just, I don't want to talk to them.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.200]   Well, and the funny thing is that the United,
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:41.040]   the humans that I talk on at United are exceptionally good
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.880]   at what they do.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.400]   There's nothing wrong with what they're doing.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.240]   No, they're not sexy.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:45.080]   They're very nice.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:45.920]   They're very smart.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.480]   They handle all the little weird things
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.160]   that might need to get handled.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.840]   So it's not that they're doing anything wrong.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.440]   It's just that I would prefer to do it quietly
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.800]   while I'm doing something else
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.440]   and just have it just sort of, come on.
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.600]   You're an introvert like the rest of us.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.280]   All of us geeks really don't want it to be.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.280]   Well, yeah.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.920]   When I took my first tech writing class
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.960]   in college, the best thing the professor said was,
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.400]   remember that anytime somebody picks up the manual,
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.360]   it's because they've already screwed up on their own
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.520]   and they're looking for answers.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:13.080]   So you have to understand, no one reads a manual.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:13.920]   That's good.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.640]   She's like, no one reads a manual first.
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.040]   They always read it when they're upset
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.400]   and confused and need answers.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.880]   So write with that in mind.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.240]   That's really good.
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.120]   And I would actually like to see more digital assistance
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.840]   developed from that perspective too,
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:28.080]   where if you're calling on an assistant,
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.720]   it's because you need something.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.280]   So, you know, do it for that reason.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.880]   And consider the human.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:34.680]   Yes.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:35.680]   Yes.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:39.480]   There's a sign in the Bigel, Sweatshop.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.680]   Consider the human.
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:49.320]   I don't know if, you know, Lisa brazed this
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.360]   and I was actually kind of like stunned.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.960]   And I don't know if this is an issue or not.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.640]   There is a email authentication,
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.000]   there's actually several email authentication technologies.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:02.840]   Looking demo.
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.320]   One of them is DMARC.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.920]   There's SPIF and there's D Kim.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:14.920]   If you use one of our sponsors devices for your email,
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.280]   it automatically does all of those.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.960]   If you use Gmail, I think it does all of those.
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:20.640]   But not all email providers do it.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.720]   And what the idea of DMARC is it proves you are the sender.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:31.720]   And more importantly, it allows inbound email recipients
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.080]   to block unauthenticated mail.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.520]   And it's one way of fighting spam
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:40.040]   because nobody in sending spam can be authenticable.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.840]   Apparently, according to Zach Whitaker,
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.040]   very good tech guy at TechCrunch.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.520]   Very good.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:49.720]   DMARC is barely being used by the presidential candidates.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:53.000]   Only seven of the Democrats are using.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.320]   He actually has a little table here.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.400]   The green is people who are using email authentication.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.120]   Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg, Steve Bullock.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.560]   I don't even know who he is.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.880]   Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar,
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.080]   Telsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker,
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.520]   all are doing it right.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.720]   I think Bullock is the Montana candidate.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:14.560]   Oh, is he?
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.480]   He's the crooked Democrat from Montana.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.840]   And Carson says that because he's from Montana, so he knows.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:21.840]   It does sound like a very bad guy.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.000]   Mom has a job with that.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.280]   He's a cryptic man.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.480]   Now, that's not fake news.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.160]   I can't get the cryptid for Montana,
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.880]   is what you're like, big foot?
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.000]   I trust Carson's mom.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.080]   My mom was an auditor for the--
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.120]   Oh, stop now, Carson.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.200]   You want to state government?
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.440]   You're digging deeper and deeper in this.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:41.960]   Yes, there's--
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:51.320]   Marianne Williamson is yellow, which means she's not
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.880]   rejecting spoofed emails, but she's using DMARC.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:58.040]   John Delaney, Tom Steyer, Donald J. Trump,
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.800]   Deval Patrick and Bernie Sanders are all yellow.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.400]   Red is bad.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.400]   Red is not using DMARC at all.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:08.600]   That's oddly enough, Yang, who is--
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.480]   Yeah, that was the broadest.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:11.760]   The technocrat, right?
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.520]   He's the guy who wants to give us all $1,000.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.480]   This is all just DMARC.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.320]   You could remember that.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:16.160]   Maybe other--
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.000]   There's lots of--
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.400]   This is why I don't like this story.
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:22.080]   I feel like this is A, giving too much weight
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.360]   to the value of DMARC and B, is ignoring
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.800]   there are other solutions.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.280]   Giving too much value to email, because they really shouldn't
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.280]   be using--
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:30.760]   They shouldn't be using email at all.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:32.640]   If they should be using signal for--
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:35.880]   Yeah, Pete Buttigieg, also a technocrat not using it.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.520]   Michael Bennett--
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:37.120]   Hey, respect.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.200]   You want us to pronounce his name?
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.880]   I've never been able to do that.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.880]   I practice.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.480]   OK.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.200]   It's easy.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:45.760]   Buttigieg, just like it's spelled.
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:50.000]   So there's a wonderful clip of a British--
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.400]   a Welsh weather forecaster.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.280]   And he pronounces the whole--
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:57.120]   the landfurb, the longest-name meeting.
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:00.480]   And he does it all with absolute ease, just like--
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.480]   But it takes him half an hour.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.360]   That's the amazing--
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.400]   And about half a pound of flair, but yes.
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:10.760]   Joe Walsh, I didn't know Joe was running for a president.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:13.960]   And is that not the same Joe Walsh as the Eagles, Joe Walsh?
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:14.800]   No, it is not.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.300]   OK.
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:15.960]   I wish it were.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:18.200]   And Joe says, "stack."
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:18.800]   I don't--
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.080]   I think-- so when Lisa said this, I said, well, yeah,
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.600]   I don't think this means that they're like dumb,
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.000]   or they're insecure.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.200]   There are other ways to spot fishing emails than D-mark.
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.040]   And while it'd be nice to use--
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.400]   you want every string on your bow.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.400]   If it's conflicting with some other security software,
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:35.840]   they've got--
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.920]   I can understand why they don't use it.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:40.000]   His point-- and it is well taken--
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.040]   Zach says is that the hack of the DNC
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.240]   happened because it was a spearfishing attack.
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:47.920]   So it was spoofed email.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.600]   And that would have been blocked.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.040]   And there were conversations that the DNC was having over email
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.520]   that they should have never had over email.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.840]   That's where they should have turned a signal.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.840]   Or not even-- that usually will put that kind of stuff
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:58.280]   in text.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:01.880]   Although this raises a question about tech literacy, tech
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:06.400]   tools, and when a cohort starts--
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.720]   what level of tech literacy a cohort grows up with?
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.600]   Because I would--
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.400]   Bernie's got-- I know with an art company,
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.960]   there was a whole lot of conversations.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.120]   People would go down a path, and we'd be like, yeah,
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:16.920]   and take that off.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:17.920]   Just take that.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.920]   Just don't write that.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.920]   Don't put that in.
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.040]   Don't like whatever.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.080]   And it just immediately do not put that in text.
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.080]   I don't want it in Slack.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.440]   I don't want it in messages.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.960]   I don't want it in anything.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.200]   Don't say those things.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.800]   There are things that you say in person.
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.320]   And I think that people--
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:35.760]   I think a lot of people get very comfortable with these things
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.440]   to say a lot of things.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.800]   That's what I wanted to say.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.760]   You never put anything online and email, whatever,
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:41.600]   that you couldn't shift.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.720]   It depended on your local newspaper.
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:44.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:46.520]   So while it is true that that would
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.880]   have prevented the spoofing that got John Podesta
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.000]   in trouble, got the DNC hack, who knows what other things
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:52.560]   they're doing.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:55.360]   They may be doing things that are equally effective.
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.640]   And probably they shouldn't be--
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:59.200]   They shouldn't have been doing what they were talking about,
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:43:59.680]   either.
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.800]   You don't like being able to do what they were talking about
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:02.600]   doing.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.600]   So there's that.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.280]   And then they shouldn't have been in the email
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.120]   in the first place.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:06.680]   They've been talking about it.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.120]   And then they should have tied it up.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.520]   But the point I'm trying to make, though,
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.520]   is that how great would have been if Joe Walsh actually
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:14.200]   ran for president?
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.680]   Rocky Mountain High Joe Walsh.
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.120]   Yeah, like little legals.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:18.880]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:19.760]   Have you ever seen--
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.760]   Have you seen that?
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.160]   Have you seen the four-hour Eagles documentary?
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:23.640]   No.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.560]   Yeah, it was amazing.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.400]   Yes, exactly.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:25.920]   Is it good?
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:26.920]   All is it?
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.880]   It's a four-long documentary.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.960]   It's more because of the Irishman.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:33.520]   First quote from Joe Walsh, like, if you wanted to make somebody--
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.680]   if you wanted to permanently break an AI,
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.720]   just ask them to dissect his sentences.
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.000]   It's wonderful.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.200]   He's a ham, by the way.
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.480]   And it's been on our "Hamb Nation Show" many times.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:46.320]   A philosopher once said-- and he goes for five minutes.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.160]   And by the end of it, I was like, it was a ride.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.840]   And the whole documentary is just him.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:52.680]   It's glorious.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.160]   Check that out.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.880]   We started the show with outrage over.org.
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:01.160]   We're going to end with outrage over.gov, a different.gov.gov.ca.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.920]   I'll talk about it in just a second.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:09.120]   But first a word from Wasabi, our sponsor, Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.600]   80% of enterprises in the next five years
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.760]   will have shut down their on-prem and replaced it with cloud.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.000]   And probably you're working for one of those companies.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.840]   Maybe your company is one of those companies.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.680]   And I know the first question everybody says,
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:26.960]   well, is it going to be as useful as secure as reliable
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.560]   as my on-premises storage?
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.680]   Well, I've got the answer for you, Wasabi.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.280]   It is.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.400]   It's going to be more secure than your on-premise storage,
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.040]   more reliable, more robust.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.320]   Wait, you say, is Wasabi Amazon no?
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.480]   Is it Google no?
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.080]   Is it Microsoft no?
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:47.200]   It is another cloud service that I want you to add to your list.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:50.440]   There's lots of good reasons to take a look at Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.880]   It is 80% cheaper and up to six times faster than Amazon S3.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.560]   Unlike S3, they don't charge you for egress.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.360]   Unlike S3, they don't charge you for API requests.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.800]   And oh, by the way, they support the S3 API.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.120]   So you already have tools and know how to use it.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.040]   It's enterprise class cloud storage with 11.9s of durability.
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:15.320]   One of the things I love about this, they have immutable storage.
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:18.840]   That is really useful because you know you could put something
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.400]   on the Wasabi cloud and that ransomware can't get to it,
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.440]   a fumble-fingered employee can't get to it.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.200]   You can't change it.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:29.080]   You can get to it, but you just can't change it.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.720]   That means you're safe from ransomware.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:34.200]   They also have, of course, data center redundancy
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:37.960]   and regular file integrity checking.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:41.880]   So if a file is changed by even one bit,
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:44.040]   they can immediately replace it with a good copy.
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:45.920]   You'll never even see it.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.120]   We're talking the software and hardware combined
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:54.600]   that is more secure than on-prem storage, more reliable.
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.840]   It's HIPAA compliant, it's FINRA compliant,
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.600]   it's CJIS compliant.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.000]   Instead of giving you more headaches,
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.200]   you're gonna have fewer headaches
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.720]   and you're gonna do it for less with Wasabi.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.520]   I just want you to try it.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.360]   I just want you to try.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.000]   I was talking to somebody yesterday.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.320]   We all got together after Steve's of any.
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.280]   He said, "Yeah, well, but nobody ever get fired
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.400]   "for buying Amazon."
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.880]   Just like nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.480]   But nowadays, it's a competitive environment.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.080]   That default answer isn't the right answer.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.160]   You need to check out Wasabi.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.840]   A lot of great companies have already moved to Wasabi.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.960]   You should go to wasabi.com, use the offer code TWIT
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:33.080]   and you can have unlimited free storage for a month.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.240]   And I mean, bang on that sucker.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:38.040]   Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I.com.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:40.920]   Click the free trial link out of the promo code TWIT.
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.680]   Cut your cloud storage costs by 80%
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.040]   without giving up anything.
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.360]   In fact, you're gonna get quite a few things.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.260]   Wasabi.
[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:52.520]   This one actually,
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.160]   this story penetrated to the real world.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.800]   My brother-in-law said,
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.640]   I heard that California's DMV is selling our information.
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.720]   And they are to the tune of $50 million a year.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.360]   Now you may say, well, I don't live in California,
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.440]   but apparently many departments of motor vehicle
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.520]   are doing this.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.280]   I was gonna say, if they're doing this in California,
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:19.360]   imagine what they're doing in sort of Maine over month.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.800]   And this is information you're required to provide
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:22.640]   to get a license.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:23.600]   It's not like you have a choice,
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.520]   including names, physical address,
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.660]   car registration information.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:31.040]   The motherboard found this out.
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:33.600]   They did a public records request.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.860]   They asked the DMV for the total dollar amounts
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:37.980]   paid by commercial requesters of data
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:40.080]   for the past six years.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.480]   And it started at 2013 to 41 million,
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.680]   climbed up to 52 million last year.
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.280]   They didn't get the names of the requesters.
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:51.720]   But some companies, motherboards,
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:55.080]   says appeared frequently in an earlier investigation
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.240]   that looked at DMV's across the country.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:01.120]   They include Lexus Nexus, Experian,
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.800]   the credit reporting agency.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:06.320]   And private investigators.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.320]   - Well, there are the full photos.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.760]   - So I'm on the DMV website right now.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:12.280]   On a page titled, "How Information is Protected
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.960]   or Disclosed."
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.760]   And the opening line is,
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:18.160]   "When the DMV collects personal information from you,
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:22.800]   state law, civil code section 1798.17 requires the DMV
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.080]   to notify you about the principal purposes
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.880]   for which the information is to be used.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:29.160]   And any known or foreseeable disclosures,
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.480]   which may be made of information collected
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.400]   where the disclosure of such information
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.560]   to a government entity is necessary."
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.840]   - Government entity, they've mentioned third parties,
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:39.200]   commercial parties. - Exactly, yeah.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:41.280]   And that's--
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.800]   - California's public-- - That's a whole lot of latitude.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.400]   - Yeah, California's public information officer said,
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:49.640]   "The sale of this data furthers objectives related
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.120]   to highway and public safety."
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.720]   - In other words, we get money from it.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.520]   - Including availability of insurance, risk assessment.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:56.360]   That's fine.
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:57.440]   Of course, insurance companies probably
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.920]   should get this information, right?
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.440]   Vehicle safety recalls.
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:03.080]   Okay, Ford, if they wanna recall a Ford vehicle,
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.080]   should be able to go to the DMV,
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:05.720]   so it's who owns this vehicle.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.120]   Although you think Ford might know that.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:08.600]   - I have the records for that already.
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.520]   - Traffic studies, emissions research.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:14.960]   Oh, and then he throws it at the end, background checks.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.720]   And for pre and existing employment purposes,
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:21.480]   the DMV takes its obligation to protect personal information
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:22.480]   very seriously.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:23.600]   - That's the minute you hear somebody,
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.960]   oh, I take this very seriously.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:25.960]   - Very seriously.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.040]   This is my favorite phrase.
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:32.120]   "It's only released pursuant to legislative direction."
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:33.480]   That's kind of the equivalent of--
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.600]   - That sounds like passing the buck a little more.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:35.640]   - I didn't do it. - Yeah.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:37.040]   - They told us to do it.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:37.880]   - I'm sure it's part of the--
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:38.960]   - It's only a bank orders.
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:40.040]   It's part of the budget.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.320]   - It's probably part of the budget.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:43.640]   - I mean, the only way to fix this is a referendum.
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:45.280]   - Multiple other DMV's around the US
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.680]   previously confirmed to motherboard,
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.080]   they have cut off data access
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.560]   for some commercial requesters
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.560]   after they abused the data.
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:52.680]   - That's a really clever quote,
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.040]   because what they're effectively saying
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:55.520]   is if you don't like it, take it up with your legacy.
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:56.440]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.280]   - It's not us.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:58.120]   - Yeah.
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:58.960]   - Tell the assembly.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:00.800]   - But you see, we've had this before with,
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:02.680]   you know, with the mobile phone companies
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.960]   selling off location data,
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:06.320]   again, primarily to private investigators.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.680]   They did this, the press caught them at it.
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.640]   They said, well, we'll think very carefully
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:13.560]   about not doing that again by the certain date.
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.160]   They checked again six months later,
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.440]   they're still doing it.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:19.800]   And the FCC is just going, well, it's not really our issue
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.240]   and it doesn't make them a lot of money.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.840]   So you can see quite about it.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:26.280]   - Completely illegal in California
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:30.120]   because of DPPA, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:31.560]   That happened in 1994.
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:32.400]   I don't know if you remember this,
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:33.840]   I do vividly.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:36.080]   Starlet, Rebecca Schafer,
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:39.920]   a Stalker hired a private investigator
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.320]   to get her home address.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:45.480]   He got it from the DMV, the Stalker killed Schafer.
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.560]   And this act was passed to prevent that
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.800]   from ever happening again.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.160]   - Yeah, he killed her five years earlier.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:52.440]   It took five years from the Decraft legislation to address.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:55.280]   - Oh, so he killed her in early in late years.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:57.040]   - He killed her in 1989.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.600]   - Oh, man.
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:01.360]   - And it took five years for people to finally be like,
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.200]   oh, maybe you shouldn't be able to just get rid
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.040]   and people, right?
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:06.200]   - And it took less than a few years
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:08.120]   for the DMV to ignore that law
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:09.560]   because I guess there were enough loopholes
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:10.560]   that they were able to do so.
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.200]   Anyway, something to be aware of.
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:13.520]   - It is lucrative.
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:15.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.000]   Well, I mean, some students saying that if you want
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.640]   to buy a TV that doesn't harvest your day
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:21.760]   so in the future, you're going to have to pay more for it.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.600]   - Yeah.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.320]   - You know, it's just,
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.640]   yeah, we make it a notch.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:28.760]   - This is the last CES I had to go to,
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.880]   the thing that had me just reeling the whole way through
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.280]   and on the way home is I kept going
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.360]   to all the different smart kitchens
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.720]   and I'd have my interviews and my demos
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.000]   and then I would ask,
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.960]   so what is your data privacy policy?
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.760]   Do you disclose the data that you're collecting
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.720]   from the smart fridges and the smart ovens?
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.960]   How is it being stored?
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.560]   How is it being sold?
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.280]   Do I as a user have the option to edit data?
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:54.120]   And consistently, the answer from vendors was,
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:56.000]   no, you never get to see what we're collecting.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.680]   You have no say in this.
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:00.480]   We're not going to even tell you how it's stored
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.520]   or what the security protocols are for it
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.160]   or who we're selling this data to.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:08.560]   And it's, I remain sort of astonished
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:11.800]   that this is bog standard with doing business
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:14.680]   as opposed to there being a level of transparency saying,
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:16.320]   the good news is you have a smart refrigerator
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:18.120]   that tells you when to buy milk.
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.840]   That smart refrigerator is also logging
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.080]   how often you drink milk.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:23.120]   It's going to, it's going to co-late you
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.240]   in the database of other milk drinkers in the US.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.200]   We're going to bundle that up.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.760]   We're going to sell it to the National Dairy Board.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:28.840]   We're going to sell it to Borden.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.320]   We're going to sell it to...
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:34.600]   - And I have limited concern when it's anonymized.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.200]   You know, like if it's truly anonymized
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.880]   and that data is being used locally for me
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:40.040]   to have something... - For traffic control.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.240]   - Or to know or to just know what,
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:45.800]   you know, know what the flow of milk is in a certain area.
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:48.560]   If it's anonymized and it's not geographically specific,
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.760]   you know, I think that there are a lot of interesting things
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:52.920]   that can be derived from that.
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:56.360]   That is not damaging me in any real way.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.600]   But I think, I do think that the idea that it,
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.840]   that you can build a map of somebody
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:04.000]   based on all of the things, the hard part,
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.520]   we can't get this discussion.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:08.000]   My security concerns about, you know,
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.440]   about people messing with my phone.
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:11.280]   You know, I don't really like, I don't even let,
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:13.480]   I don't even take my iPhones to Apple to fix.
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:15.360]   You know, I didn't, I don't know if I said that on the show,
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.440]   but I've never actually taken,
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:19.680]   if my phone breaks, I just buy a new phone.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.600]   Like I'm not going to, you know,
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.160]   I'm not going to give it to anybody.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.640]   And the reason why you destroy it though,
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.800]   in a way that nobody can get the data off of the,
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:27.800]   I was still sitting in my house.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.960]   I got to mind you that.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.920]   I have to, by the way, it's a huge concern.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:33.280]   I mean, we, I don't, I didn't, I didn't ask a vote
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:34.760]   on this based on a DEF CON talk.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.680]   It is surprisingly hard to destroy all the data
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:38.800]   and it'll be readable.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.480]   'Cause their, their premise was,
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:41.680]   if you're running a data center
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:44.680]   and a three, three data agency knocks down the door,
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.560]   is it possible to destroy that data really quickly?
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:50.000]   And even using thermite and various other things,
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.320]   it really isn't.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:53.880]   You know, if you've got a phone that you don't want anyone
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.400]   to hide again, you take the membership out
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.720]   and this is their advice, you beat them to death
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.640]   with a hammer and then you deposit them
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:03.320]   in various different bins in the house
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:04.320]   so no one's got them all.
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.720]   We put it in the microwave.
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:06.840]   Is that good enough?
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:07.680]   No.
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:08.800]   And drill the holes in it.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.800]   We, we, yeah, I knew it.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.720]   An agency that drills holes hammer, hits them with a hammer,
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:17.280]   applies high heat and then keeps them in the, in the,
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.280]   in the cellar.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:19.960]   You know, like, like that's the, you know,
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:21.080]   they don't actually leave.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.840]   They just, they're mostly inert, you know, and,
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.640]   but so the thing that I, and I, my argument is,
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.720]   is that your phone is probably the most powerful
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:32.400]   and dangerous thing that you carry around
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:35.000]   and letting people randomly get ahold of it.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.280]   And so in the same way, because people,
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.400]   once they see your phone, once someone actually has all
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.160]   the data in the phone, they can not only look
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:43.480]   at what you did in the past, but they can start modeling
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:44.720]   what you're going to do in the future.
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:48.000]   And that becomes a very complicated, you know, process.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.840]   I love our audience in the chatroom buzz as well.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:53.680]   It's very simple.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.080]   You put them in a firmness furnace,
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:57.880]   bring it to the eutetic point and it just blows us a slide.
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:58.960]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:00.240]   Of course, all of our furnaces.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:02.120]   Yes, just bring it to the eutetic point
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:02.960]   and dispose of the slide.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:03.960]   So, but like, but, but, but, but,
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:08.760]   I have a lot of, you know, a variety of, of TVs
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.000]   that will connect to the internet
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.680]   and none of them are allowed to connect to the internet.
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:13.800]   None of them, you know, I, my Apple TV connects
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.280]   to the internet and that is the one point of access
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.320]   to the rest, the outside world when it comes to entertainment.
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:21.160]   Mostly because I trust Apple more than everyone else.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.360]   I don't think that they're perfect,
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.360]   but I trust them more than I trust everybody else
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.760]   as far as my data.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.200]   So, Tim Berners-Lee,
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.240]   creator of the World Wide Web.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:35.880]   I feel like Tim wants the world to be a better place,
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:37.640]   but Tim is having a little bit of trouble,
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:40.360]   I think, figuring out how to do it.
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.840]   For a while, wasn't he, didn't he have a new company
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:45.600]   that had something to do with your control, your own data?
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.480]   I don't know what's happened to that.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.360]   Now, he's unveiled a global plan to save the web,
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.120]   that's the headline in the Guardian.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.880]   - Yep.
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.320]   - Yeah. - You picked a horrible microphone.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.640]   You, you look at that, that's it?
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.960]   - I don't blame him for the microphone, he didn't forget it.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:00.880]   - I'm wrong with the microphone.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.680]   - Whoever handed it to him, you're fired.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:07.320]   - The contract for the web requires endorsing governments,
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.280]   companies and individuals to make concrete commitments
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:13.240]   to protect the web from abuse,
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:15.480]   which is not the most concrete term.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:20.480]   And ensure it benefits humanity, which is even less concrete.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:22.120]   - Oh, you see, I mean, I love--
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.200]   - You know, you do a command F
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.880]   and there's no enforcement anywhere in the story,
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:28.640]   so anyone can sign a contract for anything.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.440]   - He's 150 organizations have signed this, Microsoft,
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.240]   Twitter, Google and Facebook.
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:35.080]   - Good, good, easy.
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:35.920]   - 'Cause why not?
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:37.960]   - Well yeah, I was gonna say, because if you read through it,
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:41.000]   it's so full of loopholes that you could drive trucks
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:41.840]   through them.
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:44.200]   - The funniest thing is Amazon has not signed it,
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.360]   which really makes you wonder, like, what are they planning?
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:48.400]   How bad?
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.640]   Or maybe Jeff said, I don't, I don't, I don't.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:54.680]   - I think you just looked at it, this is stupid.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.520]   - This is stupid.
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.880]   - Yeah, no, I mean, it's, I have to say about once a month,
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:02.680]   I'll come across something on the web and just makes me think,
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:05.080]   do you think Tim Berners-Lee saw this?
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.240]   He'd just sit in a darkened room for a while
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:09.000]   and just go, what have I done?
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.080]   - Yeah.
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:13.440]   - I mean, I'll sign it, and everybody should sign it.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:15.640]   - Well yeah, I don't think everybody's signing it,
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.640]   and enforcing it, and you know.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:20.320]   - Well there's no, this is not, yeah.
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:22.400]   - So it's a nice PR friendly exercise,
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:23.680]   and everyone feels happy off it.
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.880]   - I don't feel like, Tim is a PR-focused fly.
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.280]   - I think he's genuinely serious,
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:32.880]   and he would love companies to take this up and fight for it.
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:35.720]   I think as we've seen with the case of Apple, Google,
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.960]   Facebook, any technology company,
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:41.120]   if it comes to making, you know, fighting for rights like this,
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:45.280]   or making a profit, then not only will they choose profit,
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:47.440]   naturally, they're legally obliged to.
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:48.280]   - Yes.
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.040]   - So, you know, it's--
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:51.960]   - Any publicly held company,
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:53.840]   the officers of this company are sworn
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:55.160]   to uphold shareholder value.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:56.400]   - Right, yeah.
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.960]   And it's, I don't know about any office
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.120]   who's making a big move against this and the rest of it,
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.440]   but that's cute.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:05.480]   But you know, it's until you fundamentally change the system,
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:06.480]   I don't see that changing.
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:08.080]   - Well it's a lot of posturing,
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:09.720]   'cause you can feel good about signing it,
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:12.280]   and then you go to some event where there's the,
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:13.880]   there's always that loop of video
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.480]   that plays the "Bigambit Event" where you hear
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:16.840]   the really uplifting music,
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.560]   and then there's a child holding a tablet
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:21.880]   while the music swells, and there's some vagary about--
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:22.720]   - Yeah.
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:23.720]   - Distributing opportunities and making the world
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:24.720]   a better place.
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:26.040]   - And then they never actually show you the child
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.560]   making the tablet in the sweatshop
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:28.400]   with the burning things,
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:31.320]   so one fumes around them, but you know, it's just--
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:32.160]   - But the big thing--
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:34.000]   - And some CEO will come out and be like,
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.520]   "And we're so committed to making sure that we're not part
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:40.400]   of the problem, we've signed this contract,
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.320]   and that'll be the end of it."
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:43.880]   They won't, there's not gonna be any action
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:44.720]   that comes from this.
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:47.160]   - So Microsoft has announced what the next update
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:48.080]   to Windows will be.
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.720]   You know, in the past they've had a year in a month,
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:55.040]   so we had 1903, which was supposedly released in March
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.320]   of 2019, actually it was May, but you close enough.
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:02.200]   Then we had, we just got 1909, again released in October,
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.920]   but it was supposed to be September.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.280]   And so the problem is that this first release
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:14.200]   of the year 2020 is gonna be called
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:16.840]   Microsoft Windows 10 2003.
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:18.680]   (laughs)
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:21.480]   And that's a problem, especially since there's already
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:24.920]   a Windows Server 2003, but there's always a problem.
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:27.040]   So Microsoft's way, they fixed it.
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:29.720]   You'll be glad to hear it, they're gonna call it 2004.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:32.320]   - Oh good, that's not confusing at all.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:34.560]   (laughs)
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:37.760]   We were lobbying for something like 20H1,
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:38.920]   which is his code name.
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.280]   - Yeah, that's the shit God wants.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:41.680]   - I wouldn't go with that one, so.
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.480]   - Well, they're still sort of good.
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:44.680]   When they announced they were going straight
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:46.040]   to Windows 10, it was like,
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:47.840]   why was that and it really came back with,
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.600]   well, because 789, and it was like, okay.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.680]   - Oh, they didn't really say that, did they?
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:53.720]   - No, no, this was a read-out though, I was.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:57.200]   - When I was at info, one of the April Fool stories
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:59.280]   that we ran in when year was Microsoft
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.360]   just announced they're skipping Windows 9
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.000]   'cause they're so embarrassed by Windows.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.600]   - That might've been true.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.440]   - And then they did that.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:08.440]   - That might've been actually accurate.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:12.320]   We are coming up against a hard deadline for Windows 7.
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:14.280]   They're not gonna support it after January 14.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.880]   - Well, unless you pay them a large amount of money.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:16.720]   But yeah.
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:17.560]   - But you know what I'm reading,
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:18.400]   and a lot of places. - It's like a couple of things
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.240]   with it.
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:20.080]   - Well, that's what I'm--
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:21.800]   - Well, you can actually apply for an extra year.
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:23.120]   If you're an enterprise customer,
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:24.200]   you can apply for an extra year.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:25.280]   - But it costs you.
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:27.080]   - No, this is free of charge, apparently.
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:28.240]   But only for one year.
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:30.160]   - And then the next year, then those costs you.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:32.800]   - Oh, it's gonna cost you an odd leg on your first board.
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:33.640]   - Yeah.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:34.600]   - So there seems to be a loophole.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:39.000]   And Paul and Mary Jo and I have been kind of speculating
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.280]   about this on Windows Weekly for some time.
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:43.000]   We keep hearing reports that, well,
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.200]   remember when Microsoft came out with Windows 10?
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:48.080]   You could for the first year just install it on top of 7,
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.200]   and it would activate, and it'd be fine.
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.520]   Seems like it still works.
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:56.600]   And there was a post on Reddit the other day by Microsofty.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.240]   He says, "I work in the Windows team."
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:01.760]   And yeah, Microsoft doesn't wanna talk about it.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:03.920]   But Terry Meierson, who runs Windows,
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:06.160]   was actually more interested in upgrade numbers
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.800]   than revenue since they've really given up
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:09.480]   on revenue from Windows.
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:12.040]   So he'd much more rather have to be able to say,
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:15.120]   90% of our users are now on Windows 10.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:15.960]   So.
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:17.480]   - Interesting, I've got no Windows 8 machine
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:18.920]   knocking around, I could give that a shot.
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:21.960]   - So the story goes, if you go to the Microsoft site,
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.880]   download the Windows Media Creation Tool with Windows 10,
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:28.760]   you pretty soon you'll be able to get the 2004 edition.
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:32.440]   And install it on top of Windows 7,
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.320]   no serial number night needed,
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.560]   it will install and activate.
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.200]   And at that point, of course, you have an entitlement,
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.840]   and then you could wipe the drive if you wanted it,
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:42.280]   wouldn't matter, you can install it as 10, whatever you want.
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.640]   So I just mentioned that in passing.
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:46.640]   Remember, if you do it, it's not my fault.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:48.840]   If it fails, it doesn't activate,
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:51.080]   and you say, "But Leo, I want my Windows 7."
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:53.560]   - Like you said, they don't really...
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:54.880]   - What do they care?
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:58.680]   - They're, you know, their revenue goes into three buckets.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.120]   They have one bucket that's essentially the Azure and Cloud.
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:04.720]   They have one called Productivity,
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:06.040]   I can't remember the name off the top of my head,
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:08.840]   but that's where they're putting Office 365,
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:11.320]   now Microsoft 365 really is subscription service.
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:13.400]   And the last bucket is more personal computing,
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.640]   which is where their revenue from OEMs, from Surface,
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:20.720]   from Bing bizarrely enough, and from...
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:21.920]   - This way, claim to base.
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:24.640]   - And from Windows, actually Bing is like a $5 billion
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:25.480]   in your business.
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:26.320]   - Really?
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.160]   - Yes, they've actually...
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.520]   - Oh, I stand corrected, right.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:31.680]   - They make a lot of money, and they've had, I think,
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:34.920]   close to 19 quarters of consecutive revenue growth.
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:37.480]   - Do they still roll Xbox revenue into Bing, though?
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:38.960]   - No, they had this put out.
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:41.560]   I actually have a spreadsheet where I keep track of this stuff.
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:42.960]   - You pay attention to this stuff.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:46.400]   - But what's notable is that typically more personal
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.480]   computing was the big revenue driver
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:52.920]   for Microsoft every quarter, and now the Azure division
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:55.360]   is making as much money as more personal computing does,
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.880]   and it shows that Microsoft's been really successful.
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:00.920]   In shifting, it's...
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.560]   In shifting its business focus away from the end user
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.280]   and more towards distributed cloud services.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:07.120]   - It's all about Azure.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:07.960]   - It's called the services.
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:08.880]   - All about Azure, maybe.
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:11.320]   - And when I was at Ignite a few weeks ago,
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:13.440]   and we were at the keynote,
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:16.680]   Satya Nadella did not mention Windows once in that keynote.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.600]   - Isn't that amazing?
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:18.520]   - Not once.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:19.520]   - What a change.
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:21.520]   - Yeah, over the course of five years.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.360]   - It's an early year. - It's an early year.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.840]   - In Windows 10.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.760]   - Yeah, so at this point,
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:28.440]   like the, so I wholly buy into the idea
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:30.720]   that they're more about the conversion step
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:31.560]   than they are about revenue.
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:33.280]   - To be clear, Terry left a year ago,
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:36.120]   but I think that this was a policy
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:37.440]   and they just, either they forgot
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:38.800]   and just haven't changed it,
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:41.920]   or I don't know, it's the Terry Meyerson Memorial Project,
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:42.920]   I don't know.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:45.040]   But so it's worth a try if you're worried.
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:46.720]   I know a lot of people just wish they could stay
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:50.120]   with Windows 7, but that seems to be ill advised.
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:53.120]   - All these worms and everything else.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:54.480]   It's worth upgrading.
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:56.080]   - Yeah, moving forward.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:58.640]   - I will always love DOS 5,
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:00.920]   but I can't continue to use that.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:02.640]   - I do miss DOS 5.
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:04.320]   - When I talk to people at Ignite,
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.760]   the biggest reason people don't upgrade
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:07.360]   is they're working for school systems
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:09.600]   or they're working for small municipal governments
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:12.560]   and their IT budgets aren't there.
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:16.160]   And that is something that I wish more tech companies,
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.320]   'cause they aggressively court these customers once
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:21.080]   and then expect them to act like corporate customers
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.080]   who have a big IT budget,
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:24.360]   and that's not gonna be the case
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:26.840]   if you're funded off of taxpayer money.
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:28.840]   - And a lot of times they had a consultant come in,
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:31.000]   install everything, and they're no longer there.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.560]   They don't have the technical wherewithal to do.
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:35.400]   - There's also a lot of medical gear,
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:38.600]   like X-ray machines that are built on XP
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:40.320]   and can't be updated.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:41.160]   - Yeah.
[02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:42.000]   - That's what you think the difference is.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.280]   - Why they're connected to the internet
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.680]   is another question.
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:45.520]   - Yeah.
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:47.160]   - You know, maybe that'll be when you'd wanna air gap.
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:48.880]   - We had a motion control camera
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:51.040]   that we used to use at ILM
[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:54.520]   that literally still used a 3.5 inch disk.
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:55.360]   - Floppy.
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:56.200]   - Floppy.
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:58.280]   - And there was like one floppy
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:05:59.960]   and it was like, it had all these dark fingerprints
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:00.800]   all over it.
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:03.640]   - You'd move it, 'cause you would be calculating
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:07.040]   the movement in Maya,
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:08.440]   and then you'd export out that date,
[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.000]   you'd push it and export the data,
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.800]   and then you'd put it on this little,
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:14.200]   yeah, and then you'd go ahead
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:15.200]   and put it into the motion control.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.560]   - Yeah, I mean, the British thinkaly defense,
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.920]   the Trident submarine fleet,
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:19.600]   runs on a version of Windows XP,
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:20.880]   which they're still having to pay
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.120]   microsoft of support.
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:23.560]   - 'Cause there's no choice?
[02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:24.400]   - No.
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:26.600]   - I mean, it's an industrial control system at this point.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.600]   - So don't hunt nukes running like Fortran
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:29.440]   or something like that.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:30.360]   I mean, I think it's like,
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:32.040]   they're something way back.
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:33.200]   - So, big question.
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:34.840]   - Which is, if they even work in the first place.
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:35.760]   - Right, right.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:36.600]   - You know, it's.
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:37.440]   - We have absolute,
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.760]   according to Kieran McCarthy again at the Reg.
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:40.600]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:42.520]   - We have run out of IP addresses.
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:44.280]   I know, sounds like a false alarm.
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.880]   We mentioned this for years ago.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.320]   - We were arguing about this in the office
[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:48.440]   before this article was written.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:49.360]   It was just like, well, hang on,
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.840]   we did that one before, didn't we?
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:54.720]   It's like, yeah, 2017, 2015 and 2004.
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.000]   But this time, they--
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.440]   - Really, this time we've really, really--
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:06:59.920]   - Yeah, we are. - This is from Ripe.
[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:03.320]   The European Regional Internet Registry,
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:05.080]   they announced on Monday,
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:09.720]   we have made our final stroke 22 IPv4 allocation
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:12.680]   from the last remaining addresses in our pool.
[02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:14.160]   Now, there are other pools.
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:16.400]   Stanford has like a slash eight.
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:17.920]   I mean, there's the IP--
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:21.200]   - There is a gray market in IPv4 addresses,
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:23.360]   and there will be a salvage market in companies
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:25.480]   that go bust and getting hold of their address stacks
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:26.840]   and selling them on.
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:30.280]   But you gotta say, we shouldn't be in this situation.
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:31.800]   - We should be in IPv6.
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:33.080]   - We should be in IPv6.
[02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:35.720]   Unfortunately, certain design decisions with IPv6
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:37.840]   were made regarding compatibility,
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:40.120]   which have really quid the market to them.
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:44.040]   So it's just that we're still at this situation
[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:46.200]   is incredibly frustrating.
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:48.160]   But apparently, yeah, it's time has come.
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.360]   And if you wanna buy one now,
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.760]   gotta go on the gray market.
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:52.160]   - Wow.
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.120]   - End of an era, right?
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:55.120]   - Yeah, I guess.
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:56.120]   Maybe not the end.
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:57.480]   Is it the end?
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:58.800]   - They're gonna hang on like--
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:01.080]   - Is this more like the Elton John farewell tour?
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:02.640]   I mean, it could go on for years.
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:03.760]   - No, I mean, they're gonna hang around
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:05.040]   like a far less space suit.
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:07.040]   But I mean, they're still gonna be there,
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:09.840]   but they should be replaced as soon as it's humanly possible.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:11.880]   But there's no pressing economic reason
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:13.320]   for many companies to do so.
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:15.400]   - So I was in Dubai a couple of weeks ago,
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:18.880]   and it's amazing how much money they spend on for quality.
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:22.720]   The Dubai police force says they're going to add
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:26.120]   the cyber truck to their police vehicles.
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:26.960]   By the way, they have--
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:28.160]   - It does look like it.
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:29.000]   - It looks good.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.520]   It looks great for a police car.
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:33.200]   - They have an ISO when I was there.
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:35.600]   - They have Ferraris, they have Mercedes.
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:37.480]   - Yeah, they have all sorts of--
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:38.800]   - It's beautiful cars.
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:40.600]   - They have fun being a police traffic cop over there.
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:44.440]   - They have Bugatti Veron's, Ferrari FFs.
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:46.120]   - You need those to catch up with some of the folks
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:47.040]   that might be speeding.
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.440]   - Oh yeah.
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:50.160]   I have to say, I looked at the cyber truck,
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:53.400]   and I don't wanna see this coming down on Dark Alley though.
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.440]   That's scary.
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:57.520]   - Although if you have a heavy ball bearing,
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.600]   you just throw it at the window.
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:01.960]   - I don't know, they announced the reason for that.
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:03.400]   - Oh, that's BS.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.320]   - Yeah, that's a BS, but--
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:07.640]   - They said it's 'cause the Sledgehammer weakened it.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:08.480]   - Yeah.
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:09.800]   - Except they didn't hit the back door with it.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:12.280]   - They caused an invisible crack in the window,
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:13.400]   which then weakened it.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:16.040]   - But what about the back window?
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:16.880]   - Yeah.
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:17.880]   - They didn't Sledgehammer that door.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:19.440]   - I looked at that car.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.040]   You look at the design of it,
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:23.960]   and I just thought that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:24.800]   That is a--
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:25.640]   - It's kind of a--
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:28.000]   - Almost designed to kill pedestrians if you hit them.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:28.840]   - Oh yeah.
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:30.480]   - And also the rigid shell,
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:31.840]   - It's a true affair.
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:34.040]   - A swoopy-dewby design of the Volvo
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:37.000]   is not less likely to kill a pedestrian
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:37.840]   if you hit them.
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:39.400]   - I mean, the thing is, Volvo is another car.
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:41.240]   Over the last quarter of a century,
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:43.600]   we're building cars with crumpled zones
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:46.280]   because they protect both the pedestrians and the drivers.
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:48.000]   - This was something hard-ridded.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.640]   - Yeah, now I'm sure they've loaded up the inside
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:52.800]   with airbags so the driver's safe,
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:55.960]   but anything you hit is gonna get absolutely creamed.
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:00.040]   - I, yeah, I don't know what to say.
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.160]   - That said it does look--
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.000]   - I buy one if I--
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.640]   - I was gonna say, part of me looked at it and it was like,
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:04.480]   God.
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:05.320]   - I still want one.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:08.480]   - It's the Hummer of the 21st century.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:10.480]   - Except it's electric.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:11.320]   - So it's good for the world.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:12.400]   - Exactly, it's not eight miles to the gallon.
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:13.240]   - Yeah.
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:15.920]   - Yeah, but it still, it just screams,
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:18.000]   I'm concerned about the size of my genitalia.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.600]   It just, you know, it's--
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.160]   - I'm not concerned, I want it.
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:23.080]   (laughs)
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:24.080]   - Oh, it'd be fun.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.680]   - Again, I really feel like we should be working more
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:29.920]   towards pedestrian safety or bike safety
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:31.960]   or something along these lines.
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:33.400]   And I'd like to see a tech company
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:34.680]   actually addressing that as opposed to,
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:36.880]   look, it's a car that's been made out of polygons.
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:37.720]   - I think we know.
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:38.960]   - I think we get cars out of cities
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:40.120]   and then it'd be much better.
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:40.960]   - Yeah, I agree, yeah.
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:42.160]   No more cars in cities.
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:45.120]   Finally, Black Friday, day before yesterday.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:48.880]   Adobe keeps track of all this stuff.
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:54.920]   It is a record, Black Friday, a new high--
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:56.320]   - 7.4 billion.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:01.320]   - 7.4 billion online.
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:03.320]   This is not brick and mortar.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:04.560]   - I bought some eggs.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:05.400]   - Online?
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:06.600]   You bought eggs online?
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:08.760]   - No, no, I went and bought them.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.600]   That was my entire Friday,
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:12.080]   Friday, the Black Friday experience.
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:14.880]   - I got in our all electric Chevy Bolt,
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:16.320]   drove over to the outlet mall,
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:18.600]   circled once there were no parking spaces, came home.
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:19.920]   That was it, it was fun.
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:20.760]   - Exactly.
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:22.520]   - I said, what are we thinking?
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:24.120]   - You see, I'm pointing you laptop at the moment.
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:26.120]   I thought, oh, great, Black Friday,
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:29.040]   I've got the weekend clear, let me have a look through.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:31.040]   It's junk, you know, I mean,
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.720]   they're doing Black Friday models,
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:36.000]   which are basically, that's clear out the old components.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000]   Stick a lower price tag on it and call it a sale.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.240]   - It's like Prime Day, or the Nordstrom sale,
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:42.560]   which is another thing that drops in July.
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:44.680]   And those are both meant to pump up sales numbers.
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:47.840]   They do it with merchandise that no one would buy
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:48.840]   in the other time of the year,
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:50.840]   if it worked for the fact that it's deeply on sale.
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.000]   - $1.2 billion more spent online on Friday
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000]   than the year before, significant growth.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:03.000]   Interestingly, 2.9 billion of that 7.4 was on smartphones.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.960]   And that's growing at an even faster rate than computers.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:12.200]   - Instagram is a great shopping game.
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:14.000]   - Oh man, that's what I actually,
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.400]   that's why I killed Instagram.
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.400]   - It is phenomenal with how easy it is
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:19.360]   for people to buy things, just swipe up.
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:21.120]   - It's very effective.
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:24.120]   And with Apple Pay and all these new technologies,
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:26.280]   you don't have to even enter any numbers or anything.
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:28.600]   You just go, "Yeah, yeah, that's me."
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:31.200]   No, that's, although I found an interesting thing,
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:33.800]   if you only follow one person on Instagram,
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:34.880]   you don't get ads.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.920]   - Really?
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:37.920]   - I don't know why.
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:39.640]   - Stealing, I have to say to put Instagram account,
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:40.480]   try that out.
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:42.320]   - My good idea is to do it at the moment.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:44.080]   - I have an account, but it's not public,
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:45.200]   and I only follow my wife,
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:47.320]   'cause that's where she puts all her pictures.
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:49.320]   So I have to, and I've never seen that.
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:52.520]   So I feel like that's the safe way to use Instagram.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:56.200]   The popular products on Friday,
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:58.960]   toys on the theme of Frozen 2,
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:01.680]   you will know this, Ms. Ishmaiser.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:04.400]   Will you tell me what an LOL surprise is?
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:05.400]   - Oh God.
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:07.040]   - Is that one of those unboxing?
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:11.200]   - I don't know the providence of the brand.
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.360]   They're being cross-promoted pretty heavily on Amazon Prime
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:17.120]   as well, and they're these--
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:18.040]   - Collectibles.
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:19.040]   - Yeah, and--
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:20.280]   - They're little dollies.
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:22.200]   - With enormous heads and enormous eyes.
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:24.800]   - Last time I showed the video, we got taken down.
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:26.120]   - It's like that Shopkins and the Powerpuff Girls,
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:29.520]   like, had some sort of unholy genetic mashup,
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:30.520]   and this is what--
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:31.760]   - But then you said you've got a young girl,
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.600]   so Frozen 2 has got to be high on the--
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.480]   - Oh yeah.
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:35.320]   - Let it go.
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.560]   - Karen's got two daughters, and it's just like--
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:39.920]   - No, it's all anyone's talking about.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:40.760]   - Yeah, he was talking about--
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.960]   - Paul Patrol was a big seller, you know what Paul pictures?
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.520]   - Yeah, I know what she was talking about.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:45.960]   (laughing)
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:46.800]   - Best selling--
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:48.640]   - You'd be at the best of Pat--
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:50.320]   - But her cohort has younger brothers and sisters,
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:52.240]   and so you sort of--
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:53.360]   - Oh, these aren't for nine-year-olds,
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:54.200]   these are for younger--
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.240]   - Yeah, Paul Patrol is for little kids.
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:57.080]   I've been told--
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:58.640]   - I thought little kids were nine, but that would be--
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:02.240]   - No, no, they're almost tweens, I have been informed.
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:03.400]   (laughing)
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:05.920]   - Mom, I just want you to know, I'm almost a tween.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.600]   - No, no, she's into Lego, so--
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.240]   - Oh good, no, we have a much better.
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:10.680]   - So we've had these few of you--
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:13.720]   - Best selling video games, clearly these are pain--
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:15.480]   - At her birthday party in October,
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:16.760]   one of the things we had the kids do
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:18.960]   was the Lego Walk of Fire, where we wanted to--
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:20.560]   - Oh, like that. - Where we have to walk
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:22.880]   across the carpets here with Legos and the end up prizes
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:23.720]   at the end.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:24.800]   - That's a good idea.
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:26.200]   I do like Russ.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:29.400]   - What is worse, the small brick or a big brick?
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:30.240]   I think-- - Small.
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:31.080]   - Really?
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:32.000]   - Because they get infected in your foot.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.880]   Whereas the big ones, like for whatever reason,
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.320]   because there's a greater surface area,
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:36.520]   it's less pressure, I guess.
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:38.360]   - Yeah, that's the secret.
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:40.080]   - I would just have the indian yogis
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:41.160]   in a nutshell, right?
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:42.680]   (laughing)
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:44.960]   Best selling games, FIFA 20, the soccer game,
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:47.760]   Madden 20, the football game, and a Nintendo Switch.
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:48.800]   I'm not surprised.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.360]   - Switching games. - No, the Switch is a good game.
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:51.200]   - Yeah.
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.560]   - Best selling electronics, Apple, laptops,
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:55.120]   AirPods, oh Apple.
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:57.480]   In fact, AirPods Pro sales--
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:59.000]   - Doubled. - Doubled.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.960]   They actually doubled their order,
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:04.560]   according to the supply chain, and Samsung TVs.
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:07.280]   - You make good ones, but yeah.
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:08.120]   - Yeah.
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:10.320]   - This is Adobe Analytics.
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:13.040]   Adobe get into this business, it's kind of odd.
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:15.320]   - It's still no singles day.
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:17.080]   - Singles day is still the biggest--
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:17.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:19.680]   - Get ready for this, Ali Baba alone.
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:20.600]   - Is this a billion or something?
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:22.800]   - $38 billion. - Yeah.
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:25.800]   Wow, that was earlier this year.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.640]   - It's interesting how different customs do their sales
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:29.080]   with singles day, you know?
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.840]   It's just like, "Hi, you're single today.
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:33.600]   "You must be so depressed by this,
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:35.960]   "you must go out and buy stuff immediately."
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:38.400]   - Sales at Target down 12%,
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:40.600]   JC Penny down 14%.
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:42.920]   I think they're both out of business, I may be wrong.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:45.320]   - I was like, I don't know where you'd find one of those.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:46.640]   - Target? - And yeah.
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:47.480]   - Are they gone?
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:48.320]   - No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:49.760]   - It's came hard, it's gone.
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:50.600]   - Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:51.440]   - I can't, it's gone.
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:54.120]   - Target just re-read it a whole way.
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:54.960]   - New.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:55.800]   - Well, they're not doing well.
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:57.600]   - I think it's just recently though, it's just,
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:15:59.640]   it's big, it's chaotic, it's loud.
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:00.480]   - eBay was new.
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:01.320]   - Yeah.
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:02.160]   - You know who the big winner?
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:04.560]   - I'll go to Tanger for Epsom salts,
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:05.400]   I'm not supposed to.
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:06.240]   - Epsom salts.
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:07.080]   - I mean, it's generally for me,
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:09.560]   Target is where you go when you need something right now.
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:10.400]   - Yeah.
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:12.280]   - If I need to, oh, I need that, I want,
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:14.040]   and then 90% of the time it's not there.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:15.360]   - Yeah. - Yeah, so it's, you're just like,
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:16.200]   oh, I should've just ordered it.
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:19.760]   - No, it's, and it's cut down, like what really,
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:22.760]   for me annihilated my Target runs was Amazon
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:24.160]   starting to do same day.
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:25.000]   - Yeah.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:25.840]   - Right.
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:27.000]   - Cause I'll, now I'll always check Amazon and go,
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.200]   am I gonna get it today?
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:29.680]   And if I'm gonna get it today, I'm not gonna get out of my,
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:30.560]   I'm not gonna leave my house.
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:31.400]   - Today.
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:32.400]   - Our family does something.
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:35.720]   - So in Nevada, there must be a warehouse somewhere near us.
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:37.200]   - There is a warehouse in Nevada, yeah.
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:38.040]   - Because, because about--
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:38.880]   - Let's just drive it over.
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:41.240]   - About a third of the things I order are like,
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:42.440]   would you like them today for free?
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:44.200]   And I'm like, yes, I would have that.
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:45.040]   - Are you home?
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:46.000]   Cause I'll just drive it over.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000]   It's, it's like hours that it shows up.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:50.840]   - Yeah, interesting.
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:51.680]   - That's really cool.
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:54.320]   - So I will say we donate to a pajama slipper drive
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:55.480]   that our island runs every year.
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:57.400]   And what I did is I did buy on Target.com
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:16:59.320]   and then just drive over, pick up and drive out.
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:00.760]   But the store was like a battle zone,
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:03.120]   like just bodies and carts flying everywhere.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:05.320]   And I just went, picked up my thing the same day.
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:06.680]   Went, picked up my thing the same day,
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:08.560]   walked out with my eight pairs of slippers again.
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:13.320]   And was like, this is, this is the way to shop.
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:14.160]   - Yeah.
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.160]   - I didn't buy the slippers on Black Friday,
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:17.480]   I hasten to add, but it's, I can see why
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:19.480]   Target sales might be down is because if it's
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:21.920]   a profoundly unpleasant shopping experience
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:24.600]   without a perceived door buster bargain,
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:25.680]   why would you go?
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:26.920]   - No, exactly.
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.400]   And so although I did look, there was a comment on,
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:31.600]   I think it was Reddit yesterday,
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:33.720]   it's just like Thursday, America,
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:36.080]   we give thanks for friendship and family.
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:38.240]   Friday will stabs on in the neck for a 10-minute
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:39.760]   - I've never tasted it, you know.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:43.600]   - No, we do the opt out thing and go to a park
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:46.520]   that day usually, but that said, I don't forget,
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:47.920]   I understand in some families Black Friday,
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:49.800]   it's like, whoo, it's our tradition, we go out.
[02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:51.080]   - Well, I mean, I saw some footage,
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:53.680]   I was on Reddit, so I'm not sure how accurate it was,
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:55.760]   but it was a Canadian Black Friday.
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.240]   And they open the door and the people are lining
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:00.240]   and the panicked person goes, "After you."
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:01.080]   (laughing)
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:02.400]   - Oh, that's sweet.
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:03.480]   - Did, no, it is.
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:05.080]   - And don't forget tomorrow, it was Cyber Monday.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:08.000]   So that's another round of traffic boosting
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:08.840]   sales.
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:09.680]   - Oh, well, they just be listening.
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:11.720]   - And then Giving Tuesday comes after that,
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:13.720]   and then there's a whole bunch more made up
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:16.080]   shopping milestones, like the last free shipping day
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:16.920]   and things like that.
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:19.760]   - But this year, they've started to do Black Friday
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:21.000]   in the UK.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:21.840]   - Oh, wow.
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:24.360]   - And people are just like, what the hell is this?
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:26.520]   We don't have Thanksgiving for goodness sake.
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:27.360]   - Yeah.
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:29.000]   - You've just run just hawkers cheap tat
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.160]   in the hope that we'll buy it.
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:31.000]   - And it's working.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.040]   - Like the salivating animals we are, we will, you know.
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:36.640]   - Does talking as cheap tat have anything to do with
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:39.280]   a sleeping or is that another kind of tat?
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:40.200]   - Sleeving?
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:42.720]   - Tat is another word for Nick Knackery or
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:43.560]   - Yeah.
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:44.400]   - Cheek-gim crackery.
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:46.840]   - So for example, we, in the register, we describe Amazon
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:49.160]   as an online tat, sorry, as a cloud store,
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:52.440]   a cloud computing company with an online tat suit,
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:53.720]   but a suit attached.
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:55.200]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:59.880]   - Does, it's December 1st, did you all open your first
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:01.280]   advent calendar door?
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:02.120]   - Yes.
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:03.040]   - What was yours?
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:03.880]   What'd you get?
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:06.160]   - So we actually have two.
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:08.160]   We have the Lego Star Wars advent calendar.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:09.160]   - Oh, nice.
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:10.160]   - Ah, okay.
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:11.000]   - Oh, nice.
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.280]   - And what we do is we have one of those big German
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.000]   wooden advent calendars with the little drawers
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:17.840]   that you've bought.
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:18.680]   - Oh, those are cute.
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:19.520]   - Yeah, Lisa does that.
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:21.160]   She puts a dollar bill in each one or so.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:23.120]   - Wow, Lisa is much more generous than I am
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:24.880]   'cause we just do like a different holiday activity
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:25.720]   every day.
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:26.800]   (laughing)
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:27.840]   - I'm gonna be smarter.
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:29.680]   - But I hope your kids don't listen to the shows.
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:32.360]   - I'm ordering the, right now it's a little late,
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:35.720]   but I'll just double up on it, the hot sauce.
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:38.720]   - Advent calendar, that every 25 days
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:40.560]   of tiny little hot sauces.
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:42.080]   - I've gotta say, what with Brexit
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.240]   and the British election campaign,
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:44.360]   I'm thinking about making my own
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:46.480]   and every little door you open has excrements in it,
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:47.320]   but no.
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:50.040]   (laughing)
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:52.600]   - Now our homemade advent calendar will have,
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:54.400]   one night will be like we watch Elf, another night.
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:55.240]   - Oh, that's cute.
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:56.920]   - We make Christmas cookies and other vids.
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:58.880]   We go to a fancy neighborhood and walk around.
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:19:59.720]   - Okay, yeah.
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:02.200]   - So you're a nice person.
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:03.400]   - I basically have like a spreadsheet
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:05.400]   where I just cut out things and stick 'em in the doors.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:06.560]   - Oh, that's cute.
[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:08.200]   Although you could choose the word that,
[02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:09.600]   oh, it's your advent.
[02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:11.080]   Go and clean your room, right?
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:13.720]   (laughing)
[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:15.120]   This is why I'm not a parent.
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:17.000]   - Now he's mouth off me one too many times
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.000]   as you're missing this.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.480]   (laughing)
[02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:21.320]   - That's Lisa Schmeiser.
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.880]   She's a great mama, editor at ITPro.
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:28.200]   Today she's @lschmeiser on the Twitter.
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:29.800]   And it's always a pleasure to have you.
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:30.640]   - Thank you.
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:32.200]   - Thank you for making your way
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:34.680]   through the Atmospheric River
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:35.880]   to be here with us today.
[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:39.080]   Same for you, Alex Lindsay from Nevada.
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:40.680]   (laughing)
[02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:42.360]   He is on the Twitter as well.
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:47.200]   Alex Lindsay with an A, A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:50.120]   Anything exciting coming up in your life?
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:52.280]   - I am going to be producing some videos
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:53.120]   in the next week or two.
[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:57.000]   I'm just finishing up a little home studio to shoot them.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.600]   And so mostly technical stuff.
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:01.440]   And then again, next week we're gonna try to figure out
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:03.880]   what this aircraft part is that I have sitting in my desk.
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:04.720]   - It's very exciting.
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:05.560]   That's exciting.
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:06.400]   You can put that on Twitter.
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:07.560]   - I found the Twitter.
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:10.320]   The Twitter is very useful for these ladies.
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:13.600]   It's been sitting around on my desk for maybe 15 years,
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:16.000]   maybe 20 years, and I don't know what it is.
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.360]   I make things up about it, but I don't know.
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:18.200]   - Does it write Reddit for them?
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:19.040]   What is this thing?
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:20.480]   They will generally sort it out with it.
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:21.640]   - They're amazing.
[02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:22.480]   They are just there.
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:24.240]   - It's nice that it can't do.
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:25.160]   - I'm gonna start on Twitter.
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:27.040]   If Twitter fails, then I'm gonna put it on Reddit.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:28.040]   - Okay, yeah.
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:32.640]   - Ian Thompson, your holiday plans, are you...
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:35.160]   Well, my whole year's now, oh, for Christmas,
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:37.640]   I'm taking the full British Christmas, Christmas Eve
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:38.800]   to New Year's Day.
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:39.640]   - Nice.
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:40.760]   - Like getting the whole spread,
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:44.000]   because I swear there is nothing worse
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.720]   when I first came over here
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:48.480]   and having to get up on Boxing Day morning at 7 a.m.
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:49.920]   and go into work.
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:52.720]   And it was just, I'd lower this.
[02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:54.320]   It's just wrong.
[02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:57.120]   Boxing Day is for recovering with a hangover,
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:00.560]   eating bits of turkey that you didn't meet before.
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:03.680]   - Yeah, that's the concept that you could work the day
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:06.200]   after Christmas is just horrifying to me.
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:11.200]   - Follow him on the Twitter, I-A-N-I-I-N-T-H-O-M-S-A-M.
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:13.440]   - My parents have busted us.
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:14.600]   We've had words about this.
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:15.440]   - Sculpted us.
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:16.280]   - Sculpted us.
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:20.320]   - And of course, he's in the registered.co.uk.
[02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:24.120]   We are doing our annual holiday show on Thursday,
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:25.240]   our Twitter holiday show.
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:27.440]   We prerecorded so that we don't have to be here
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:28.560]   on the holiday.
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:30.240]   I think it's gonna run the day after Christmas.
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:33.120]   I think it's a boxing day that it runs.
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:34.520]   Or is it Christmas Eve that it runs?
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:36.600]   I can't remember, it's close to Christmas.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:37.840]   - Christmas is Wednesday?
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:38.960]   - Christmas is Wednesday?
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:40.120]   Oh, well never mind.
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:43.720]   Is it the Sunday before or is it the Sunday after?
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:45.760]   - It is the Sunday before Christmas.
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:46.600]   - Okay.
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:47.600]   - It's the 22nd.
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:48.520]   - 22nd.
[02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:50.480]   And it's going to be,
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.240]   we like to bring in different hosts.
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:54.800]   We've done different groups in the past.
[02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:56.520]   This time Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:00.640]   Mary Jo Foley.
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:01.760]   And.
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:02.600]   - Lori Gill.
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:03.680]   - Lori Gill.
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:05.440]   So that's gonna be a lot of fun.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:09.000]   And each of them gets their own special drink and hot sauce.
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.640]   Should be a lot of fun.
[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:12.480]   That will be taping that.
[02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:13.960]   What time on Thursday, Carston?
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:17.120]   - That will be 2 p.m. on Thursday, 2 p.m. Pacific.
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:18.640]   - 5 p.m. Eastern.

[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:21.160]   - Yes.
[02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:22.160]   - It was the night before Christmas
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.000]   and all through the house.
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:23.880]   Not the thing was stirring,
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:25.160]   not even a clicking mouse.
[02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:26.880]   - Not a clicking.
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:28.480]   - We do Twitch every Sunday afternoon.
[02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:32.040]   Round about 230 Pacific, 5 30 Eastern, 22 30 UTC.
