[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.040]   Welcome to this week's Tech episode 260.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.520]   I am Tom Erich, filling in for the vacationing Leo Laport.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.240]   He is actually driving his daughter up to college.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.840]   Oh, really?
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760]   Oh, that is so sweet.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.000]   But we have assembled a fine, fine group of guests,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.600]   some of my favorite people in the world here
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.200]   to help us fill in the gaps.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.640]   Of course, first of all, Molly Wood, executive editor
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.200]   of cnet.com.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.320]   I am so happy to be here.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.640]   We're talking tech again together.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.320]   Yay!
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440]   I know, in the same room and everything.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.280]   Exactly.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.640]   Thanks for coming all the way up here.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.080]   It was great.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.040]   Of course, yeah.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.400]   Of course, Molly Wood also hosts a Buzz Out Loud,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.240]   a fantastic tech podcast on CNET every day at 10.30 AM
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.320]   Pacific.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.080]   Yeah, it's like the second best way to get daily tech news.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   Every once in a while, I accidentally
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.280]   type live.cnet.com in my Twitter feed still.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.880]   Until the chatroom yells at me.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.720]   But yeah, so you can find her at cnet.com/molly.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.520]   Goes to all your stuff.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   Goes to all the video.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.960]   All the video stuff.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.720]   Yeah, plus report the tech review, that kind of stuff.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.160]   And cnet.com/molly rants if you just
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.200]   want the ranty stuff.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.320]   In text form.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.880]   In text form.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.520]   Actual written rants.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.040]   Written rants.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.520]   That's my deal.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.360]   Ritants.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.440]   Ritants.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.880]   Never mind.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.760]   Patrick Bezia, also hosting--
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.680]   We missed each other.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.040]   Also joining us host of La Ronde VuTech.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   You can find him at frenchpin.com.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.720]   Welcome, Patrick.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.320]   Hey, guys.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.400]   Thanks so much for having me.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.360]   I am a big fan of many of your podcasts,
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   including The Phileas Club, which
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.960]   is, I think, an ingenious idea, finding people
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   in various areas of the world, bringing them together
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.240]   to discuss the news of the day for the world,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.760]   as well as news in their area, getting
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.880]   a lot of different perspectives.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   You just recorded one, right?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.520]   Yeah, we recorded an epic 2 and 1/2 hour show
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.320]   where Sean Coons, a good friend of mine,
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.200]   wanted to discuss religion.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.560]   So that's sort of dynamite podcasting there.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.960]   Oh, come on.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.560]   Take on a controversial topic next time.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.760]   I mean, really.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.200]   Religion.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.240]   No, we had a lot of fun.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.240]   We had people from all over, and it was great.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.480]   And finally, someone I have been
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.400]   an admirer for quite a long time.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.880]   Nili Patel, managing editor of Engadget.com.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.760]   And I actually have learned how to pronounce your name correctly
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.040]   now.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.320]   So I mean--
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.480]   Well, even admirer of me for a long time.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.880]   You have poor taste in dudes.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.720]   You've got to say.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.600]   It is my job and has been for like five years
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.880]   to look at all of the tech news of the day.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.400]   And I have to say, more frequently than other names,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.720]   Nili Patel Byline shows up in my final lineups,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.840]   both when I was at Buzz Out Loud and on Tech News today.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.800]   Well, I do try to be as confident and pretentious as possible.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.920]   So whoever you're paying to write your posts--
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.800]   Hey, I do that too.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.240]   --should give them a raise.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.160]   That robot army is really, really--
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.400]   and those are the best thousand monkeys I've ever bought.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.880]   You should throw that into a second Diet Coke.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.000]   As you can find, of course, Nili@engadget.com.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.200]   Do you have another URL to promote as well?
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.760]   I wish I did, but I had done it.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.600]   Everything in Gagit pretty much locks us in.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.680]   I'm not actually allowed to leave the house anymore.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.680]   It's pretty much sit here typing constantly.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.240]   Right, right.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.040]   Well, so you hear a noise in the background
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.800]   during the show today.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.400]   You'll understand why.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.320]   Exactly.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   The right hand has to keep going.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.440]   I'm blogging right now.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.120]   You're blogging.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.960]   I'm blogging this.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.240]   I really-- I just wanted to clear up
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.400]   what my right hand was doing.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.360]   That's a good idea.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.640]   Yeah, we don't want this to go off the rails.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.120]   So as I am filling in for Leo LaPorte,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.480]   we will be talking about Twitter.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.680]   We'll be revealing someone's World of Warcraft name.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.480]   We'll be going on about Facebook.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.560]   Is there anything else I'm missing?
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.560]   A three hour show.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.040]   It'll be a three hour show.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.720]   I'm trying to jump in as best I can.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.000]   There is a big story breaking today, though.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.680]   TechCrunch saying that the Verizon iPhone rumors are true,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.000]   that in fact, they have sources,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.120]   and they go into a long description of supply chain
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.920]   evidentiary trails that they've followed,
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.520]   that say CDMA chips are being ordered by Apple
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.720]   in numbers that imply that they'll have a Verizon iPhone
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.640]   by January.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   Lather, rinse, and rupees.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640]   It's ridiculous.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.880]   I've never heard this before.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   Well, that's a claim that Qualcomm is producing CDMA chips
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.360]   for Apple in the past three years or so.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.800]   This rumor has never occurred.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.720]   That's the one.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.280]   But now they're giving a time frame.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.000]   It's January.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.080]   They never did that before.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.640]   I've never heard a time frame before.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.640]   It's no way.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.160]   No way.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.000]   Oh, no.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.520]   Sorry.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.000]   No, they did.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.280]   I think that the time frame always starts with J.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.520]   It's either June or July of whatever year you're in.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   So January.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.280]   Verizon--
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.760]   So the U part is actually January.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.520]   That's the--
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.320]   Verizon CEO has also been signed on to do a keynote at CES.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.520]   Not that surprising, but everyone's
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.880]   trying to throw that into this rumor mix as well.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.360]   Well, no, actually--
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.480]   Simon, that is a little surprising.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.240]   So that's just surprising.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   OK, why is that surprising?
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.800]   It's usually--
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.280]   usually Steve Baumer does the pre-show keynote,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.880]   and then like Ford will do the later keynote,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.960]   as part of the official show.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.080]   Or some other company that we actually
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.240]   don't pay that much attention to.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.480]   Verizon is new.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.080]   And I think what Verizon's going to do,
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.400]   my hunch is that they're going to do Android tablets
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.840]   in conjunction with Google.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.560]   That's sort of the time frame we've been hearing for a long time.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.200]   Google-- it's one of the only Android tablet you can really
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.560]   go out and buy in the States right now.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.600]   It's just like off-brand, Ogden tablet.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.120]   It came out for $150.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.840]   It's running in fringing Google Apps.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.960]   And so that's sort of amazing.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.880]   That's sort of the Android tablet you can buy.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.160]   Not discounting the Arcos tablets,
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.560]   but they're sort of harder to find in the States.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.040]   So I think the big push is going to be Google--
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.120]   in Verizon coming on stage here at CES,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.400]   and you're like, check out our new tablet strategy.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.760]   And that makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.320]   But Verizon to show up without Apple
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.760]   and be like, check out the new iPhone?
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.840]   Makes no sense to me.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.080]   I hate to give credence to this rumor again.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.280]   But I mean--
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.680]   You haven't been predicting this for a while.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.040]   Yeah, we all know it's coming.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.480]   I mean, I think there is no question
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.320]   that Apple is eventually going to open up to other carriers.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.640]   What I find weird and surprising about this is,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.120]   my assumption has always been they won't make a Verizon iPhone
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.440]   until it's LTE.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.320]   And that they weren't going to make a CDMA iPhone.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.840]   And that's the part of this that I still
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.720]   find a little bit implausible that they would be,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.480]   at this point, when Verizon has already started testing,
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.920]   very limited testing, but some testing of LTE networks,
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.240]   in some areas, that they would be ordering large quantities
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.320]   of this basically outdated technology.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.800]   The press release that says that Ivan Seidenberg will
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.680]   be delivering the keynote says he will highlight
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.080]   the company's vision for its LTE 4G wireless technology.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.640]   And it would that see-- and it wouldn't surprise me
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.200]   if they said that's going to include iPhone.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.080]   But then that doesn't really work with this rumor.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.320]   Yeah, it doesn't work with the Qualcomm CDV chip.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.040]   Because they do have dual mode chips, right?
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.960]   But that's like those are bigger, they're more complicated,
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.160]   they're undoubtedly going to involve more battery drain.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.080]   All of that seems like compromises to me.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.400]   And I don't think Apple's a sort of company that wants
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.720]   to get away from AT&T so badly that they're
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.120]   going to make huge compromises on battery life
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.000]   and maybe even size to get dual mode CDMA LTE.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.800]   I think they're more than happy to wait.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.080]   I mean, what do they have to lose?
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.000]   They're selling the iPhone as fast as they can make them.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.600]   Like, keep saying it.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.680]   We can't make them quickly now.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.320]   I totally agree.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.400]   As soon as the white one comes on, whenever that is,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.880]   I think they're going to sell even more.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.920]   Is that something seriously not out yet?
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.120]   You still can't get the white one?
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.880]   I still can't make it.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.120]   Walt Mossberg is the only person in America.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.360]   Of course he is.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.160]   Well, the best rumor I've seen as to why
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.320]   is they can't figure out how to stop light from coming out
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:17.840]   of the back.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.120]   I'm just like, why don't you turn that into a feature?
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.600]   It's the new glowing back.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.680]   Yeah, like a flashlight.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.640]   It's revolutionary.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's like a warm, cozy nightlight.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.600]   Just give it a neat light.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.920]   The nightlight phone.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.240]   The nightlight light.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:31.800]   Amazing.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.440]   No other phone can both make phone calls
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.800]   and keep you safe at night.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   OK.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.160]   We think you're going to love it.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.920]   Make you a target for snipers.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.200]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.640]   Well, I'm glad you pointed this out, Neelite,
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.000]   because I didn't realize he was doing the key key note.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.200]   So he's replacing bomber.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.640]   I just thought he was doing one of the-- because they
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.840]   have those later keynotes.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.360]   Is that--
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.640]   I don't think he's replacing-- no, he's just one of the keynotes.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.040]   So yeah, so bomber does the pre-show keynotes,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.120]   day before CS official.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.000]   He's still doing that.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.200]   Which is always a little stupid, because we all go to that.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.280]   It's like CS already started for the press,
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.800]   because mic shot 2D.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.240]   I have no idea.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.600]   They always have a puzzle of keynoters.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.840]   They do for-- they've usually got Michael Dell or somebody
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.160]   like that.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.920]   So it's not totally surprising.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.400]   They used to have Paul.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.200]   These all--
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:20.920]   They have Paul.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   The good old days.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.880]   Paul doesn't do anything anymore.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.280]   They do an off-site where they pull out a product
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.600]   that they're going to announce the next six months.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.720]   They don't tell anything about it.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.760]   They put it away.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.560]   And then Intel usually closes out the show.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.080]   They're a huge key.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.880]   So it's not that unusual that they would have somebody
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.000]   to basically replace the Dell packet.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.560]   It is interesting.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.080]   It's been a big deal.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.400]   It is interesting to see Verizon come into that mix.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.680]   And I think the tablet theory that you put out there is right.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.280]   But this 4G LTE line in the press release
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.960]   adds a little fuel to the intrigue fire.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.440]   However--
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.240]   Well, it's gotten rumors that they're launching test markets
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.640]   like in 2011.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.120]   So that makes a lot of sense there.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.480]   I'd say, look, we're turning it on.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   And where is the Idaho, you know,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.960]   wherever tiny test markets they have?
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.800]   And even if they don't have the iPhone by then,
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.720]   they're going to hint at it because they want it.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.680]   I mean, the thing we do know is that Verizon wants the iPhone.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.280]   And they have said very publicly,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.360]   we would love to have a Verizon iPhone.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.800]   It's just that Apple's been holding out.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.560]   And I think their thing they're holding out for is LTE.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.440]   Well, it would seem very strange that Apple would go
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.640]   for the limited LTE network already.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.760]   It would seem a little bit too soon.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.360]   I don't know.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.640]   I would from the outside.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.120]   But about that CDMA chip, don't they already
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.640]   produce CDMA iPhones for other markets?
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.120]   No.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.040]   No.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.360]   GSM is the global standard.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.280]   There were those weird little tests
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.440]   where they were showing app.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.280]   What was it?
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.880]   Like data requests on a CDMA iPhone.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.040]   And that was part of the--
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.360]   they think there's a possibility they've been testing it.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.040]   They've most likely made a CDMA iPhone.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.240]   Right.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.600]   I'm sure they have.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.640]   But not a factory production model.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.280]   Are they really going to re-engineer it?
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.960]   I don't know.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.400]   The dual chip is a possibility, I guess.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.360]   We'll see.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   We'll have this rumor to kick around at least 20 times
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.760]   between now and CES.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.960]   There's no way Apple's going to allow Verizon
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.480]   to announce an iPhone at CES.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.480]   Yeah, it does not have.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.280]   I think that is 100% sure.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.800]   Unless Steve Jobs is also there.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.760]   Oh, even that's not going to have a problem.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   Awesome.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   Somebody Twitter that.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   That is--
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.760]   Verizon.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   That's just me.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   That's just me.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.760]   That's into your rumor right now.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.760]   It's going to be there.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.760]   This is a real reason.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.760]   And then it will--
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.760]   From months is that the white iPhone is the CDMA iPhone.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   Oh.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.760]   Oh.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.760]   He's been working on it for months.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   Like just feeding it out of the white iPhone.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.760]   And we've seen it pop up here and there.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.160]   So wait, Neelai, so what you're saying is the white iPhone
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160]   is the CDMA iPhone?
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.160]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.160]   There's an app.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   There's an app.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   Take that to the bank.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   Totally Twitter that right now.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   Verizon, CEO Ivan Seidel will introduce the white CDMA iPhone.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160]   It's guaranteed.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   Done.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   And with Steve Jobs on stage with him.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   Why not?
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   Icing on the cake.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   While we're at it, Flash is coming to iPhone 4.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   That's actually-- we're not making that up.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   That's actually happening.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   Yeah, it means sort of.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160]   You got a jail break it.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160]   And then you can install something called "Fresh,"
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160]   which is an homage to Strongbad.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   Totally.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160]   Yes.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160]   Oh, cool.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.160]   But yeah, so it's the best workaround to adding Flash
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160]   to your iPad and iPhone.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160]   As long as you're willing to jailbreak.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.160]   As long as you're willing to jailbreak.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.160]   Yeah, very well done.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   So COMEX, the guy who developed it, says it's alpha quality.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160]   So you should, you know, buyer beware.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160]   You know, you should run it.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   It'll probably kill your battery really fast.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160]   And again, to install it, you know, involves some steps.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   But it's there.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   You know, we always knew the jailbreak eyes
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   would be the ones to do it, right?
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   There was never any doubt that there would be the ones to figure it out.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   It's just funny, because it's like once that's out there,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   like sort of the last, like, big nerd objection to the iPhone
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   and not having Flash is sort of gone.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   It's like, well, Adobe should have just put out a jailbreak version
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160]   of Flash years ago.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160]   You know, like this conversation would have been open.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   It's true.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160]   It's like--
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   I think the nerds, though, who have decided, like,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160]   I'm not-- I'm just not doing that, you know, philosophically.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   They're not going to be convinced by the fact.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   I mean, I guess, or you think you could say, like,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   there's a moral high ground to be taken.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   I hacked it and I'm running Flash on it or whatever.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   But it's like, I think most of those nerds, including myself,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   have now just defected to Android and are happily living over there
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160]   with the Froyo and the Flash, you know, happy to have it.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   So is it--
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160]   I was just using Flash and an Evo today,
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   which I was actually really, like, compressive.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160]   It works.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.160]   I was going to suggest, I mean, if you get an Evo,
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160]   Flash and the battery problems pre-installed.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   Exactly.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.160]   You don't need a jail breaker.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160]   It's just--
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   Yeah, that's not going to be my question, actually.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.160]   Is now that we have all these fantastic Android phones with Flash,
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.160]   is it actually worth it?
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   Do you guys use it or is it like, OK, I can do it if I want,
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   but I actually never do?
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   Well, I mean, it sort of depends on what your use case is.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   Like, it's nice to be able to stream one of these live shows, right?
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   Like, there was one day when I was driving and I was like, oh,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   it's actually like, start streaming TNT and just have it--
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160]   listen, you know, have it playing on the phone on the seat.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   Like, I'm not watching it, but I can hear it.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   Or, you know, those frequent cases where the--
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   that's--
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   the phone honestly is the device that I'm using when I'm sitting
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   on the couch, sort of just checking my email and surfing,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   and it's nice if somebody has sent me a link to a video
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   that I can watch without having to kind of get up and go to a real computer.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   Restaurant websites on the go.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   There you go.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   The E-L-D-F Flash is like, Killer app for me.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.160]   Yep.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.160]   But, you know, it's like, for that of a workground,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160]   because on the iPhone I have menu pages and that works fine.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.160]   You know, it's like--
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   it's just one of those things where it's--
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160]   now that it's there, I don't worry about it anymore.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160]   And when I go back to the iPhone and I don't have it,
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160]   you know, it's as irritating as it ever was, which was--
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160]   actually not so irritating at all, but it's nice to have.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   It's one of those things where it's like, well, now I have it.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   Like, why is this-- why have we made such a fuss about it?
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160]   Like, here it is.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   I have to say, like, on the iPad, I find the lack of Flash
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   supremely noticeable in an oint.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   I mean, really to the point that I just, like,
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160]   usually use my netbook instead.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160]   I mean, I have to kind of come up with reasons now
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   to use the iPad if it's not entertaining my child,
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160]   which, honestly, is its primary purpose.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.160]   What are the sites, in particular, that you're trying to get to
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160]   that just fail?
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160]   Mainly, I am trying to watch video.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160]   And then, often, those restaurant websites, and then often--
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   and then there are just sites with, like, Flash plus JavaScript,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160]   right, that doesn't work really well.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.160]   Like, I wanted to look up-- I was going to see Salt,
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160]   and I wanted to look on RunP.com,
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   and see, like, when would be the good opportunities?
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   You know, nothing to it.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   And then, add to that the fact that the Google Docs-- you can't
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   edit, like, a word doc.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   It's just kind of like, all right, this thing--
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.160]   RunP is great, by the way.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.160]   Flash?
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   Oh, is it?
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.160]   RunP is awesome.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.160]   That's not a Flash thing.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   That's, like, an additional barrier, but it's kind of a Google
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.160]   problem.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   I'm not blaming the iPad for it.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   It's just that, you know, it compounds.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.160]   RunP is the site that tells you when in the movie is a good time
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   to go to the bathroom.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160]   It's awesome.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160]   And it's kind of spoilery, so they actually hide the text
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160]   and you have to highlight it to see, like, if you don't want to
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   get spoiled, then you highlight the text to see, like, this is a
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160]   good time, but it tells you when it's a good time during the
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.160]   movie to go pee.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   What time in?
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   So smart.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   That's amazing.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   But they have Flash?
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.160]   They have some JavaScript thing or something.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   It does, for some reason, it doesn't work on my phone.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   What's funny to me is when I'm using the iPad and an embedded
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   video does play.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160]   You're just kind of--
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   Oh, I know.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.160]   You're like, wow.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.160]   You're like, wait, that works.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.160]   That's amazing technology.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.160]   It's magical.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:39.160]   It's like 75% of the video on the web was available on the iPhone.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   He said it.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   Well, that was an unbelievably clever
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.160]   disassembly, basically, because what he said is, you know, 90%
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.160]   of the video on the web is encoded in something other than Flash,
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   which is totally true.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.160]   It's just that 90% of that same 90% is then being presented
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   in a Flash player.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.160]   And so it is still wrapped in Flash, even though it might
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.160]   be encoded as an M.O.V. or something else.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160]   And it was just so disingenuous.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   It was like, well, yeah, but it's all on the web in Flash.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160]   Right.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   It was funny as we--
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   You might be a little off-topic now.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.160]   Whoops.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.160]   Yeah, we've done.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.160]   We're doing our job.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.160]   We just implemented, with Viddler, like HTML5 video playback,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   and people are freaking out about it because now they can use it
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   on their phones and on the iPad.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.160]   And it's like, OK, well, you know, there's something we said
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.160]   for like these popular devices that don't have Flash,
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.160]   and all people really want is the video.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160]   Because nobody ever complained that they couldn't play our Flash ads.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160]   They only complained that they couldn't watch our videos.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.160]   And as soon as we saw them, nobody complains anymore.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.160]   Well, our readers didn't complain about Flash.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.160]   They complained about Flash because they're in gadget readers,
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   but not because of Engadget.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.160]   A lot of people--
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.160]   Is this complicated?
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   No, I think they're gonna--
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   No, I got it.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.160]   I follow.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160]   Whoa.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.160]   This is-- OK, I'm sorry.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.160]   I just got a little blown away by an advertisement
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.160]   on this New York Times page.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.160]   It was about to transition us into talking about Mr. Papermaster,
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160]   Mark Papermaster.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   Was it the bamboo touch?
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.160]   There is an advertisement that says,
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.160]   "Stuart Elliot's in advertising email.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.160]   Sign up for Stuart Elliot's exclusive column.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.160]   See a sample, and it includes my email address."
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.160]   Right?
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.160]   Except it's not my email address.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   At least it's not an email address I have used in this decade
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160]   or the past one.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.160]   It's an email address I haven't used since 1999.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   Is it the one you originally used to register with the New York Times?
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.160]   I guess so, probably back in the '90s.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.160]   It's algivity.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.160]   It's acedetecticconcentric.net.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.160]   It's the email address that gave me the username AceDetect.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   That's adorable.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.160]   It doesn't work anymore.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.160]   And also--
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   Maybe it's you from the past who's trying to tell you something.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   That's really funny.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   It's trying to get you from the past.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   I must sign up for this newsletter.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   Reaching out to you through theNewYorkTimes.com.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   All right, sorry for that digression.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   But Mark Papermaster, who is the Apple executive in charge of hardware
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   for the iPhone, among other things, has left the company,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.160]   and all the good rumors say he has been asked to leave the company.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.160]   And then, of course, the Wilder rumors say he's gotten fired
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.160]   over the antenna gate problem.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.160]   That it-- I mean, that was--
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.160]   Probably, if there was doubt, that that's what it is somewhat.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160]   He joined the company a year ago from IBM, right?
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.160]   And the year afterwards, he's like, "Oh, I'm going away.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.160]   I want to take vacations."
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.160]   It's obvious to you what it is.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   It's got to be.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.160]   Yeah, I mean, he joins the company.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.160]   He does that thing.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.160]   That's like his big claim to fame, probably, from the hardware design.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.160]   Well, no, he was a system on a chip guy.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.160]   He was a processor guy.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   So I think he came over-- I mean, he came over as head engineer
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   of mobile devices.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.160]   But he was a processor guy at IBM.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.160]   He was like a microprocessor architecture guy.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160]   Yeah, he--
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.160]   And he's coming to--
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.160]   He says he was an Apple.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.160]   Oh, sorry.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.160]   The new guy.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.160]   Right, but it's coming to Apple was very controversial as well,
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   right?
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.160]   Because IBM actually sued him and sued Apple for--
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   Right.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.160]   Am I totally not serious here?
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   They sued him and they sued Apple for violating his non-compete
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   with IBM, and eventually they settled and he got to come over.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   So I mean, his entire tenure at Apple has been controversial.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160]   Right.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   You know, he's leaving now.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.160]   It's like, well, who knows?
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.160]   I mean, Bob Nensfield has been the iPhone engineering guy in their
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   videos and their promo materials the entire time.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160]   You know, Papermaster was never around.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   We never saw what he did the way that Apple publicly shows off.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   It's other executives like Scott Forstaller, Johnny I,
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.160]   or Phil Schiller.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.160]   Bob Nensfield has always been that guy.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   So did he leave over the antenna?
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.160]   Or is he just not very good on camera?
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   Right.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   Who knows?
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   Or was that like he failed at that part of the job, so that's why he's leaving.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:53.160]   Like Mark, you know, we've put in front of the camera a few times now and it turns out you're just really unattractive
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160]   and we're going to have to let you go.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   Also, your name is kind of stupid, so maybe...
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.160]   Well, according to John Gruber, though, the thing that makes you wonder if it's antenna related is that according to John Gruber of
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.160]   Daring Fireball, who is basically, let's be honest, the unofficial mouthpiece of Apple these days, he was known
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.160]   around Apple as the antenna guy.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   Like he was given at least internal credit for the being, quote, the guy responsible for the antenna.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.160]   He was also then conspicuously absent from all the iPhone 4 promotional material.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   He wasn't at the press conference, even though supposedly he was really, you know, the hardware guy.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   Right.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   Which the press conference you could say, oh, well, he's taken the fall.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.160]   They're not going to let him go to the press conference.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   They're in the process of getting rid of him.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   Right.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   The videos, though, that was before any antenna gate had ever broken.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.160]   They filmed those long before.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   They knew.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   Gruber's trying to imply in that posting is there may have been problems with him already.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   He may not have been fitting in before antenna gate.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   And he said that from the get-go, actually, during the lawsuit, when they were, you know,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   they're doing discovery in Apple's emails were being released about how they hired him and all this stuff.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.160]   One of the emails was from Bob Mansfield, and he said, "Paper Masters, incredibly smart.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   He knows the field very well, but he is a long shot in every other way for this job."
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.160]   And maybe that just turned out to be true.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:23.160]   And maybe he was really smart about microprocessors and antenna design, but he didn't fit the culture of Apple or he wasn't good at leading team.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.160]   We don't know why he left.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.160]   Or he was both, right?
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.160]   He was a bad fit and he was a controversial hire and he was sort of troublesome.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   And then on top of that, he was responsible for the antenna.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   And that was just like one thing too far.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   Who knows?
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   Bob Mansfield's taken over his responsibilities, though.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   I'll put it to you this way.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:47.160]   Johnny Ive now has led the design of many Apple products that have significant flaws that the company has had to take PR hits for, right?
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.160]   iPods that scratch really easily.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.160]   The G4 tube that cracked all over the place.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.160]   The Magic Mouse, which is the Stup- or the Mighty Mouse, which is the dumbest mouse ever designed.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.160]   Right?
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.160]   That's true, but it was nothing as designed.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160]   Yeah, but he was designed.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.160]   Those were designed things.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.160]   It was like the mighty, you know, you can't deny that the Mighty Mouse looks lovely, even though it doesn't work for Nookie.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   But the Apple Class Action lawsuit over the iPod Nano is scratching too easily and too much, right?
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.160]   I mean, that's a flaw.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   That's a major design decision that turned out to be a problem.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.160]   And they didn't ask Johnny Ive to leave.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   Right?
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160]   I think it's--
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.160]   Yeah, that's why I think it was probably a combination of things.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.160]   It was probably what you would.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   I agree.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   I absolutely agree.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   They could have gotten rid of him over the antenna gate thing.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   I think it was a lot more important and impactful for the company than the scratching iPods.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   And also, Johnny Ive, the example which you're taking.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:49.160]   He is so-- I would argue that he's a lot more important than Mr. Papermaster's company at this point.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.160]   They couldn't-- you know, we couldn't imagine them getting rid of Johnny Ive.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.160]   It would be almost like getting-- he's the second most important people person after dogs.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.160]   Oh, man.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.160]   No, I'm saying now.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   But when he designed the iPods that scratched or the G4 cube that cracked, he wasn't.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   He wasn't quite Johnny Ive yet.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   Yeah, but he made them look really pretty.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   That was interesting.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.160]   He didn't manufacture the materials.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.160]   He made them look really pretty.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.160]   And I think that's mainly his charter, to be honest.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.160]   So I'm trying--
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   An industrial can design encompasses more than that, but you know.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   Well, no, here, do I hear my Johnny Ive impression?
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:25.160]   Well, you know, if you've got to think about the material, right, and the material and the design of the same thing.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.160]   It's good.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.160]   I've been a good one.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160]   And that's not bad, actually.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   That's what he-- Jonathan Ive is above the materials.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.160]   He is all about this.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.160]   He's lost this, right?
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   And it's haircut.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   And it's just-- it works in a Jaguar.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   I got to say, he did not used to be that hot.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   That is somewhat of a recent development and good for you.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   He is industrial designed himself into a whole new level.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   They do.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.160]   Maybe all they needed to do was give Papermaster a makeover.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.160]   That was really sassy Molly.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   He designed himself.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.160]   That is magical, Johnny.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   Or maybe they just didn't like-- maybe they just didn't like meeting with him in person.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   Maybe they should have used Go to My PC.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.160]   Oh, you did not really--
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.160]   Oh, you did not really--
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.160]   I think he has some out.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.160]   That's nasty.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   Yeah, that's not lost in people.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.160]   The ladies and gentlemen is how it's done.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.160]   Ah, yes.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   For many of us, jobs aren't just from 9 to 5.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.160]   You got to work around the clock.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.160]   Whenever an idea comes to you, whenever you have a little spare time,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.160]   whenever you're inspired or motivated to do something,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.160]   you need to work on it, which means we don't have all of the files or applications we need right at our fingertips.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   If this sounds to you like the way you're going to work, you should try out.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.160]   Go to My PC.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.160]   Sponsor of Twit.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   Go to My PC means you can get what you need done whenever the mood strikes you.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   You can access your office or home computer and all the files and applications on it from anywhere,
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.160]   no matter where you are.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.160]   So try it out.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   Why don't you?
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.160]   For 30 days free.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.160]   I'm not saying it will save your career, but it can't hurt.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.160]   So check it out by going to go to MyPC.com/Twit
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.160]   and be able to access your files anywhere you go anytime.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   Go to MyPC.com/Twit.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.160]   We thank them.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.160]   Thank them for their support.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.160]   We thanks them for their support.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.160]   We do all kinds of things for their support.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.160]   We thanks them.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.160]   We always thank them.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   I don't think Go to My PC or anything would have helped HP CEO Mark Hurd.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.160]   Something is rotten at HP.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.160]   What is up with these people?
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.160]   So not only has he resigned over the sexual harassment investigation, but now there seems to be a little
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:34.160]   after bickering between HP and Hurd over exactly what happened.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.160]   When the announcement was made on Friday, it was, we didn't find any sexual harassment violations,
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   but he did violate policy.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   So he's going to step down and we're going to give him a severance package.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   But now on Twitter and elsewhere, there's been a little like he filed fraudulent expense reports.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   No, I didn't.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   This is turning out much worse for HP.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   This whole story is bonkers.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.160]   Like I love it for some reason.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.160]   I did hear no, I could not agree more.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   It's so ridiculous.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.160]   It's like there's this like fake sexual harassment claim and then every side just insists that
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.160]   they were just really good friends, right?
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.160]   Which is like at least have it be worth it.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   And so that even if there was a relationship that he is the CEO of HP and he can't afford
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   to conduct his own affair, that he would have to falsify expense reports that were related
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   to the cost of the affair.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.160]   Like dude, you can't pony up for your own hour long hotel room stays.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.160]   Like I don't understand.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   They were so surprised.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   They were doing it.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160]   They didn't need the app.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   They could just go get coffee.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   Well, and that's why he's.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.160]   That's the funniest part about this.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   That's the, well, he's a spouse.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   That he then expensed.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   Well, and that's the defense on his side is like, why would I do this?
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   It was because one of the controversies is she got paid for work that was never done.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.440]   He says, well, it's because, well, I don't know if he says, but that side says she was
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.160]   signed up for a contract that was canceled less than 30 days before it was supposed to
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.160]   start.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.520]   And that's normal terms for a contract is that you go ahead and get paid.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.440]   If you cancel less than 30 days, it's just a coincidence that it's this person.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.160]   So, you know, who do you believe?
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.400]   But now the Wall Street Journal is reporting, apparently, that people familiar with the
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.120]   situation, man, there's so many of those out there, tell the journal that heard and the
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:21.600]   unidentified contract or reached some kind of settlement over her charges, but that
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.440]   it didn't involve the exchange of money, but that there was, in fact, enough of an
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.960]   infraction that there was some sort of settlement.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.680]   But I, the other thing, and maybe this is.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   What kind of settlement doesn't involve money?
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.120]   Like, future jobs or like a diplomatic posting.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.120]   Just I was wrong.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.920]   Well, I was wondering if you look at it from the very like cut and dry, like, I'm a lawyer
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.040]   perspective, right?
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.880]   So I mean, to me, it just sounds like they had this weird relationship.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.760]   I mean, I'm just assuming that there is like some bump and grind going on because it doesn't
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.760]   make any sense.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.760]   Come on, there always is.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.560]   There's a whole to be, right?
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   Yes.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.320]   So, you know, but I think that there was, I sort of feel like there was, I mean, I'm
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.360]   not trying to, I don't want to be sound really jaded about the world, but like, this is the
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.240]   kind of thing that a CEO goes down for.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.320]   Like in this day and age, a CEO gets the boot over bump and grind in with a contractor
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.560]   and or kind of goofy expense reports.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.040]   Like something about this is super catchy.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   Okay.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   That's the official.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.920]   Here's my, here's my like my dry, like lawyer interpretation.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.320]   So they're like, they're fooling around.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   And then she wants something and can't get it.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.040]   So she says, well, I'll sue you for sexual harassment.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.480]   She calls the bluff.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.400]   She hires Gloria Allred, celebrity lawyer.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.560]   Gloria writes HP.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.440]   HP freaks out, right?
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.640]   Cause it's her CEO who's doubled their stock price since he's been the CEO.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.800]   They freak out.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.680]   They do their investigation.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.880]   They find that there's no sexual harassment because there's consensual activity going
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.160]   on where she is, right?
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   This is consensual.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:58.640]   So, you know, the harassment lawsuit holds in the water, but heard it has been essentially
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:05.080]   flying this contractor he hired around on HP's dime, you know, to just be friends.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.240]   And that's not okay, right?
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.400]   Because he's the chief executive of the company defrauding his company and bezeling money
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   from the company.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.960]   But Senator stay in office for that kind of thing.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.320]   That's the thing that I find so amazing.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.880]   Like, why does the center do something had that it should be allowed for everyone to
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   do it?
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.600]   I mean, for I would take the opposite, you know, view of this money.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.960]   I would say the senators should not stay in office.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.000]   Oh, no, no, yeah, I'm not saying that I approve.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.560]   I am saying that my jaded view of you.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560]   You did say that.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.560]   You just did.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.560]   No, come on.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.520]   What I'm saying is I can't believe that they let him go over this considering that he's
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.160]   doubled the stock price, considering that he actually brought them out from under the
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.800]   shadow of the Fiorina scandal, considering that, you know, all that he really did to
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:51.560]   turn around this company, the fact that he was then ousted over this, which I don't
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.520]   mean to suggest that it's really it's smell.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.520]   It seems to me.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.320]   I think there's more to it is all I'm saying.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   I think more.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   I think so.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.480]   He said we need you to leave and he said, no, I don't want to.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.080]   And they said there will be a lawsuit unless we settle this woman and you leave.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.480]   And I think that that's what drove it that whoever this woman is said, unless he leaves,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.600]   there will be a lawsuit.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:19.040]   And the last thing HP needs right now is a sexual harassment, like, high profile scandalous
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.600]   sexual harassment lawsuit.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.360]   So he leaves, she gets paid and HP gets to say things like we're upping our guidance
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.880]   for the third quarter.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.160]   And I think that's that was just the very cold, calculating move that they made.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.000]   They said, well, if you don't leave, she files and we don't want her to file.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.320]   So you have to go.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.800]   And that's what it sounds like to me.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.400]   And that's probably why he's so unhappy right now, because I don't think he wanted to leave.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.480]   I think he's he probably said what all he said, which is I'll pay you back.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.800]   There's I mean, who cares what I do with a few thousand dollars, like on the CEO, like
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.760]   I can fly whoever I want.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.960]   And I and check out my performance.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.600]   And I think that's why some of these rumbles of it didn't happen quite this way.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.400]   And there is this Ali insider story today that saying that that herds people are denying
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.880]   the things that the board of directors said.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.640]   So you may be right that the board forced him out and he is feeling like it's it's over
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.640]   the top.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.400]   There's an article on his statement is on the board, the PR that he put out, there's
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.480]   a statement from him being like, I didn't live up to these values.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.320]   And then 24 hours later, 48 hours later, he's like, you know, it turns out I did, which
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   is just strange.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   Well, there's a lot going in it.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.480]   Well, ever writers has an article where they quote Michael Malone who wrote the book,
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:35.240]   the HP way about how Fiona ran afoul of a lot of entrenched interests at HP during her
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.040]   tenure and was essentially forced out because she wasn't following the HP way.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.280]   And she complains that people at HP were resistant to change.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.320]   And now he thinks Malone, the author thinks that heard kind of ran afoul of that same
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.400]   culture and they're trying to reassert what's called the HP way.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.640]   And that is the sort of culture that was created by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard back in the
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   day.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.960]   And there's a lot of old timers still at HP who have momentum behind them.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.520]   And you see this happening companies where the person in charge can fall to the interests
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:12.200]   that are entrenched and almost like a meme, these sort of systems of thinking that perpetuate
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.680]   themselves over the decades and it just spits them back out.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.400]   And that may be what happened to her.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   There's a really interesting quote in this alley.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:25.680]   A story today saying that if if heard defrauded HP by submitting bogus expense reports to cover
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.160]   up a relationship or worse embezzled money by having the company fly his love interest
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.400]   around on the company dime, he should be fired for cause and not get a dime of severance.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:38.040]   Instead, he was let go with a package that is now costing HP shareholders $10 billion.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.560]   And so Ali, you know, the board of shareholders.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.000]   No, it's 12 million in cash.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.440]   And then another like 30 to 40 million there about spending the stock price when things
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.760]   vest in stock, right?
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.120]   And then, oh, and then 18 months to health and dental, just cause we have to be nice.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.320]   And then the, the, it's the stock price that fell, right?
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.560]   That's what it's saying is it's costing shareholders $10 billion total when to add in all the severance
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.840]   and the stock price drop.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.880]   So you do have to wonder if it is that HP way thing, like what the hell are the board?
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   What does the board do?
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:18.920]   Why? But so if you, we, we, we put up the, uh, the, the 8K, the SEC 8K that explains the,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.120]   the severance agreement and the reason he's getting the cash payment is that he's agreed
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.360]   to not sue HP in the future for wrongful termination.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.880]   But he didn't agree not to grumble about them on the internet.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:30.880]   Exactly.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.680]   So he's allowed to monitor as much as he likes, but that's why his name isn't connected
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.720]   deep closely to any of these reports.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.120]   That's why it's sources familiar.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.320]   People brief in the matter.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.240]   It's not Mark Hurd says I was fired for no reason.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.440]   HP made a wrong move.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.440]   I'm suing.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.160]   You know who a source familiar with the matter is Mark Hurd.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.360]   Probably the most familiar with this matter.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.680]   But I mean, but again, you know, sure, you know, it's, it looks bad.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:01.480]   You know, I think my, um, aggrieved headline on Engadget was, uh, HP CEO Mark Hurd rewarded
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   with $40 million severance package for harassing contractors or something.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.360]   And it's like, it definitely feels wrong that he's being paid to leave after defrauding
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.840]   his company.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.920]   But from HP's perspective, a lawsuit here would have been even worse.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.920]   Right.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.720]   I know having the former CEO for termination, that's bad.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.960]   And that's going to depress the software even further.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.640]   So I mean, this really feels like HP is cutting its losses and just trying to move on.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.360]   They're just like, here's the money.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   So very happy.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.360]   Here's some money.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   Please shut up.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   Okay.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.360]   And like that's what it sounds like to me.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   And I really want to.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.560]   That would only work if he actually did it.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.840]   If he was actually very like, he was clearly guilty of what he's being accused of.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.800]   So then him then coming and saying, I did nothing wrong is sort of strange.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   Okay.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   Molly, you won me over.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.240]   I think there's something fishy.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.360]   Something else.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   Thank you.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.560]   I think he did something wrong, but not as wrong as HP is making it out to be.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.160]   And so that's why you're getting the grumbling, not the outright protest, but the grumbling
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.760]   of like, this is making me look worse than it should have.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.560]   Because I really didn't do that.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.040]   What's wrong?
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:14.720]   So my, again, my shady interpretation here is that she threatened a lawsuit and to erase
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.160]   the possibility of the lawsuit and to get her to settle and be quiet, they had to fire
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:25.200]   him and to get him to not sue them for wrongful termination after he was fired.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   They had to pay him a severance.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.840]   I feel like I think we should write the movie version of this.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.600]   You don't think a multinational company the size of HP can make her go away, can settle
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.600]   out of court.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.560]   You know, I mean, I just don't, I cannot imagine a world in which the lawsuit is that damaging,
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.040]   especially since now, apparently now there's this breaking news like she has come forward
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.760]   and said, you know, I'm really sorry that he got fired and we didn't have sex or any
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.400]   other form of intimate relationship.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.320]   And I did not have sex with that CEO.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.880]   This just popped up on Twitter.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.640]   What would be your Hollywood movie conclusion to that story?
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.640]   I'm curious.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:05.160]   What would you imagine is going to happen if this is a movie?
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.840]   The conclusion, well, hopefully they run away and live happily ever after not having sex
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   or whatever.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.680]   They're going to, they're going to walk the Appalachian Trail together.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.280]   Yeah, maybe they're just going to go, they're going to go have like a monk like life together.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.280]   I don't know.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.520]   This is a New York Times story, right?
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.140]   I'm seeing it on Allie Insider, but yeah, it's like Jody Fisher appeared in a number of
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:33.000]   steamy movies, including "Shear Passion and Intimate Obsession" so she can play herself
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   in Patrick's movie.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.760]   I said, I was prepared for those events, worked very hard and enjoyed working for HP.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.640]   I was surprised and saddened that Mark heard lost his job over this.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.400]   That was never my intention.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.920]   I have a feeling that Tom may be right that there was something and if that's true, if
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.880]   the board kind of used this as a reason, like the big stick to lever him out of HP, then
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.480]   I sort of think that they have not done right by their shareholders because it's cost them
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.060]   a lot of money and also this guy was by all accounts a successful CEO.
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:07.100]   Now, if even her is coming out saying that's not what I wanted, it probably means she wasn't
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:12.900]   going to sue, which means again, there's something fishy and HP wanted to get rid of
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.900]   him.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:14.900]   I mean, it's getting super interesting.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.980]   It is and it's also evolving literally by the second.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.140]   Like we'll probably have another update by the end of the show.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.140]   This is great.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.140]   She's a political science major from Texas Tech University.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.420]   So she has a degree in polycy was vice president of a commercial real estate committee worked
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:31.360]   on the house select committee on narcotics abuse and control.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:37.260]   Before she went to HP and she's been an actress in our rated movies, says New York times,
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.660]   our rated movies and actress identified in the HP scandal.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.800]   Well, NBC television show agent plot.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.980]   So this I haven't seen this.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.080]   This man, this is where I just keeps getting better better.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   It does.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:54.480]   He's going to keep typing with his right hand for a gadget now.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.920]   I mean, but I think she probably she was sorry about this.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.880]   Why did she file a sexual harassment claim?
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.880]   Because I think she was totally intending for this to go the horrible awful way that
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:09.280]   business as usual incidents like this usually go, which is she files a claim, HP pays her
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.120]   a bunch of money and she goes away.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.880]   I mean, I really believe that that was probably the plan, right?
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.600]   You want to get really conspiratorial.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.440]   I encourage you, sir.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.440]   Maybe.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.040]   I mean, I resolve my claim with Mark privately without litigation.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   Do you want to comment on it further?
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.040]   And so there was probably not.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.840]   I don't got a right and there was not going to be a giant giant lawsuit.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.560]   And then all of a sudden the board was like, I don't know.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.480]   These expense reports like a little irregular.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   You're out of here.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.480]   What?
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:40.600]   You know, it's just bizarre in a world in a world where expense reports are fraudulent.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.360]   I am in big trouble because I can never remember exactly how much the taxi costs.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   Like that.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   That's where it's coming from.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.760]   You're afraid that you're going to get out to.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.760]   I am there.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.280]   This is not a comfortable precedent for me.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:58.040]   I've been angling for my $12 billion severance from Engadget for a couple of days now.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.680]   Now you know, more and more suspicious.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.080]   Now you've got a how to.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.080]   That's right.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.840]   Ms. Fisher may be looking for work.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.640]   You know, the the Blahapiri story for a soft core actress to come to dinner with me a
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.960]   few times a week in my reported act.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.880]   The boys at everybody's interest age.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.880]   Give me a call.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   No sex necessary.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.880]   You can't find them.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.320]   I close and then, you know, we'll see how it goes.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.240]   This is making the Blackberry story pale in comparison.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.240]   I am DB.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.240]   It's amazing.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   She was like, so stockings.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   That is awesome.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.240]   93.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.240]   So stockings.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.240]   This story is glorious.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.400]   This is the best tech story to come along.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.560]   There needs to be a car wreck.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.560]   You're right.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.160]   Like that, like that, the Gizmondo guy.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.160]   Totally.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.760]   That's all we're missing.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.440]   Man, she should run away with the gizmo.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.640]   The bag of money that they uncover somewhere.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.480]   Yep, and hopefully some Coke.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   My co-op.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.480]   My co-op.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   Why not?
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   Well, because there's no sex.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   So it's going to be Coca-Cola.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   Right.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.840]   And I just want to read this like random IMDB because these titles are also good.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.560]   So we've got intimate obsession in 1992.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.320]   Soaks, stockings in 93.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.560]   Little Big League, just randomly in the middle there.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:12.800]   Body of influence to Dead by Dawn, sheer passion and blood dolls as Jody Cody.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.600]   Well, that's good because she's her name's Jody.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.880]   So she didn't, you know, she could respond naturally.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.880]   Oh, man.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.880]   This story.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.520]   This is like, you know, this is a stock that we don't run on a gadget.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.560]   It's like not important now, but it's so good.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   So juicy.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.160]   Seriously, Jason said, when did Twit turn into Access Hollywood?
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.160]   Seriously.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.160]   When did Tech News turn into Access Hollywood?
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   Oh, all right.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.920]   We'll talk about the blood theory thing now.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   Yes, in the middle.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.360]   She's going to be to make the Blackberry story as in this thing.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   Right.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   How is your challenge?
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   How are we going to sex this up?
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:50.440]   So Saudi Arabia has come to an agreement with Blackberry over allowing the service to continue.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:54.400]   They were threatening to get rid of it to block the messenger service, particularly
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.960]   of Blackberry and Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.040]   It was down for about four hours on Friday, then it came back up.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.440]   And now they say they've come to an agreement where Blackberry will run a server in Saudi
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.200]   Arabia or possibly provide some other kind of access.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.240]   The details are still sort of dribbling out.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.960]   But rim was really resistant to this.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.320]   Like right up to the day that Saudi Arabia said, no, it started with the United Arab
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.600]   Emirates saying they were going to do the same thing in October.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.440]   Then Saudi just didn't move up the deadline.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.360]   Almost two years ago, it started with India saying we are worried about the security implications
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.200]   of Blackberry as smartphones become more popular in this country.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.760]   Emirates were the first to put a deadline on it and say by October, we're going to shut
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.000]   off all these services, right?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.040]   No, but India put a deadline on it, but then I will just say that the Indian infrastructure
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.800]   and the bureaucracy there deadlines don't mean a lot.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.160]   So there was a deadline and an interim long time.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.840]   Rim was like, oh, that's an Indian deadline.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.320]   Forget about it.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:56.560]   But the Saudi deadline became the worst because it came within a few days of Saudi Arabia saying
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.640]   we need messenger service blocked.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.960]   Unless we can get a tap, Rim said, it's encrypted end to end.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.240]   We don't have the keys.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.880]   We couldn't give you the data if you wanted.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.480]   Now it turns out, oh, I guess we can operate a server.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.120]   And I guess we can give you access.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.320]   What's really going on in this story?
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.920]   I mean, what has Rim said that is not exactly true and what isn't here?
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.920]   Right.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   It sounds like it's still a little bit like--
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   I see what you're doing.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.640]   You're opening the door for making the story more interesting.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.560]   What is really going on?
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.120]   What's Rim's IMDP profile?
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.720]   How many episodes of Soak's talking says Rim been on?
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.640]   It does sound like Rim has caved a little bit.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:39.740]   I mean, one suspects and has suspected all along that the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:44.400]   really saying what we want is the ability to monitor traffic on these networks.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.200]   And that Rim has said, sorry, our security is too good.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.240]   We're encrypted end to end and we store the data offshore and that's the deal.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:58.960]   But that they have maybe now said, yeah, we want to remain the global language of business,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   if you will.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.160]   And so, OK, we'll put some servers in your country.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.400]   I think Rim was also gambling on the business community in these countries, putting pressure
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.400]   back.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   And that's why they played it right up to the deadline.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.920]   Because the folks who do business in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, now Kuwait,
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:20.640]   Indonesia has made some-- or I think of a Singapore maybe has made some remarks that they are
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.600]   interested in having some sort of situation like this.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.880]   The business users don't want these services blocked.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.880]   They don't want their email blocked.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.880]   They don't want their web blocked.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.240]   They don't want messenger blocked.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.480]   And it didn't work out that way.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.560]   So they kind of had their bluff called, it sounds like.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   I think they did.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.440]   But this is a structural issue for Rim.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:44.200]   This is the way Blackberries work is that you have a server that the authorities can
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.240]   look at and say, well, all the traffic is going through that server.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.000]   We want access to that server.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.120]   And they can't say that to Google.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.760]   They can't say it to Microsoft.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.040]   They can't say it to Apple.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.440]   They can't say it to Nokia.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:00.240]   Because none of these countries run-- or companies rather-- run a single server where
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.400]   every phone connects to it and all the traffic is routed through this network of servers.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:09.120]   And that is both the strength and the weakness of the Blackberry design, where you have the
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.480]   BBM server, where you have the BIS server for the consumers.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.640]   And then you have the enterprise servers that are in businesses.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.600]   Well, when you have all Microsoft system, every business has its own exchange server.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:28.760]   And so it's harder for the UAE or Indonesia to say, we need access to all of these servers.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.760]   But with Rim, they can say--
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.960]   and they can say, we want access to your central BIS server for all your consumers.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.840]   And we want access to the BBM server.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.080]   Well, and it's good that Rim--
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.480]   The good thing about this is that even if Rim did cave a little bit, they didn't cave
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.280]   all the way.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.960]   And they did not give them access to those centralized servers, which would have comprised
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.000]   a lot more data than just the people who are using those phones inside those countries.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.280]   I mean, it may be that this is just going to mark a C change for Rim, that they can't
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.680]   necessarily operate in such a, I guess, kind of a cloud way, that they are going to have
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.160]   to be willing to operate more local servers.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.240]   But it makes me wonder what-- because this ban applied to foreign travelers as well.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.720]   And it makes me wonder what the global business marketplace is going to have to say.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:13.400]   Are they going to say, I actually don't want to use my blackberry and Saudi Arabia now
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.480]   because they can monitor my data.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:20.080]   And this is the thing, which is why didn't Rim say from the beginning, oh, well, we could
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.880]   set up a server in Saudi Arabia.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.280]   Why did they dig their heels in?
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.560]   I mean, you're right, Nielai.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.880]   This is what got them in trouble.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.120]   The fact that they run a centralized server-- I mean, we've seen the same thing with P2P
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.120]   services.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.120]   You run a centralized server.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.560]   You become responsible for all that data, and you have to answer for it.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.480]   When it looks like the answer here was to take one of those servers and put it in the
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   country.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.560]   Why didn't they come out with that at first?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.040]   Maybe it was the cost thing.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.840]   They didn't want to incur the cost of having a server and maintain it.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.360]   And apparently, this country-- and, sorry, maybe they have to put a server in each of
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:01.840]   them to have them independent and not have the Saudi government spying on the UAE server.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.240]   They're going to have to have one server in each country.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.760]   And then they were thinking, man, if every country is going to start demanding that they
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.600]   have a specific infrastructure for them, it's going to snowball.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   So I don't know.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:19.640]   And also, I mean, security is-- Rim is very proud of how secure Blackberries are, and
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.040]   for good reason, right?
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.400]   And so as soon as they start chipping away at that armor and saying, well, your Black
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.120]  berries end in secure in the United States.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:32.240]   But as you travel throughout the world, different people can look at your traffic.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.640]   That really takes away from the bulletproof Blackberry image.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:41.120]   And I can see what-- and Rim is a very conservative and very slow-moving company when it comes
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.960]   to things like that.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.840]   It's funny to me that, for example, the Blackberries were now-- it's the best phone to do email
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   on, still, to this day.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.600]   And it doesn't do eye map.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.040]   Like, it's bonkers.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.920]   The best email phone in the world doesn't support the world's most widely used email standard.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   Why?
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.840]   Because they want you to go through Blackberry internet server and get that experience, because
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   they're very proud of it.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.360]   And they think it is a better experience.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.320]   I don't think they want to start chipping away at what they consider their foundational
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   strengths.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.800]   And one of those foundational strengths is security.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.320]   Well, they didn't want to, but now they have.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.720]   I mean, I think it's true that they were holding out as much as they could, but now
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.680]   they have, and it's a slippery slope, and it's going to be a true result.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:22.440]   And now Kuwait has said they want Rim to block pornographic websites.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.120]   And then we know the United Arab Emirates still wants blocking.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.720]   And Lebanon has spoken often said that they're going to consider this.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:32.160]   So there's a snowball effect that's happening, which is going to make Blackberry seem like
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   the least secure.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.480]   And that's what you're pointing out here.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.120]   Is there a more secure alternative to Blackberry given all of this?
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.240]   Well, right.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.240]   So you can't go to Apple and say, we want the iPhone to block pornographic websites in
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.240]   Kuwait.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.960]   You have to go to the carrier, right?
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   And that makes sense.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.200]   So there's no uproar when we hear about Kuwait's national carrier blocking websites or snooping
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   on traffic.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   It's a smaller up or anywhere.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.840]   Because people say, oh, well, that's Kuwait.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.080]   That'll set in Saudi Arabia, it's snooping on traffic on the iPhone, because we know what's
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.120]   happening because it's not on the device.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.360]   With Rim and with Blackberry, there's that server.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.080]   And it's the focal point for everyone, because now Rim is operating the service and they can
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.560]   do things to their users.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   It's very clever.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.320]   And because that server exists, I mean, it's a structural issue for them.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:24.440]   So what happened in the past week at all of a sudden made everyone absolutely need to
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.560]   look into the Blackberry messages?
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.800]   I think Rim Caved.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.880]   Well, it started with the Emirates asking for kind of throwing down the gauntlet, saying
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   we're going to block this stuff.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.880]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.760]   Why did because Blackberry has been operating everywhere for a long while, why did today,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.240]   you know, all of a sudden they needed to look at everything?
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.240]   Right.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.240]   Maybe they just figured it out.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.560]   Maybe it was some grand strategy to realize, hey, you know, if we could get local servers,
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.280]   I mean, it might have been just a problem that they just now got around to, or they
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   just thought of the solution.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.000]   I mean, it seems very clever.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.680]   In some ways, it's sort of a coordinated attack on, as Niele put it, Niele put it, the Blackberry
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:03.880]   infrastructure, the basic fundamental operation of Blackberry.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.280]   And now there's a huge hole in the side of that ship.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.760]   Maybe the other countries are investing in Apple, and they want to sink Rim.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.760]   Right.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.800]   Well, I wouldn't say that Apple is the most secure way to do a phone call, though.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.760]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.760]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:39.760]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   the reclassification is the only way that the FCC can act under the scope
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.760]   of the current powers, and they do, in fact, have the ability to re-regulate
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   like that, I mean, that is what they're empowered to do, they can say,
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.760]   "We're changing the service from this to this."
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.760]   But Congress was up in arms, I mean, Republicans, Democrats, they encountered
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.760]   a ton of resistance to re-regulation, that I think they really weren't expecting, I mean, they were,
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   you know, senators, House representatives, all kinds of groups that you would
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.760]   other, even Google, which you would think might be in favor, was pretty
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.760]   tepid on the idea of re-regulation. I don't think that they have, I don't think
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.760]   the FCC has the support for that that they were hoping they would have, and I feel like
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.760]   they'll probably back away, and they're hoping that the marketplace in the form
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.760]   of these kind of backroom deals between maybe Google and Verizon will figure it out,
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.760]   but what I think is that wireless is going to be abandoned in terms of the next
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.760]   battleground, wireless is going to be left to be tiered, you know, to hell and back.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   Can I say this story scares the bejesus out of me?
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.760]   Seriously, I've been hearing, I'm sorry.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.760]   Yeah, that was French.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   Exactly. But I've been hearing more and more people going from, you know,
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:55.760]   net neutrality is important, and, you know, it's one of the founding principles of the
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.760]   Internet, and it's really important not to abandon it.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.760]   With this story, all of a sudden, first of all, Google being sort of, we don't really know
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.760]   what they've been talking about, and then, well, maybe if it's, you know, only for
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:13.760]   certain general types of files, and you don't discriminate the specific company,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.760]   or if it's only for wireless, then it's okay.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   I think Cooley was saying, well, maybe the business could figure it out,
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   and, you know, freehand of the market will do something perfect with all of this.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:31.760]   How can people, I'm sorry, I'm going into a little bit of a rant here, but how can people,
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.760]   of a sudden, be abandoning net neutrality like this?
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   It's horrendous.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   The idea that we can start with maybe wireless, and maybe video, maybe, no,
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.760]   we cannot go down that road.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   And this is one of the places where we absolutely, absolutely need regulation.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.760]   We don't need the FCC to get hands off, and to start saying, well, we're not going to
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.760]   be talking about it, and we don't need tech journalists to start thinking maybe businesses
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   are going to be taking care of this, because whatever we decide on now is going to be
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.760]   the foundation for what happens later, and we don't know what we're going to need later.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:14.760]   The Internet evolves so fast because we have no restrictions, and we get innovation,
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.760]   and you'll know that.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.760]   But I was terrified at the reaction to the story, and I'm certainly very happy that you
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.760]   guys here to be saying that, you know, maybe we should actually protect it and fight for it.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:32.760]   I was quite confused by this entire story until I read Schmidt's quote, and then I realized
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.760]   that fits in where I have been uncomfortable with net neutrality is the idea that we take
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.760]   away management tools from network administrators.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.760]   You can write net neutrality laws in a way that would really be bad for the Internet,
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.760]   and would be bad for bandwidth.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.760]   And so what Schmidt seemed to be saying was, quality of service, we don't discriminate
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.760]   on content by content type, because if your email gets delayed by a few milliseconds,
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.760]   you'll never notice.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.760]   But if your video gets delayed, you start to notice, and if your voice gets delayed,
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.760]   you really know.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.760]   But he also won't.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.760]   That doesn't work, Tom.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.760]   That doesn't work.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   You start with video, and you say, "Okay, the Internet today, we need video to be delivered
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.760]   fast," and that's the state of the Internet in 2010.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.760]   But what happens when some other sort of data transmission starts to, you know, some guy
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.760]   in his garage imagines that we're going to make, I don't know, a bit torrent, for example.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   Then the IASG is allowed to adapt to that.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.760]   It says, "You don't write it into the law, that this is what you can prioritize."
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.760]   But you do say, "Look, you can prioritize by content type, not by content or liver."
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.760]   That way?
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.760]   It's too stoy to say.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760]   It's okay to...
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:43.760]   The FCC has put forward is the ability for network operators and ISPs to manage their networks.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   I don't think the FCC has ever said, "We want to legislate or regulate how you manage
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.760]   your network or how you deliver quality or service to your users."
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:58.760]   What they're saying is, "We don't want you to prioritize certain content from certain
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.760]   providers over others."
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.760]   We want you to manage your network in a way that's failing.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:10.760]   If it's not fair, we want there to be some sort of process or litigation that will resolve
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   the issue.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   We want to say, "These are the rules.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.760]   You have to be fair."
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.760]   Then you can do whatever you want under the rules.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.760]   If you don't do them, the agreed-for-party can see you.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.760]   The thing I think we need to...
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.760]   The thing I think we need to watch out for, though, like you said, Patrick, in terms of
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:31.760]   the future precedent is that wireless broadband is considered even by the FCC to be the savior
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   of broadband access in America, that it's going to solve the last mile problem that in the
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   future, most of us will consume our data over wireless networks and not as much over wired
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760]   networks.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   That's the new infrastructure.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   That's the new battleground.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:50.200]   I think that Google is absolutely about to sell us down the river when it comes to tiering
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.200]   wireless networks because the telcos are holding all the cards for us and Sprint, AT&T, can
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.160]   say, "We're just not going to build out our wireless broadband networks.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.760]   We're not going to build out that infrastructure to save you all from the coming bandwidth crunch
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:07.400]   unless we have a guarantee that we can prioritize traffic as we see fit and that we can charge
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.480]   for that traffic as we see fit."
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:14.480]   So let me just...
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:20.480]   I think that's incredibly poignant and I think you've got it nailed.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:27.480]   And let me build on that because I think Verizon and Google right now have a very close relationship
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.800]   with Android and what they're doing with Android.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:35.280]   And I think Google, when we bring this back to the top of the show, one day the iPhone
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:40.320]   is going to be on Verizon and if Google already has a relationship to prioritize traffic to
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:46.360]   Android devices from Google services on Verizon's network in place, the Android phones will
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.960]   always be more attractive than the iPhone on that network.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960]   And you can't trust these...
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.680]   I mean, the reason that this became an issue with Comcast and Time Warner is that they
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.720]   started getting into content delivery.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.760]   They had a conflict of interest when it came to their competing services because on the
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.960]   one hand they were providing the pipe but on the other hand they were providing content
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.680]   that they wanted to get through the pipe more quickly and that's why their tiering became
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.640]   so unnerving.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.480]   The same proposition exists with the telcos and the same proposition like you point out
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.560]   Neelai exists with Google.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:20.240]   They are in a position to want to prioritize not only traffic in the form of YouTube video
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.080]   but traffic to specific devices in the form of Android devices and don't think for a minute
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.280]   that Google is going to hold on to the vaunted neutrality principles when it comes to increasing
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.320]   market share in both of those arenas.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:35.280]   There's a story kicking around that those data center containers that Google has had for
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:42.000]   years and years and years might be placed near Verizon data centers and Google would
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.960]   pipe directly into the Verizon network so it would never go out on the open internet
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:51.320]   if you're in Verizon and they would be able to subvert any net neutrality regulation anyway.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.000]   So this has made me cry a little.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   This is...
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   I mean, that's crazy.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.760]   So basically this is the reason why you have so many workarounds and loopholes and ways
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:09.040]   that the people talking in secret rooms can circumvent what the law is that you shouldn't
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:14.760]   say, okay, you can do things in a fair way in these different sort of, you know, special
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.760]   cases.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.520]   What you have to do to preserve the internet people, this is important.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.840]   We're not talking about YouTube and videos of cats only the internet.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.720]   In order to preserve it, you need to say you cannot prioritize anything and managing your
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.280]   network is another way of saying you can do whatever the hell you want.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.280]   And we should...
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   I don't agree with that part of it.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280]   Actually there was that internet too.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.280]   Remember when we first...
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.480]   There's more to the internet than you are.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.960]   Remember when we first started talking about net neutrality years ago and internet too was
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.360]   conducting all those tests and they actually found that network management didn't have
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.480]   to include prioritizing certain amounts of traffic.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.080]   They released that study that said we think that if you provide sufficient bandwidth,
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.960]   you don't have to do QOS monitoring and you don't have to do that kind of packet level
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.040]   management to ensure that data, you know, video travels better voice.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:06.760]   I had this argument, that exact argument with the network administrator at the University
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:12.520]   of Chicago, my freshman year of college in 1999 saying there's sufficient bandwidth on
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.520]   our network.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.760]   I don't know why you're shutting down the abstract.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:17.440]   And the internet I was...
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.680]   In that conversation I've been having in one form or another since I was a freshman in
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.680]   college.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.960]   And I think it's exactly right.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.520]   You know, if there's enough bandwidth, you can just do whatever you want.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.200]   The issue is that wireless networks don't have enough bandwidth.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.400]   And the reality is we need to allow those operators to manage their networks.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:37.400]   And it's the balance that I think right now we're seeing the pendulum swing wildly between
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.400]   two extremes.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:42.840]   The ACC says you're a title two service, we're going to regularly like the traditional
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:47.480]   online telephones, everybody has to be neutral and then, you know, there's some pushback
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.240]   and pendulum swings wildly to Google and Verizon making a deal in secret in the back
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.240]   room.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.240]   And we just need...
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.760]   The oscillation has to stop at some point.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.800]   Yeah, the problem is we actually don't know what that agreement was.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.000]   We only know what it wasn't.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.720]   Google and Verizon very specifically said no, we did not come to any kind of agreement
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:11.240]   about allowing prioritization of Verizon or Google content on the internet.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.320]   They specifically came out on that, which is unusual in these situations.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.200]   Usually you get sort of some kind of vague plausible non-denial denial.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.600]   So we know that wasn't part of it, but we don't know what they did agree on if they
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.000]   agreed on anything.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.080]   And we also know that the stories, the Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.600]   stories are still out there and have not been corrected or amended by those outlets.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.920]   I mean, that doesn't necessarily say it all, but the fact that the New York Times did not
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.760]   issue a correction after being flatly contradicted by Verizon and Google, I thought, was also
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.760]   interesting.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.040]   I would not say we're backing away from the story or even issue a clarification.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:51.600]   So we have wired communications, not wire line as Neil I pointed out, but wired DSL
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.560]   and Fios on the one hand and the idea of whether we need quality of service management
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.960]   on that or not.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.080]   And then we have wireless communication, which even though we've been talking about it in
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.720]   relations to quality of service, everything we've talked about has said, well, wireless
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.360]   no net neutrality up for grabs.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.440]   And Molly pointed out that's where it gets really scary.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.880]   And what I would like to add to that is what's really interesting is wireless, the FCC can
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.560]   regulate a lot more easily than wired because it's a scarce resource that is managed by
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560]   the FCC.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.360]   It's one of the reasons the FCC exists is to manage that spectrum that wireless exists
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.360]   in.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.080]   So is it because the FCC just thinks we'll get to that later?
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.920]   I think the FCC is is this is what I said on Buzz that lot.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   I think they're pretty neutered.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:40.040]   I mean, I think that they are backing away a little bit from reclassification.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.440]   I think that they've been gutted by that Comcast ruling.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.200]   And I think they don't have the administrative and congressional support that they thought
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.400]   they would have for exerting those regulations because they're such an intense, you know,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.320]   when net neutrality became a partisan issue, it became a lot harder for the FCC to say,
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.680]   this is about managing a crucial resource for America, which is what they were trying
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.840]   to say with broadband plan, but they were undercut at almost every turn.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.840]   And I go ahead.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.240]   I really agreed with their title to reclassification.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.840]   I thought that their proposal that the FCC put out and the way they wanted to do it made a
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.040]   lot of sense, right?
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:21.800]   Because the best way to do something administratively and politically is to utilize the power that
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:26.240]   you already have and to go out and try to seek new power is always a bad idea because
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   somebody will challenge your ability to have that authority.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.080]   For the FCC to say, well, here's the authority that we have.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.560]   We're going to organize a way to use it as responsibly as possible.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.400]   And we're going to do what we're tasked to do made a lot of sense to me.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.880]   And, you know, it didn't matter what they said, right?
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   They could have said anything.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.240]   They could have said, you know, we're going to go back to Congress and ask for a bill
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:51.720]   giving a specific authority to regulate the internet in an actual way.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.160]   And they still would have gotten pushed back from the industry.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:00.600]   And I think it's the vociferous lobbying from the ISPs, from the carriers, who that's
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600]   pushing them back.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.520]   It doesn't matter how they try to do it.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.400]   I think that's really the problem that the FCC is going to have to solve.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.440]   They really need to get some political capital.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:14.520]   And they really need to find a way to sell their side of the story in a way that, you
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.080]   know, once you've got Google and Verizon signing a deal in the back room and even talking about
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.560]   it, once you've lost Google is a proponent of neutrality, you've really lost a lot.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.480]   I mean, I think they need to start running a university support.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.480]   I think research support, all this other stuff that they need to do because they don't have
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.720]   the political capital to push neutrality through right now.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.720]   And that's scary.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720]   This week I wrote.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.280]   I think the title to reclassification was a good plan.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.680]   And, you know, Molly, I'm maybe more of an optimist than you.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.680]   I hope so.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.680]   Stupid.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.160]   I mean, I hope you're right.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.280]   You know, I wrote the most depressing column this week that I've ever written.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.440]   I wrote net neutrality is dead on wireless networks as a Molly rant because it was, you
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:02.240]   know, it seemed to me that the tone of all of this was Google and Verizon are cutting
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:05.120]   a deal to exempt wireless networks from net neutrality.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.120]   And it is going to influence.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.600]   Well, it's just wireless network.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.360]   Well, that's just that's the thing.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.200]   That's how it starts.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.960]   Well, no, it's a good point though because we actually have competition to the death.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.000]   We actually have more competition in wireless networks than we have in wired, at least
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   for the moment.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   For the moment.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.280]   We don't have that issue in wireless networks in France.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.040]   They're working fine and we're getting video and everything.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.880]   The solution is not to restrict the amount because if you give the power to restrict
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.560]   the way data is funneled, then they're never going to expand.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.120]   They're always going to say, well, you know, our network is too small and we can't handle
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.120]   that kind of bandwidth.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.040]   But they're not going to tell without it either.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.280]   I think that they are saying, I think what they're saying right now is there is no way
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.760]   in hell that we are going to build out our mobile broadband infrastructure subject to
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.400]   the same restrictions that the wired carriers have had to deal with and they're no way.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.040]   They're building for the they're building for the they're already doing it.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.280]   I think they are building for sure, but they want to make sure that they are in control
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.080]   before they before they're willing to say we don't have the network scarcity that, you
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.680]   know, because right now they're falling back on network scarcity as it's free market.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.320]   Once one of them has a proper for G network, the other ones are going to have to follow
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.000]   its competition.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.560]   I love that the French men's defending the free.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.040]   No, it brings a tear to my eye.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:30.480]   No, I wish I believed that that actually worked as much as you believe.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   Wow.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.080]   This is actually the world.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.640]   They are doing it.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.320]   Who is it who has a 4G network?
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320]   It's in it.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.920]   Yes, with the clear wire from partnership has a YMAX 4G network.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.920]   Right.
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:51.600]   But you know, I talk about competition and why I was trying to work all the time because,
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:56.920]   you know, this is an age old battle between people who have an access layer and a content
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.160]   layer, right?
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:04.560]   And it's like everybody who's sort of like us, the nerds of the world, they know that
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.280]   what you really want is a dumb pipe.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.560]   And that's all that anybody should really want, right?
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.680]   And that's there should be competition between different dumb pipes over who is the fastest
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.880]   and most reliable.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.640]   The problem is that all of it's like they're arrogant or they're pretentious or something
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.120]   and they believe that they should be more than dumb pipes.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.920]   The Verizon wants to run an app store and have a media service and all this other stuff
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.600]   to differentiate their dumb pipe.
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.960]   And it's like they don't realize the best differentiation for their service would be
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.480]   being faster and more reliable, potentially at a cheaper price.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.120]   And if they competed on those metrics, I think we'd all be better off.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:44.440]   If we had more choices, they would be competing on those metrics.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.800]   But the problem is most people have but two choices, sometimes only one.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.800]   Right.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   And it may be the case.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:56.160]   And we do in fact have more competition among wireless carriers than we do among wired,
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.840]   but even that isn't saying much because the iPhone is still not available in two of the
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.200]   three states that I lived in most recently because I don't have three G there.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.200]   Right.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.680]   And the moral of Detroit isn't available on AT&T.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.840]   And when you do sign up for one of these phones, you sign a tier contract.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.760]   So the subscriber base isn't mobile.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760]   And you know, it's not.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.320]   So you guys, you guys, what the solution is, right?
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.800]   I got to go back to my socialist, French self here and I'm going to make Tom happy.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:29.000]   You need government mandated wireless network covering the whole country that provides the
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.960]   minimum service so that I'm Tom, like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you are talking crazy,
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   my friend.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.120]   Well, that was part.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.720]   I mean, that was part of the hope of the national broadband plan that they would actually be
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:47.080]   able to mandate to enact actual competition via a variety of methods in one of them just
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.520]   being simple metrics, you know, finding out what was available where and at what cost
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.800]   and really bringing transparency into the debate and then hopefully, you know, freeing
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.800]   up spectrum and they had all the all of these steps that were hopefully going to increase
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   competition.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.760]   But now they have just backed off.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.920]   It's they like they have thrown up their hands and they've said, you know what, you guys
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920]   work it out.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.920]   We're just going to be over here.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:08.920]   We're tired.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.320]   So what does that not make you happy, Tom?
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.720]   What's the problem in that in that idea?
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.320]   Because your situation now is so much better.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.800]   No, because I will.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:21.740]   Yeah, because our wireless situation is the one hope when with because you can have a choice
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:25.040]   of five or six different providers instead of one or two.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.240]   And then you can have a free market work where people say, you know what, actually, I'm going
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.240]   to choose Sprint.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.240]   I'm going to choose Metro PCS.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.000]   I'm going to choose somebody else because I don't like the restrictions I'm getting
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.840]   and you don't have to have anybody come in and put a regulatory hand on it.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.160]   I think there's a better chance of it working.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:46.440]   That is never going to work, especially in wireless because when you're when you're
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.240]   taking a wireless service, you expect it to work in different parts of the country.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.680]   And if you have segmented different providers, they're not going to be working everywhere
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.920]   or they're going to be more expensive.
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.640]   I mean, wireless networking, not working now.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.240]   What we're saying is it could be working in the future if it was done properly.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.120]   And you know, if things were done properly, BP would have spilled millions of gallons of
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.240]   oil in the in the message.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.480]   A slippery slope drink.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.840]   I call some derivation of Godwin's law involving oil.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.840]   Totally.
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.920]   You cannot go BP on us.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.320]   You cannot go.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.080]   Trains run on time.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.200]   You know, it's not going to matter because a huge ice sheet just broke off from Greenland
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.560]   and it's coming after us and we're all going to be eaten by a monster glacier.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.320]   Yeah, my version of Godwin's law now is just 2012.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320]   You know what?
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320]   Yeah, I'm pretty worried about that.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320]   2012.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.720]   You heard about that, the largest Arctic iceberg since 1962.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.720]   It's a little scary.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.720]   I'm saying theme park.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.720]   Ooh, fun.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.720]   Sliding galore.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.840]   Sloding theme park.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:54.520]   If they could deal with it in 1962, it's not like, you know, it was so long ago.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.880]   It can't have been that bad.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:56.880]   We would have heard about it.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.880]   I would have eaten a movie.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:01.320]   Well, I just went out and poured Lucky Strikes and Whiskey on it back then.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.680]   Melt of the dang thing.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.680]   It's true.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.200]   We don't have that kind of flame throwers.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   But any more.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:14.120]   All right, let's, let's, since we're talking about something ecological, let's talk about
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.440]   forward makers of the Ford EcoBoost engine.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.680]   Also a sponsor on Twitch.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:26.240]   It's a 3.5 liter twin turbocharged 365 horsepower V6 direct injection to increase fuel efficiency.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.240]   Ford has brought both the twin turbos and direct injection together in the EcoBoost
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.360]   to deliver the performance of a much larger engine with the fuel economy of a smaller
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.360]   engine.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.720]   It's the first engine of its kind in North America.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:43.040]   The first twin turbocharged direction injection V6 in North America and EcoBoost is standard
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.440]   on the new 2011 Taurus show with a Taurus SHO.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:51.960]   It has an EPA estimated fuel economy of 17 in the city, 25 on the highway and the Taurus
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.680]   show and most of the Ford cars also feature voice activated sync.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.280]   The in car connectivity system that gives you true hands free calling turn by turn voice
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.840]   directions without having to purchase additional hardware.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.600]   911 assist voice activated music and podcasting.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.320]   Your text message is read aloud so you can keep connected while keeping your eyes on
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.400]   the road and your hands on the wheel and so much more in voice activated sync.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:18.680]   You can check out both the Ford EcoBoost engine and sync by driving the Taurus show.
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.160]   The Taurus SHO at a Ford dealer near you.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:25.200]   Stop by a Ford dealer this week and drive one.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.240]   All right, this just broke actually.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:33.320]   A Best Buy has had privileged status as the only iPod seller according to New York Times,
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:38.600]   Robert Stevens, CTO and founder of its Geek Squad service, posted a couple prototype
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.600]   tablet photos on Twitter this week out of nowhere.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.280]   It's just an empty shell, but he says it carries Best Buy's rocket fish brand and it
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.360]   looks like Best Buy is going to have their own tablet.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.520]   Oh, like an insignia version.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.520]   Interesting.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.880]   It looks according to this New York Times story, a little like an HP slate.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.560]   Do you think that's what they did with them?
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.320]   You know, we have this hardware and we don't really know what to do with it anymore.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.320]   That would be interesting.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.320]   It wouldn't be surprising, I guess, if they did an insignia tablet.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:15.480]   Although as with all at this point, as with all tablet discussions, just call me when
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.480]   there are some.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.480]   Yeah, right.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.480]   Seriously.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.360]   Where are all of the iPad competitors?
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.080]   They're all in development and coming Q4.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.480]   So either we're all going to be buried under them in Q4 or we're just.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:30.800]   There was the one that sold out of Kmart, $150 tablet, Android tablet.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.800]   So we actually saw one.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.240]   Actually, people seem to like the Dell streak too, much to my surprise.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.240]   The streak has got a lot of.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.280]   It seems kind of like popular.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.440]   All right, you go Best Buy.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.520]   You make your insignia really at this point, anybody, anybody.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520]   Somebody.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.520]   Make damn tablet.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.360]   I am ready.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   Where's the Juju?
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360]   Oh, God.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:55.800]   We had two separate Juju's come in to see that and both of them failed.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   Just died.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   Both of them.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   Wouldn't even turn on.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.800]   Wow.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800]   Do you see that?
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.400]   Yeah, we had like 10% of the whole production run.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:09.000]   I think it was like more like 15% or Juju.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.400]   WikiLeaks this week came under fire from the Pentagon who minced no words in telling them
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.720]   they did not have any conversations.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:22.520]   They did not have permission and they asked them to return the classified documents.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:28.440]   We want our stuff back, which most people have been even boing boing have been very kindly
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.640]   posting as delete, even though he used the words return the documents because we're assuming
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:35.720]   the Pentagon knows that they aren't in a pouch.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.360]   I don't know if they know.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.280]   No, I think they think an envelope is headed their way.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:44.480]   They're digitized as much as the net neutrality story scares me.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:49.120]   This one makes me eat Lee laugh and it's extremely cute.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.200]   I love it.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   Please return.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.760]   Can you give that back because they actually they said I think in the in the in the letter
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.760]   that they said WikiLeaks they said delete and return.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:03.060]   Yeah, well, well, they're still trafficking in Jeff or Al the department's press secretary
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:08.200]   demands that WikiLeaks return immediately to the US government all versions of documents
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:11.280]   obtained directly or indirectly from the Department of Defense.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.320]   You know, to give them their credit, they may be meaning the original media upon which
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320]   you got this.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:20.080]   Yeah, whether it's an email or a USB drive or something so that they could do forensic
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:24.360]   analysis on it and try to trace where it came from because that's what they're up to is
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:28.560]   they're trying to find out how WikiLeaks got this stuff as well as asking them to take
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.560]   it down.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:34.180]   They've also banned the military from viewing WikiLeaks, which a lot of people have pointed
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.600]   out means that the terrorists can see WikiLeaks, but the military can't.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.920]   I think that's kind of silly.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.560]   And they've also they don't but our servicemen like don't need to be looking at WikiLeaks.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.880]   I think yeah, I think the people who are doing intelligence probably still have and are probably
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:53.000]   not banned and the military has a leveling system about classification and need to know
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.200]   and knowledge sharing.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.640]   And I think that it is perfectly reasonable for them to want to protect the classified
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.560]   structure by saying, look, you don't need to be reading WikiLeaks and finding out information
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.560]   that's above your pay grade.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.720]   I mean, that's just how the military works.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:08.080]   Although, yeah, the opposite side of that is that I can read it, but someone in the military
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.080]   can't.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.080]   So it's almost a false ban.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.160]   I mean, there's an easy way to get around it.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.560]   The cats out of the bag there.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560]   Yeah, true.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.560]   Of course it is.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:19.600]   But it's a very, it's a very cheap shot of saying, you know, the terrorists can look at
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.400]   it and the military can't.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   It's very cheap.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.480]   I mean, of course they're going to say, sorry, you guys shouldn't be looking at it.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:32.560]   But who knows what's happened, but they should still issue the order of you should look at
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.520]   it and it's above your secret level thing.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.440]   They probably shouldn't just be surfing the web at work.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.360]   It's probably more it's more like a Facebook ban in that way when you think about it.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.120]   Well, and then now there's this odd file that WikiLeaks has posted a mysterious encrypted
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.920]   file labeled insurance.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.600]   Did something happen to us open this file?
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   Dun dun dun.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   And apparently it's huge.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.560]   Yeah, it's a 1.4 gigabyte file with AES 256 encryption and lots of people have downloaded
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.640]   it.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.960]   Nobody can crack into it with that kind of encryption, not easily, not really at all.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.560]   But everyone suspects that, you know, if something should go down wrong or Julian assign
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.080]   should come up, you know, face up in the Hudson that keys would be released for people to
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.040]   unlock this file.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:24.800]   And my guess is it's everything else that they've gotten regarding Afghanistan because
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.560]   they've said there's lots of documents that they have received that they have not posted
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.720]   because they felt they were dangerous.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.960]   This is super scary.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:39.160]   I mean, this whole WikiLeaks, I've always been extremely supportive of WikiLeaks in general,
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:46.200]   but I have to say this story made me think, all right, wait a second, because these files,
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:53.000]   I mean, the insurance thing aside, the whole military correspondence for the war in Afghanistan,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.760]   I'm like, maybe there should be somewhat a way to control that.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.440]   Or maybe, I don't know, it just makes me question a little bit, we need to send.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.200]   I know it's a very important service to have.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:12.720]   It's a very important side, but it's like putting a light on how disruptive it can become.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.760]   It's almost an energy device kind of on our piece.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.040]   I mean, I think the question is really, it sort of feels like dogma is bad on either
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040]   side, right?
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.080]   On the on the military side, they're too secretive.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:29.920]   There's no question that the dogma of secrecy at all costs is dangerous, but openness at
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.840]   all costs may be equally dangerous.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.280]   And I think that's what we're finding out.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.960]   It's not, is it worth it?
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   Should there be some secrets that save people's lives for God's sake?
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.800]   You know, and is it worth it to protect those?
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:46.560]   You know, I don't want to get too crazy and philosophical here, but I've noticed recently
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:52.880]   that the sort of the culture of the internet, if you will, and the narrative that sort of
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:57.600]   the right-wing media in particular spins is that authority is not to be trusted and
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.560]   that systems and government have failed, right?
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:06.320]   And that sort of general anarchy, like Patrick is saying, is sort of the way to go, right?
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.760]   That government can't be trusted because it doesn't function and authority can't be
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.640]   trusted because it lies to you.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:16.720]   And it's kind of like WikiLeaks is that it is absolutely, I think, a paragon of this
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.920]   attitude where they say, well, you can trust us, but we don't know, you know, we don't
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.920]   have authority.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:22.920]   We're anti-authority.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.040]   And by being anti-authority, that's how we gain your trust.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.960]   But the fact of matters at WikiLeaks, just like our government and our military and every
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:36.040]   other institution is run by people and people have biases and opinions and they will selectively
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.480]   try to make you agree with them and persuade you.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.680]   And that's really the problem with WikiLeaks, is that they release information in a way
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.640]   that suits them and they don't release all the information and let everybody decide.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:52.040]   And so, I mean, that's my issue with WikiLeaks in general, is that they've put themselves
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.560]   in this position of saying, you know, the government isn't to be trusted.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.720]   They're not telling you everything.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.760]   But at the same time, they very actively don't tell you everything.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760]   You should be very--
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.760]   You should be very--
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:07.240]   In life and in politics and on the internet, you should be very suspicious of anyone who
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.120]   says, I'm right.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.520]   I am the one who's right.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.760]   Because that is almost never true.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.760]   You know, they're--
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   The message coming from me or Molly.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.760]   Yeah, yeah, mainly if it's--
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.560]   Damn it, you stole my joke.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.760]   But, you know, I mean, it's just a very good lesson.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.720]   It's that WikiLeaks is no less a true believer than anybody else.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:32.480]   They think that what they are doing is the only right way to go and they will not be
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.960]   persuaded by logic or safety concerns or anything.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.920]   Any time I think that your position is that extreme, you're just going to cause trouble.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.920]   Right.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:46.720]   And I think particularly with government, and maybe this is going to sound crazy coming
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:47.720]   from me, but--
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.560]   Wait, that's not going to sound crazy because we launched your audio.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.560]   It was so crazy.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.560]   It was so crazy.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.560]   It was too crazy.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.960]   The government wouldn't allow it out.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:58.960]   You self-muted.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:28:59.960]   No, no.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:04.440]   No, no, no, no, so particularly in the case of government, and I think this is going to
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:09.680]   sound odd for me because I'm not some crazy supporter of institutionalized government.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.840]   But government, you know, in America, you can get rid of, right?
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.520]   If the government does something wrong, the system is designed so that you can vote the
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.600]   bastards out, right?
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.320]   You don't get to vote out WikiLeaks.
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.320]   Like you don't--
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:26.960]   You know, they continue to be there and if they do something wrong, they're still there
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.480]   and they don't go away.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:34.400]   And so it's odd to me whenever we see private institutions come down and really demand that
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:38.000]   we take down the government in some way the way that WikiLeaks does because there's a
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.520]   check for the people on the government.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.080]   There's not a check on WikiLeaks.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.640]   And I think that's sort of an interesting dynamic that they've really used their advantage
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:49.360]   by saying we're the ones who are right and your government is not to be trusted.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:53.000]   Well, you point out an interesting fact here that WikiLeaks is taking advantage of which
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   is the infinite copyability of the internet, right?
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.600]   If it was just a marketplace of ideas and people got to shout them forth, some voices
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:05.800]   would be heard more than others and you'd be able to discern which one you want.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:10.920]   But on the internet, when you're talking about leaks, it takes one posting.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.360]   And so they have so much more power than the government in that way, which has to fight
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:21.480]   to stay elected and it's why you see so much crap in the rhetoric and so much ridiculous,
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.800]   you know, slippery slopes and all this thing to try to trick people into voting for them.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:29.040]   Because all WikiLeaks has to do to affect their agenda is post once.
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:32.200]   And then it is infinitely copyable from then on.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:37.000]   And because they're really a good at what they do, the narrative that they provide about
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.720]   the information that they leak is generally the dominant narrative until it's corrected.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.560]   But nobody cares about corrections, right?
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.320]   So to bring this back to sort of two subjects that I'm more familiar with and feel more
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.840]   comfortable talking about is an example of this phenomenon.
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.280]   One is, for example, the iPhone 4 antenna where everybody who sees my iPhone 4 to this
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:59.640]   day says, "Oh, do you drop calls when you hold it wrong?"
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.000]   And the answer is no, right?
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.360]   Because you don't drop calls when you hold it wrong, you lose some signal.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:08.160]   And that might, you know, it's like there's this whole other explanation now.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.560]   But the median narrative has been you drop calls when you hold it wrong.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:12.560]   And so that's out there.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.560]   It's forever.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.720]   An apple can't do anything to fix it.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:21.480]   Another one from just this week was Apple used some images in a patent application with
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.480]   a third party application.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.840]   Like an iPhone app, they used a screenshot and their patent apps.
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:31.400]   And the narrative immediately was Apple's trying to patent iPhone apps that other developers
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.280]   who have submitted to the app store.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.040]   And it's like, well, no, that's absolutely not true.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.720]   And I'll explain it to you.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.880]   But you know, it took me a day to put up that explanation.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.880]   And then it was over.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.640]   It was like, you know, there's one of those things where I was writing it.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:48.280]   I was like, I know this doesn't matter, but I want the right information to be out there.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.800]   And it's like those narratives take hold so quickly.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:56.200]   And especially because information, like you're saying, can be repeated so often and so quickly
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:01.120]   as soon as it's out there, it's almost as though they have, you know, an exponential
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:04.720]   amount more power over the median narrative than the government.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.520]   Because the government's income in quite frankly be boring, right?
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.160]   They're going to be like, well, that isn't actually the case.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.440]   We're not murdering civilians.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.760]   You know, here is this exercise and blah, blah, blah.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.760]   And nobody cares.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.680]   Well, the government's going to say it's not as black and white as you have portrayed
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:18.680]   it, WikiLeaks.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:19.680]   It's more nuanced.
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.240]   More complicated and no one likes to listen to that.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:26.880]   And the WikiLeaks side of the argument is if you want to be able to make a good judgment
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.240]   on government and find out who the bastards are, who you want to throw out, you need all
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.600]   the information, they're not going to give it to you.
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:34.600]   We will.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.840]   We will pass it along unfiltered.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.840]   You know, they don't.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.840]   Which also doesn't necessarily help.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:39.840]   They do filter it.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:46.000]   But you know, I think there is a good purpose behind something like WikiLeaks to say, hey,
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.560]   we want to get information out there that you need to know to understand how things work
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.120]   in your country.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.520]   But it has to be done responsibly.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.440]   And I think that's the conversation we're having here is, is WikiLeaks responsible?
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.280]   So should we trust them?
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:04.320]   Well, I think the, the, the, the, the, oh, sorry, go ahead.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.640]   I mean, just sort of quick things.
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:10.400]   What you're saying is, WikiLeaks needs to be more responsible.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:16.440]   So they need to take in all of this information that they're getting filtered out and explain
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.880]   what the government is doing.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.120]   That role is the role of the press.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:22.120]   Well, and they did that.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:27.240]   That's what's interesting is they passed that along to three news outlets, Der Spiegel, the
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.680]   Guardian, right?
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:31.920]   And the New York Times to do that for them.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.200]   Then they said, but we also want you to have the source information.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.840]   We want you to have the source material so you can double check the press.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.520]   Yeah, this is not the WikiLeaks is not supposed to be the press.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.520]   WikiLeaks serves a different purpose.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:50.000]   It's a place to post information anonymously, whatever that information may be.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.360]   And what we're seeing now, I believe, but we're realizing it's sort of a wake up goal.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:02.800]   We're realizing maybe this sort of no accountability possibility that we have now with the internet
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:10.440]   with a WikiLeaks, but other venues like maybe 4chan even, which no one can touch.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:16.000]   And it's sort of scary almost is that too much non accountability.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.640]   We obviously can't do anything about it at this point.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.680]   I don't think because if you strike down WikiLeaks, for example, something else will come up somewhere
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680]   else.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:30.720]   But it is sort of awe inspiring and a little bit too much maybe.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.120]   And that's what we're realizing now.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:36.760]   It's not the fact that we can actually edit or shouldn't edit the information that we're
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:37.760]   getting out.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.280]   It's the fact that you can't put out this information with and once it's out of the bag,
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.280]   it's finished.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.280]   That's the problem.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.000]   And is it really a problem?
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.720]   Is the question we should answer?
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:50.920]   I think that's the issue.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:59.200]   So every single day at Engadget, we get tips on new products or services or we get people
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.240]   send us in fake spy shots, all this stuff, right?
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:06.160]   And our readers rely on us to filter out the wheat from the chaff.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.800]   And sometimes we're right and sometimes we're wrong.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.640]   Sometimes we miss things.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:14.240]   But we have a good record and our credibility is based on that record and we work very hard
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.600]   to maintain it.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.000]   And I think what WikiLeaks does is they don't filter it.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.760]   And the way that they do filter is with these selective edits and the selective releases
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:31.720]   and the aura of anti-authority rebellion, and as soon as something is on WikiLeaks with
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:36.960]   all of that branding and I don't want to call it branding, but that reputation behind
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.280]   it, it gains some status.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:45.440]   And so this goal of you can just submit information for the commons to decide if it's true or
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.720]   valid or important goes away as soon as a WikiLeaks starts performing editorial functions, like
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.680]   editing video and releasing it to news outlets, like saying, here's what we think is important,
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:58.840]   saying the government isn't telling you the whole truth, because as soon as they start
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:02.760]   performing that editorial function, everything else on their site becomes part of it.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.160]   And I think that's the danger.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.040]   If the WikiLeaks was just a repository and you could go to it and there was some information
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:12.080]   on there, you could take away and other people could form narratives from it, well, that would
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.080]   be different.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:16.000]   But they're very much performing editorial role as well.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.640]   Well, let's finish up with a story that is sort of the opposite.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.160]   It's someone who wanted to keep something secret in order to save society.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.000]   That is 45 year old Terry Childs, former sys admin for the city of San Francisco, who
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.280]   received his sentencing this weekend, actually on Friday, four years in prison for refusing
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:38.200]   to hand over administrative passwords to the city's fiber wind network back in July 2008.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.200]   Judge convicted Childs in April of violating state hacking laws.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:47.020]   Childs says that his bosses weren't competent and he would only give the passwords to the
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:52.260]   mayor after he had explained why his bosses were incompetent and couldn't be trusted with
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:53.740]   the system.
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:59.360]   But he has finally received his sentence and he'll spend four years in jail for defending
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.680]   his principles very assiduously.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:07.780]   This is a story that Molly and I were following back in Buzz out loud when we were on there
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:08.940]   together.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:14.720]   And it just there's something entertaining about a guy who, you know, whatever you think
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:18.120]   the facts of the case are said, you know, yeah, I'll go to jail.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.120]   Right.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:20.480]   I don't think my bosses know what they're doing.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.200]   I think they're endangering the city and I will only give this password to the mayor.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.720]   Talk about an unswerving belief in your own rightness.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.760]   This guy is like a poster boy for that particular behavior.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.600]   And I get not.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.360]   I mean, four years in jail.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360]   That's serious business.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.360]   It's ridiculous.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:40.840]   I think there's also a sort of sense of satisfaction for every single one of us who's been in that
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.320]   situation where you know that the guy who's managing stuff is incompetent and shouldn't
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.800]   be trusted with the information you have.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:52.720]   And you wanted to, you know, not get to him or not make him able to manage whatever he
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.120]   should be managing.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:57.480]   And he's actually going and doing it and going to jail for this.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.800]   I think he should we should open it fun for this guy and just, you know, make him rich
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.800]   after it comes out.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.920]   You haven't always felt like kind of a jerk.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:05.920]   Let's not go that far.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:06.920]   I mean, well, I'm not.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.720]   I mean, I'm not.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.320]   We should point out that during the 12 days that he would not return over the administrative
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.040]   passwords, the network ran fine.
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.960]   It never went down.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.120]   Nothing bad ever happened.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:26.480]   But the prosecutors characterized him as power hungry and sort of a control freak.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.480]   Yeah, you think you think you think I do?
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.800]   I think the four years is that's a pretty astonishingly harsh sentence.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.120]   I got to say, I think he really pissed him off.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.800]   Yeah, I have to imagine this trial was just amazing.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:41.120]   It was hilarious.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.640]   We could not get enough of this story on Buzz out loud.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.520]   I mean, we just I was we were like, I know it's local, but people.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.040]   This is amazing.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.160]   I demand to see the mayor.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.320]   He has to come to my jail cell like he's a little after give the password to anyone else.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.320]   And you know what?
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.280]   The mayor came to his jail cell because he had him buy the balls.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.320]   They couldn't do anything without him.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:05.120]   What if what if they're making an example of him right now?
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.400]   Yeah, what if the network was actually in danger because of these competent people?
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.280]   I mean, I'm sure it's the case, but you know, what if he was actually fighting for something
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.280]   right?
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.280]   Maybe?
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.240]   No, well, he's willing to risk it in case he is.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.120]   Yeah, because there's all I mean, how do you prove that in court?
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:24.480]   You know, I mean, that's that's a difficult one.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:28.560]   And he was probably saying I won't argue in court because you are competent.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:32.360]   Yeah, every villain is the hero of his own story.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.360]   Exactly.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.360]   And you are incompetent.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.360]   And you are incompetent.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360]   You are.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:44.640]   All right, well, you all, thank you very much for a very enjoyable discussion today on
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.640]   Twitter.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.640]   This is fantastic.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.560]   I know we have good news to work with, but you guys were great.
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.560]   Thank you so much.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:50.800]   Thanks for having me.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:51.800]   Us.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.800]   Thank you.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:53.800]   For my part, I am thrilled.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:57.520]   Eli Patel, managing editor of Engadget.
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.760]   You can follow you on Twitter.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.560]   Your Twitter name is reckless, correct?
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560]   It is.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.960]   Why is it reckless?
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:03.960]   I'm calming down now.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:09.360]   I think your next Twitter is going to be calming down.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.640]   I think anything else you want to plug?
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.200]   No, that's it.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.200]   Just sit in gadget.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.560]   I think we're going to have a big week this week.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.000]   So should we get a Patrick Bezia as host of Loanda Vutech.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.960]   You can find many of his works at French spin.com.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:30.360]   You can follow him on Twitter at not Patrick NOTPAT, R I C K anything else going on.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.160]   You want to tell us about?
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:36.720]   I guess if you like podcasts and you speak French or you're learning French, you could
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:43.120]   go to nowatch.fm where we have a number of excellent podcasts to entertain you.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.120]   Excellent.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.120]   Or excellent.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.120]   It's well.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.120]   Maybe.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:54.280]   Ah, Molly Wood at cnet.com/mollyexecutiveeditor of cnet.com, host of Buzz Out Loud and the Buzz
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.440]   Report.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.440]   Thank you very much.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.440]   This has been fantastic.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440]   It's been really fun.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.440]   It's good to be back in the saddle with you again.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.440]   I know I missed you.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.440]   I want to be on Buzz Out Loud again.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.040]   And I want you on Tech News today.
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.040]   All right.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.000]   We were thinking of planning a big crossover event.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.760]   Allah, NCIS and NCIS Los Angeles.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.760]   Or like when Allison Skagliadio was on Eureka.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.880]   Yeah, that time when that happened.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.680]   Oh, in the love boat, Dr. Fantasy Island.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.440]   But yeah, we got it.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.760]   We got it one day where Tom is on Buzz Out Loud and then I'm on TNT and we just have
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.080]   a big, a big blowout crossover event.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.080]   It's going to be great.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:30.960]   But to realize in these crossover events, you have to have sort of a continued narrative.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.840]   So you have to build a story.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:33.840]   True.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:35.840]   Okay.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.840]   Well, we'll get to work on that.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.840]   And then maybe I'll.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:38.840]   Thanks Friday.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:39.840]   We'll figure it out.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:40.840]   Lea Lea Porte.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.960]   We'll be back in the saddle or rather on the ball.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.960]   Once again, next week, thanks to him for letting me fill in.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.320]   This was really fun.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:53.240]   And you can find us at twit.tv and watch us live every Sunday at 3 p.m. Pacific 6 p.m.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.960]   Eastern Vive. twit.tv.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.520]   That does it for us.
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.080]   And that can is another twit.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.080]   That's it.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.080]   That's it.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.080]   We did it.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.080]   That was an interesting twist.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:09.080]   That can is an up twit.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.080]   That was in that can.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.080]   That was a good show.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.080]   I knew the cigarette.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.080]   That was meaty.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.080]   We got deep.
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.080]   That was real.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:25.080]   Let's go round.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:32.080]   Round the morning.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:36.660]   [buzzing]
