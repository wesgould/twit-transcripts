[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   blah, blah, blah, guns, guts, glory.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And like, look, man, there's a reason they put the Second Amendment
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   next to the first amendment.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   It's because the American government can't be trusted.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I mean, we were founded -- I mean, look at the revolution, man.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   What a politically complicated thing to look at.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I mean, it's basically a bunch of entitled, older gentlemen
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   that were pissed off about paying taxes for the services
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   they've received from their government.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Sounds like devorect.org/blog.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   >> So, well, the other thing is, you know, this is also not a small --
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   you know, a small island where people are crammed in.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   We have a lot of wide open spaces where you're probably
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   better off carrying some heat.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   >> You never know when a Wolverine's going to try to rip your face off.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> Well, or some sort of a weirdo.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> Hey, did anybody go to the --
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   >> Yeah, we may introduce me before we go on.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> Don C. Devorect, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   >> Needs no introduction.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   >> The panda needs no introduction, but wants one anyway.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> That's right.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   >> Did anybody go to the Bigfoot press conference down in Palo Alto last Friday?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   There's a guy who caught a Bigfoot.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   >> Allegedly.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   >> Turns out it's a possum and a gorilla suit, which is kind of an odd combination.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> Oh.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   >> They wouldn't even bring it wisdom.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   >> Possum and a gorilla suit?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   >> They said, yeah, they said the DNA to an -- I don't know, some guy.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Some guy.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   He said a meal e-mail back and said, "This is possum, d-m-a."
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And they said, "We'll see that proves it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It must be Bigfoot."
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   >> They said they thought the Bigfoot maybe ate a possum.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   >> That was their way around it.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   >> I ate a possum.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   >> The funny thing is this guy wasn't even like a real expert.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   This guy was just some guy they found in the e-mail.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And he still didn't cooperate.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   >> No, you're supposed to say it's Bigfoot.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   >> It's a possum.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   >> It's a sexting catch.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   >> It's supposed to say it's Bigfoot.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> So do we have any tech news this week?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I like that story.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I thought that was a good story.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   There's lots of -- are you kidding?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Will Harris has been going wild with the tech news.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   New BlackBerry coming out?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   900?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   The bold?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Are you excited?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   >> Next.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   >> I like how John likes the kids.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I like how John likes to keep us moving along.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   >> Like this one.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Here's a story.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Gase says apple played chicken with mobile meat launch.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I haven't seen this story before.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Tell us about it.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   >> They didn't play chicken.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   They ran it right off the cliff.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   >> John was a former apple president who was forced out some years ago.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Remember he wrote B or subsidized B-O-S.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   He was a scullie.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   >> But he's not bitter.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   >> He's not bitter.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   He says a long blog post in which he says the machismo that leads to playing chicken with
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   launches is what screwed up the mobile meat launch.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   He said no one -- oh, I says it in French, by the way.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   No one had enough brains and guts to risk humiliation and raise a hand and say, chief.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Everybody calls Steve Jobs.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Chief.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We are not ready here.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Let's stop everything.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   As a result, the mobile meat badly crashed on launch.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That doesn't -- I mean, that kind of stuff.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   >> I love it.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   >> It's like -- it's you.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> So, but I guess what he's saying is that -- but you know, he understands the apple culture.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   He's saying that people were, you know, as always with every Silicon Valley launch, going
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   right up to the wire and you go up to the wire, you got the launch and somebody should have
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   stepped forward and say it's not ready.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   But you know, with the Steve Jobs running the show, you're not --
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   >> Steve, do you want to say no to Steve Jobs?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Do you want to be the guy that steps in the street and says, Steve, you know how we are
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   planning on doing this thing?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   >> I believe my options invested.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   >> Yeah, right.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   >> It's pretty, I mean, that's -- and, you know, this is the problem with a little bit
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   of corporate culture at Apple is that you can't say no to anybody.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   But don't you think Steve fired people anywhere?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I know he did.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   The guy who ran Mobile Me was ousted.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   >> He was?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   >> I think, you know, he was moved upstairs or something.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   They brought in a new guy to run Mobile Me.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   >> Reshuffled.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   >> Reshuffled.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   >> I think that worked into oblivion.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I mean, I think it's fairly self-evident to say they played Chicken with Launch.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   They tried to get it done for the launch like you would do with any product.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   They failed and decided to punt it out anyway.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I hope it would work.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   >> It works now, though.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   >> But it's -- well, it's -- I don't know if, you know, they decided they didn't -- they
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   didn't have a public beta.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   They didn't have an open beta.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   They didn't do a lot of what most companies would consider due diligence with, you know,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   straining the servers pre-launch, you know.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And are you sure it's fixed?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I thought they promised to have it fixed sometime between now and Christmas.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   >> Well, the mail -- that was the email I read.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   >> It's a quite year.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   >> It's kind -- I mean, it's working for me.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   >> Works for me.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   >> It's a cloud.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   >> It's a cloud.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   The cloud is -- we don't know if the cloud works or not.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   >> Cloud is a bad idea.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   >> So, me.com -- how many people want a me.com email address?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   >> Chirp, chirp.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   >> Is that a -- you know.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Apparently, according to a story in the IDG News Service in computer world, if you happen
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   to be, for instance, I am the greatest at Gmail.com, according to the University of Leipzig,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   some professor said, you know, people assume you are a narcissist.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   He says, people really judge you based on the email address you choose.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So, if you're at AOL.com, they go newbie.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   >> Or old dud.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   >> Old dud newbie.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   >> What does it say about if you have an entire domain name named after yourself?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   >> Narcissist.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   >> What do you got in early?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   >> Willherris.com, do you have that?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   >> I have that, couldn't you, Kay?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   >> Actually, he has Willherris' so damn hot.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   He's too goddamn hot for Britain.com.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   >> In a paper in the Journal of Research and Personality, the scientist took a look at
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   under 600 email addresses just under and had people who created them fill out a brief personality
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.680]   questionnaire then they asked 100 students to rate the same addresses to find out if the
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:18.400]   email name seemed to be neurotic, open, agreeable, conscientious, narcissistic or extroverted.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.000]   If somebody were, say, Leo@leoville.com.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.520]   >> Wait, so they had student, they didn't have the test group to it, they didn't have a
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.000]   large group to it, they didn't have a diverse group to it, students decided whether or not,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   you know.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   >> Well, what they were trying to see is if--
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   >> We picked 100 very, very mature college students to make decisions about--
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   >> Well, no, but students are like normal people, I mean the sense that--
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   >> No.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   >> No, not true.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   >> Does it have a student in your house, John?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   >> Yeah, and I do.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   They tend to judge people based on their addresses, for example, people who used words like little,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   sweet or baby combined with cute animal names like mousy or bunny, littlebabybunny@aol.com.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   What would you say, what would you say, neurotic, open, agreeable, conscientious, narcissistic
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   or extroverted?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Pick one.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   >> Exploitable.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   >> How about idiots?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   >> It's not on the list.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   They say agreeable and neurotic.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   On the other hand, words like king or the best were linked to narcissism, even more interesting.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   These judgments tended to be right in five of the six personality characters they measured.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   In other words, they gave these people then MMPIs or some sort of inventory and they said,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   yeah, they are narcissists.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Openness is the easiest thing to gauge.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Students would miss the mark on extroversion.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   >> Man.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   >> So your next boss is not a good name.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   >> No.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   >> And I think me.com--
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   >> That's fine, that's some of the redstones name, it's weird.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   >> Really, is that his email address?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   >> No.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   >> Your next boss at me.com?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   >> That would be pretty good.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   >> And the boss.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   >> I often wonder though, you see AOL for instance, can you be a business-like person if your
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   email address is at AOL.com?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   >> I've seen actually a lot of eBay-type shops and non-particularly tech-centric places that
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   still use AOL addresses.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And they always kind of-- so it is, you look at it and you're like, huh?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And you're like, oh, well this is a guy who builds machine parts.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   He doesn't really care about having a serious address.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   >> John McCain at webtv.com, what does that tell you?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   >> Tells you a much email.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   >> Somebody's fake, that's a fake.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   >> Talking about--
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   >> I love the fact that you actually entertained that as being possible, John.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   >> Well, you know, I don't think I'm unreasonable in that regard.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   >> He says he's not-- he doesn't use a computer, he has people to do that for him.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   >> He can't even bought-- you know, how many people actually bought web TV the second time
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   around?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   >> Yeah, no kidding.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   >> I think it's kind of scary that--
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   >> Yeah, I'm not going to get into politics again.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   >> Oh, yeah, let's hear from the great Brits about our politics.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   >> Well--
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   >> Yeah, I just ran into something on the web that was showing posters and bumper stickers
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   in England that's saying UK for Obama with that "Bama logo" and the whole thing.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I think, what is wrong with these people?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   >> The board.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   >> Just on the subject of Apple and Jobs, did you see that Apple is now worth more than
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Google?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   >> Wow!
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   >> In terms of net worth, 159 billion, market cap, 157 billion market cap.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   >> It's all paper though, it's not.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   >> Yeah, who cares?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   >> Well, I can guys in funny coats in Wall Street are going over the price of a stock.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's mythical, it's fake until you cash out.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   >> You know, it's not real much.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.400]   >> So it doesn't signify in some ways that the market thinks that Apple has better chances
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.000]   than Google maybe?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   >> Something like that.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   >> It's not real.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   >> It works.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   >> It's not how it works.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   >> It's not chopped liver, give me a break.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   >> Wait, what's the market, what's the, what's the, what's Halliburton's value?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That would be really funny.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   >> Take a look at GM, it's about one tenth of either of those guys.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   >> Is that really?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   >> No.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   >> Is it Facebook with more on paper than like Ford?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   >> Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's true.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   >> I think you're going to do a leverage buyout by those guys.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   >> What do they call that?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Capitalization?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   What do they call that?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   What's that term?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   >> Market cap.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   >> Market cap?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   >> It's refers to the amount of the...
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   >> It's refers to the amount of the stock is worth on the open market at the closing price.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   >> Based on the number of shares available times the price.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   >> Hold on one second.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   >> Halliburton's like 38 billion.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   >> Wow.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   >> Cheaper than Yahoo.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   >> Yeah, so Google's market capitalization is like four point something times Halliburton's.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.560]   >> You know, I would say yeah, who cares, but we pay so much attention to stock price,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:47.200]   which really isn't market cap more significant than stock price because stock price doesn't
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.080]   say how many shares are outstanding.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.560]   So at least this combines the number of shares outstanding.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.360]   >> Well, it's 876 million shares of Halliburton and there's 314 million shares of Google.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.960]   >> Shouldn't you be talking about this with Horowitz last week?
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.280]   >> Yeah, you didn't like that show so much, did you?
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.440]   >> No, I didn't mind the show.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.560]   I just didn't like the fact that that twerp Jason Calicanos had to jump all over Eric's
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   finder and not knowing anything about it.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.560]   >> By the way, I think Craig's finder is kind of back up with some sort of odd proxy setup
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   or something that Eric gave back up.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   >> Yeah, back up and then they took some of the stuff down so what Eric has decided to
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.560]   do is, and by the way, he did ask for permission to use the thing, which is what annoyed me
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.560]   about Calicanos because he didn't, you know, he was speculating.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   >> Well, he was speculating.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.560]   >> Yeah, well, that's all he does.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.560]   So anyway, he's just basically going to release the code to the public domain.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   Anybody wants to run this thing and run it up there?
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   There you go.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   Let a million flowers bloom and let Craig play whack-a-mole with that.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.160]   I think Jason, remember Jason's friends with Craig Newmark and maybe felt a little defensive,
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:57.160]   but I think Jason, like the rest of the panel last week, said that, you know, ultimately
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.640]   the reasons Craig and Jim gave for shutting it down were bogus.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   He said that.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   >> Yeah, they're totally bogus.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.120]   >> They said it was a protect our community, but that's bogus.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.080]   >> There's other systems that are running under it.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   And I got a bunch of Twitters that said, "Hey, what about this one?"
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.440]   And that one is about three or four of these kinds of devices.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.040]   And then meanwhile, why is Craig going around telling everybody to use Google?
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.120]   I thought he was like a community-oriented guy.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120]   >> That's an interesting response.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120]   Yeah, that doesn't make sense.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.880]   >> Well, he's trying to create a bunch of local communities.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.760]   And it's just, you know, it's supposed to be one global Craigslist community, each community
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   is local.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.960]   Maybe that's what he considers the dividing line between Craigslist and eBay.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.560]   >> But that doesn't explain the Google thing because if you go to and look up something
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:47.440]   on Google and you use site, colon, you know, Craigslist.org, it looks at all of them all
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   over the world.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   >> Right.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.800]   I think that's what he does in the view of, you know, throwing out chilling effects,
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.040]   cease and desist orders.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   >> Use Google instead.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.520]   >> By looting his, yeah.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.400]   >> Don't do something with Craig in the name because eventually I'll have to sue you.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.200]   >> Hey, were you guys watching the Olympics on TV or were you watching them on the net?
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.720]   >> There's a bunch of savvy internet types.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.760]   >> I've been amazed people whining about the television coverage and being completely ignorant.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.520]   You can watch, like, for all of the sports that you, you know, except in the 70s on wide
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.440]   world of sports where you'd see, like, you know, Olympic class, you know, marbles or
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   something.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.160]   Like, you remember wide world of sports when it was just, you know, it'd be like, you
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.720]   know, all these serious sports and then something completely bizarre.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   >> ESPN eight.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.160]   >> I mean, I was watching, like, online, like, you can watch, you know, three of the
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.600]   half hours of, you know, wrestling eliminations by class.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   >> And you have every week.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.280]   >> And I like it because there's not much commentary.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.280]   It's just the event.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.880]   I kind of enjoyed it online.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.880]   22 hours are putting up online.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.880]   But they were very concerned about a cannibalizing.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.960]   >> Yeah, the trouble was, though, they were concerned about cannibalizing their TV coverage.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.560]   But then we're putting out Twitter messages spoiling the results.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.560]   >> So if you were following your--
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   >> You might have watched live.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.760]   >> If you're following them on Twitter, they were telling people the results before it
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.960]   was broadcast and it's like, well, that's been annoying, isn't it?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.320]   >> So they've already had more viewers than the last Olympics.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.920]   They've got more of the 18 to 34 demo watching.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.480]   The coveted-- sorry, it's the coveted 18 to 34 demo.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.160]   And everything says, you know, they sold a ton of advertising.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.840]   They've sold millions of dollars of advertising since the start of the Olympics.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.760]   I mean, they're-- you know, it sounds like they're rolling in money and their numbers
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.760]   are really good.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.560]   >> Well, that's what NBC learned.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.560]   They were very concerned.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.760]   In fact, you remember they didn't put the opening event online until after they broadcast
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.920]   it on TV because they were afraid people would watch it online and then not watch TV.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.560]   The research is out for the first week and Alan Wertzel, NBC's president of research,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.160]   says, quote, "The internet hardly cannibalizes.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.640]   It actually fuels interest."
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.960]   Half of the online users want to catch up with events they may have missed.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.560]   Another 40% want to replay something they first saw on TV.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.720]   81 million people watched the men's swimming relay on television.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   Another 1.7 watched it later.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.480]   Again, on the web.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.760]   The web is actually driving TV viewership and vice versa.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.760]   >> Yes.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.760]   We've always known happens.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.160]   That's one of the effects of the web people.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.200]   We've been hounding people about this.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.680]   And let me make a comment about it.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.840]   I mean, I've been watching on both.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.600]   I tend to watch-- there's a lot of obscure events I might want to check out and look
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   at them online.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.600]   >> The wrestling, the judo, the Kai.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.520]   I mean, they've done this amazing-- they've shot this beautiful video of, like,
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.280]   the K1 and the canoeing competitions, the whitewater.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.560]   And it's incredible to see all of the eliminations on that.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.080]   >> 90% of people who follow the Olympics watch it only on TV, the other 10% used every
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.120]   medium they could find.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.600]   The internet, mobile phones, video on demand from cable.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.960]   Only 2/10 of 1% used the internet exclusively.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.120]   >> Well, the one thing I wanted to mention is that I think the Olympics are successful
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.360]   this year because there's a shortage of very-- there's hardly any of these
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.600]   sappy, crummy features they did the last couple of years.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   >> Up close and personal.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.920]   >> Up close and personal garbage that nobody cares about.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.840]   About someone had a club foot when they were 14 and now they--
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.400]   >> They've been getting some of that in.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.040]   They've just been very, very brief about it.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.040]   But not-- yeah, I agree.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.840]   It hasn't been an overwhelming, like, you know, people need drama to care about the
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   Olympics.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.000]   >> Yeah, I think that was always conventional wisdom is that people won't care about these
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.560]   silly sports like field hockey unless there are star-- you know, unless they know that
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   people are playing.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   >> Don't call field hockey.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.560]   >> Don't call field hockey.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.360]   >> Sarah-- Sarah with my butt, I know.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   >> Whatever.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.440]   >> I think the point is that they don't understand that the games themselves are dramatic and
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.720]   the only thing is the only people that would feel that way are people that don't like sports,
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.080]   which is what I think were the people that came up with these idiotic ideas to do all
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   these stupid, sappy features.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   >> I agree.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   >> I think the best is on--
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.960]   >> I like putting celebrities, mainstream celebrities on a tech show because non-tech
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   technical people will care, John.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.840]   >> Mm, never heard of such a thing.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   That's a crazy idea.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.880]   Nobody be that foolish.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.960]   Not insane.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.000]   So in Britain, you've been watching the Olympics in Britain, Will Harris.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   >> Yeah, it's--
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.480]   >> Is it very different, the coverage on the BBC?
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.040]   >> Well, it's much straighter and less glitzy.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.480]   It's BBC, so it's quite down the line.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.120]   But they've actually been broadcasting on the web simultaneously.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.000]   So like the opening ceremony, for example, you could watch live on the BBC's website via
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.360]   Flash as it was on the TV.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.440]   By far, the best thing I've been watching is definitely the beach volleyball.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.240]   >> Well, everybody loves that.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240]   >> Oh.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.560]   >> Yeah, that's worth the price of admission.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.360]   >> When I was up in Canada, I was watching it off the CBC.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   >> How were they doing?
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.760]   >> I'm sorry, I'm-- I was up in Washington.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.360]   I was up in-- which we watched the CBC up there.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.360]   >> Right.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.360]   What was that coverage like?
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.040]   >> It was, I think, probably like the BBC's a little bit.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.640]   It was a little-- it was different people.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.200]   They were less amenable to the china-- I mean, they weren't kissing the Chinese butts as much
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   as the Americans did.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.640]   >> That's been interesting, too, hasn't it?
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.720]   They have not word one about the Chinese hosts.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   I mean, it's like--
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   >> So this-- right.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   So the-- so the--
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.400]   >> Bob Costa called-- actually kind of called out President Bush on it when he interviewed
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.280]   President Bush.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.160]   Before later on that day, President Bush was caught with the infamous and I'm sure Will
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.320]   has been following this, the misty-made trainer.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.800]   >> He slapped you.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   >> Would you like to, sir?
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   >> Is that where he slapped--
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   >> But slapping.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.040]   >> But he didn't slap her on the butt.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.520]   He had a good sense to slap her higher.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.520]   I think it was close.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.520]   >> No, I watched it in slow motion.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520]   >> He's trying to hit the target.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.080]   >> No, no, no.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.920]   You know, I-- look, I'm not a Bush defender on this one, on most things, but on this one
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.120]   I'm going to stand up and say, "No win situation."
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.960]   First of all, he probably shouldn't have been there.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.640]   But he was there, and she turns around and says, "Slap my butt."
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.800]   What are you going to do?
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.120]   You look like a dork no matter what you do, right?
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.520]   So he did the only thing he could do, which I thought was quite sensible.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.200]   He kind of-- he taps her on her back, on her lower back.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.520]   It was high up above the butt.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.360]   >> Well, it's also weird when it's like--
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.760]   >> That was a tough thing for him.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.080]   >> You're watching the Olympics.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.000]   He's hanging out with Vladimir Putin.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   >> Watching-- putting ceremony.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.040]   Apparently, you know, we find out later on when Costas asked him, talking about the
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.920]   whole Georgia incident.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.360]   You know, the next day he's basically hanging out with the athletes, which on one hand
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.640]   has to be incredible for your president to come out to support you.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.040]   And on the other hand, you've got to be sitting there like, "Can't you do something about
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   the economy, sir?"
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.080]   >> I just wonder, it's kind of odd that he wasn't in a luxury box.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.640]   It looks like he was just sitting in the stands with everybody else.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   And he didn't-- he looked kind of bored.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.760]   I caught him looking at his watch a couple of times.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.760]   That was odd.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.760]   >> It was quite interesting.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.160]   The coverage in the UK was much more cynical about the Chinese.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.520]   There was segment after segment where, you know, there were a couple of British reporters
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.960]   that had been arrested for the reporting on various different things.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.080]   There's a lot of coverage of the Chinese police arresting these reporters.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   Like a lot of coverage.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.840]   >> Thank goodness for Twitter.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.640]   There was a really interesting Twitter exchange.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.440]   She was in Chinese, but you could probably-- I saw a translation of it.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.040]   A Chinese blogger who went to Beijing to cover the Olympics, not necessarily a political
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.840]   blogger, Twittering as he gets arrested by the secret police.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.160]   Well, it's funny because this guy's 27 and childless, but it was the one child police
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   who came and got him.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.520]   He said, "Oh, I mean, I don't have any children there, so you have more than one child--
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.800]   I don't have any children."
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.760]   And get him to go back to the country where he belongs and get out of town.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:21.440]   But because of Twitter, he has Blackberry and Twitter-bearing, the whole thing.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.000]   You know, I think that's quite interesting.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   >> It's technology, isn't it?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.320]   >> The future of the sort of change of the internet.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:33.280]   >> We met-- I met somebody at New Media Expo that's doing a really interesting site, allvoices.com.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.840]   Just went online.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:42.280]   And they're using a kind of Google News style aggregation to get citizen journalists, text
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:50.440]   messages, tweets, MMSs, photos, blogs, and then they're going to use software to pinpoint
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.440]   it on the map.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.840]   And so if there's something going on, let's say Russia invading Georgia, they'll be able
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.040]   to get on the ground from citizens these posts.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.640]   I think it's really interesting.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.680]   Allvoices.com.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.640]   And even though it's brand new, there's some real coverage here, even of China.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.600]   >> So you were at enemy this week.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.280]   So it's like a silver light application.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.760]   >> I don't know.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760]   Is it?
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760]   If it is, maybe it's Flash.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.960]   What do you-- I mean, silver light worked pretty well for Microsoft's for NBC, didn't
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.960]   it?
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.960]   >> I thought they did a pretty good job.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.840]   So yes, so you can hover your mouse over the map and see where there are events going
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   on.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.440]   And I like this idea, ultimately, of citizen journalism, right?
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.000]   >> You know, I saw the same exact app on the Silverlight developer site.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.560]   I was looking at some of the things we were working on.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.120]   The exact same thing some guys developed.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.000]   It's part of a-- oh, wait a minute.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.160]   No, I take it back.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   Sorry.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.520]   I saw this exact same app exactly on pipes.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   >> Oh, maybe.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   Yahoo pipes?
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520]   >> Huh.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.720]   >> And there's a guy who developed this thing with the same little markers that were some
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   news is taking place.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.680]   >> Well, maybe they're using this technology because I talked to the founder and she said
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.320]   it's all computer generated.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   So then I imagine--
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.840]   >> You know, this guy had this really cool pipe.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.760]   It was like it went from the news feeds from Reuters and some other places then it went
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.200]   to the-- then it found out where they were coming, where the sites were that were producing
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.360]   the news and then it went to a map and then it went to this and that and then it ended
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.480]   up with this-- it looks exactly the same.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.040]   >> Here's George's president eating his tie on TV.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.840]   >> Yeah, it's a classic.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.360]   >> Yeah, I have to say, I love the concept of a sort of open media site from all around
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360]   the world.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360]   >> Well, they're very hard.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.120]   >> But the sort of proof of putting is in the eating and the stuff that's in front page
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.120]   is just like--
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   >> Well, it's brand new.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   It launched two weeks ago.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.200]   I think that the key is getting-- in fact, one of the reasons I want to plug it is to
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.520]   get people to start using it sign up for it, especially if you're in a war-torn region
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   of the world.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.600]   >> Yeah, if you're in the war zone region of the world, the first thing you're thinking
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600]   about is Twitter now.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.600]   >> Sign up for that in a minute.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.600]   Yeah, Twitter now.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.600]   Twitter now, we want to get the reports direct.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.800]   >> So I'm not-- I'm not-- I don't know.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.040]   This doesn't look-- I'm not impressed.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040]   >> Not impressing you.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.800]   >> So is there anything exciting that came out of NMA that you enjoyed in particular or--
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.880]   >> Well, our coverage is pretty exciting.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.800]   We spent-- remember Patrick, a million dollars going down to CES at Comdex before that to cover
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.680]   it for tech TV.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.480]   And basically did the same thing for 50 bucks in a box of Cheetos.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   I mean, it was--
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.320]   >> Yeah, but I mean, but covering like NME, you know, that's like covering the Schwan
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.160]   chicken racing tournament versus covering the Super Bowl.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.640]   >> Well, what did we do so different--
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.640]   >> The little more--
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.240]   >> Yeah, but I don't know if we did so different really.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.040]   I mean, we just-- we sat up there on a stage with people same place.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.880]   >> Well, I've been seeing-- yes, there's 12,000 products, 25--
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.360]   >> We covered 12,000 products.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.560]   We sat on a stage and people came to us.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.560]   >> Absolutely.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.360]   >> Well, yeah, you showed up and people came to you.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.840]   I spent nine hours a day meeting with vendors and getting the products in for you.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.640]   >> Oh, you're bitter.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.680]   >> No, I'm not bitter at all.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.760]   I'm just reminding Leo that there were a couple of--
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.760]   >> They were producers.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.760]   >> They were producers.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.760]   Well, I'd be curious.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.960]   You know, I wanted to do this as a test, you know, proof of concept.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:06.520]   >> Yeah, but I mean, Leo, we've covered CES twice once doing live shows and once doing
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.800]   tape stuff with DLTV.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.280]   And we did tape show, you know, I mean, we did live stuff using a tricaster with DLTV.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.920]   And the biggest problem, actually, in most cases is getting bandwidth during CES to upload
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.920]   to your show.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   >> Yes, absolutely.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.320]   >> So, yeah, I mean, we did it for, you know, a tiny fraction of what tech TV would
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.960]   have cost, but we also did a, you know, much more modest show.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.920]   We did it, you know, a couple hours a day for four days.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   You know, we did it with our three--
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   >> I think this is pretty exciting.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.280]   Yeah, I think it's pretty exciting with you.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.160]   We'll try CES in January.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.680]   I'm torn between CES and Mackerel, because Mackerel's so close.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   >> Figure out your bandwidth.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.160]   The bandwidth issues at CES are dramatic.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   >> Right.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.000]   >> We had it-- yeah, and this worked really well.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   We were in the LVC, but we had a dedicated DSL line that nobody else was using.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.280]   And that worked pretty well.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.840]   >> The thing is, though, usually in the LVC, what they call a dedicated line is actually
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.840]   a split line.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   And--
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.920]   >> No, no, no, we had a DSL modem on it.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.920]   >> Okay.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.040]   >> Well, if you had a DSL modem, that might have been.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.040]   It's weird.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.520]   I've run into stuff where they claim it's--
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.520]   >> No, I understand.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.640]   They sell it to you as if it's dedicated, but it's, you know, 15 other people are also
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.880]   buying the dedicated line.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.720]   >> Yeah, because they basically, they only have a single vendor in there doing all of
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   the accents.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   >> Right.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.720]   So I have to find out how they did it.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   Stick-empted it for us.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.520]   I have to find out how they did it, because that's exactly the model for next time.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.560]   John, on your blog, you have the blue screen of death on the opening ceremonies.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.040]   Is this real or is that a reflection?
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.840]   >> Yeah, that was confirmed by Gizmodo and a bunch of independent people who--
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.040]   I guess the stands were filled with enough people that saw that thing that they all took
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   pictures of it.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.960]   So there's about 10 or 15 pictures of it from different people all over the place.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.040]   Initially, when it came in, we thought it was like an obvious Photoshop job.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.040]   >> Right.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.040]   >> No.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   No, it's the real deal.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.320]   It was a blue screen of death at the Olympics during this thing, and the big giant thing on
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   the side of the building.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.340]   >> Well, yeah, because that's the screen that they had in the rim and around the bird's
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.400]   nest where they were projecting the water and so forth.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.600]   Obviously, they were using PowerPoint projectors and a PC to project it.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.320]   Whoops, a little BSOD there.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.800]   >> My understanding is Gates was in the audience when that happened.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   >> You're kidding.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.800]   No, really?
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   >> That's what I heard.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   I don't know.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   That sounds a little too perfect, isn't it?
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   >> It does.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   >> Oh, God.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   >> Can you imagine being build gates and looking at--
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   >> That would make you think somebody may have like crashed it on purpose.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   >> It'd be so humiliating.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   >> I've never seen--
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   >> Yeah, I don't--
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   >> You know, it's--
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   >> Yeah, it's for like four years in a row.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.740]   >> That's true, but you know, that blue screen of death is like, that looks like a Windows
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.300]   98 blue screen to me.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.300]   I don't even see that much anymore.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.220]   >> Is that like paid for the license anyway?
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.020]   >> Ha, yeah, that's true.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.820]   It's probably a blue-lay copy.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.660]   >> If you were watching our broadcast-- our Twitter cast last week, actually, with the
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.380]   Twitch show, I had a blue screen of death right at the beginning of the recording on
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.660]   this Vista machine to my left.
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.660]   >> Died.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.660]   >> Died.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.580]   >> And it stayed blue the whole show because I didn't-- I was in the show.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.580]   I couldn't turn it off.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.840]   Fortunately, we had a backup recording, but-- so no, they still happen.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   They still happen.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.180]   It does look like-- it doesn't, you know, let me zoom in on it.
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:05.700]   It doesn't look like-- I don't know if I can quite read it.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.740]   It's not in Chinese, I don't think.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:13.380]   >> Hey, John, did you see the report that GE made $1.7 billion off of all the work they
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.160]   did for the Olympics for China?
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160]   >> Whoo!
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.720]   Because they're one of the main sponsors of the online stuff.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   >> So what did they do?
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.720]   Did they set up a lot?
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   I mean, because I've certainly--
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.560]   >> Everything from networks to--
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   >> Interesting.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.040]   >> Power, supply, infrastructure, everything from like, yeah, pretty much everything.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.880]   >> Because a lot of what-- certainly my interpretation of what I saw at the opening ceremonies was
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.840]   China saying not only do we have a lot of people who can work in perfect synchrony, but
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.400]   we also have great technology.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.000]   So it was American technology.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   >> Well, that's--
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.600]   >> Interesting, I know how much they spent in total on all of the Olympics.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   >> Oh, man.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   Well, you don't have to tell them.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.760]   >> Yeah, you know, I am actually a buyer.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.120]   The job they did, I think overall, even though there was, you know, there's a-- we have
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.760]   a couple of reports, you know, they have a protest area that they're-- if you go in,
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.600]   you want to protest, they arrest you.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.400]   They say, oh, yeah, no, we're going to have a special protest area, you know?
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.400]   >> Oh, they are.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.400]   >> You're going to get one of protests, you're under arrest.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   >> Yeah, out of here.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.800]   >> I mean, that kind of thing, yeah, but at the same time--
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.960]   >> It's not what they've been doing with the-- with the couple of the conferences.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.320]   >> Yeah, and the conferences that have been going on, the economic conferences in the
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.560]   United States, oh, wait, there's no area to collect you, they just arrest you in the streets
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.560]   now, right?
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.560]   >> Yeah, that works.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.760]   But anyway, but I think overall it's been an outstanding product over, you know, and
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.560]   I want to call it a product because that's what it is.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560]   >> It is a product, yeah.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.760]   >> And it's an outstanding one.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.400]   I think I really got-- you know, and the fact that they can get all these people together
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.280]   is like a giant party with all the best people, and that American basketball team is just
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.800]   the fun-- it's more fun than anything to watch.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   They're just terrific.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.480]   They look like they're having fun.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.200]   And you know, it's just astonishing.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.400]   >> I had to say, this has been an enjoyable Olympics.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.640]   Very commercial though, if you watch it on TV, I mean, every five minutes they're breaking
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   away.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.640]   >> Yeah, you got to stop it.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.400]   >> It's interesting because it's really the only major TV event that you can count on
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.560]   these days as TV audiences get so fractured.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.280]   It's very rare that a large chunk of the populace comes together for anything.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.680]   >> I got to-- you know what, they're still getting like 10 or 15 million people showing
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.080]   up for the Dancing With Weasels, you know, the America's Next Great.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.880]   So you're Weasel can dance?
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.880]   I think that's it.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.880]   >> Well, you know what I mean?
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.720]   Some of those shows will here are gathering in, you know, America and Weasel.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.760]   You know, so they-- if they have 30 million people watching Olympics, that's one in every
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.680]   10 Americans, and it's not unusual for a lot of those bizarre shows to get like, you
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.680]   know, seven--
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.040]   >> Do you think American Idol got better ratings in the Olympics?
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.040]   >> I think so.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   >> At times it has, yeah.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.800]   >> But you know, also the Olympics are segmented.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   There's not just one challenge.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   >> Sure.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:43.880]   >> The
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:33:08.960]   >> The
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:26.280]   >> The
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:40.760]   >> The
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:55.240]   >> The
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:09.720]   >> The
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:24.200]   >> The
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:38.680]   >> The
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:53.160]   >> The
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:35:07.640]   >> The
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:22.120]   >> The
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:36.600]   >> The
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:51.080]   >> The
