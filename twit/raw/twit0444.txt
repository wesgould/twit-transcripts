[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.900]   I think not.

[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   And we got a great panel joining us from IDG, editorial director, Jason Snell, Editor-in-Chief at Macworld Magazine.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   Good to see you, Jason.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   Great to be back.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   It's a rainy around here. You've forted the rivers.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.700]   We Californians do not take to rain or other things coming from the sky.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   It's confusing.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.700]   So it's so good.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.700]   People don't know how to drive in it and all that.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.200]   But it's nice. We haven't had any rain in like a year.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   So it's good to get some.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   We've been drying out.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   Also joining us, Mr. Brian Brushwood from Austin, Texas, host of NSFW,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   Scam School and Hacking the System.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.700]   Yeah, man. I'm on TV. Look, Mom, I made it.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.700]   Congratulations, new National Geographic Show, which it turns out Brian's been filming for the last few years.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   We've been filming for the last four years without telling us.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   Now, when did you start filming it?
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.700]   We started shooting over the summer.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.700]   But of course, television, everything moved so slow.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.700]   So it's like we had the idea over a year ago, started pitching it.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.700]   And man, the hardest thing about everything is keeping your stupid mouth shut about everything.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700]   I couldn't do it.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   It's something, you know, I'm so excited about it.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.700]   And so it was great to be able to finally announce it on NSFW this last week.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   Yay. It's on National Geographic. It was on last Thursday.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   What day is it?
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.700]   It's the two episodes. It'll be an hour long special February 27th on Nat Geo.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.700]   Check your local list.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.700]   I thought they said this Thursday.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.700]   No, it will be a Thursday.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700]   Two weeks from now.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   Okay. It's called Hacking the System.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.700]   And it's only two episodes?
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   Yeah. Well, they're running it as a special.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.700]   So it's like, you know, I'm just glad that the thing's actually on TV.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.700]   I mean, you know how this business goes.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.700]   You have so many projects that fizzle and don't become what you want.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.700]   Like this is, this is a show I love.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.700]   I'm happy with how it turned out.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.700]   It was a lot of fun to shoot.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.700]   We got to blow up cars and shoot machine guns and break into houses and stuff.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   That's exciting.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   Well, good. Can't wait.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.700]   Thank you. Thank you for being here, Brian.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.700]   And we've got a new beyond here.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.700]   I want to welcome Jessica Lesson.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.700]   We talked to Jess actually.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   Jessica was on the phone with us before.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.700]   That for a while.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   Yeah, you were in that.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   It's better to be real.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   But I'm so glad you're here in the studio with us.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.700]   Jessica is editor in chief of the information, which is a very new tech news site.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   You created behind a paywall should mention, but I subscribed immediately, really valuable.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.700]   Jessica, for many years at the Wall Street Journal, where we quoted you all the time.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.700]   Actually, we still quote you.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.700]   You got a great scoop this week.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.700]   Susan Wojcicki, moving from ads to YouTube.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   She's taken over the home from Salar.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.700]   And it's an interesting move because Susan is the one who Google was built in her garage.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.700]   I mean, she was the first one.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   Her mom let at least the garage to the boys.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   And then Larry married her sister.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   Sergey.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700]   Sergey married her sister.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.700]   And then now Susan, has you been working at Google since that time?
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.700]   She has.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.700]   She was running all of ad products.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.700]   So ad sense, ad words, commerce, et cetera.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.700]   There's not much more important at Google than that.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   It's very important.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.700]   It kind of is a well-oiled machine at this point, though.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.900]   I think this is a new challenge and hopefully bringing that kind of operational experience
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.660]   to YouTube, which has some revenue problems.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.700]   They are getting less and less money for ad per ad, right?
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.700]   Revenue is growing, usage is growing, but they can't get the ad prices up.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.260]   And if they can't charge more and make individual ads more valuable, it's going to be tough
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.660]   to get to the next level and to get to more professional content like TV shows, sports,
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.660]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.700]   Part of the battle over YouTube is what should YouTube be?
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.700]   It really was a place for viral videos for a long time.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.780]   And I can see YouTube kind of trying to-- it feels like fit a square peg into a round hole
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.780]   thing.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.700]   No, no, this is where the networks are going to put their content.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.700]   And it doesn't really-- those two are not compatible, really.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.700]   They haven't been.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.700]   And I think the reason it's so complicated is we don't know where this whole market is going.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.700]   So there's so many players.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   It's not just YouTube, is it?
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.700]   And so I think everyone kind of wants a piece of it.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.700]   They want to be able to grab more and more content.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.700]   But YouTube is still in that base of viral, clips, promotional things.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.700]   Trump's shows now.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   They're channels initiative where--
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.700]   Wasn't that kind of a flop, though?
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.500]   It depends who you ask.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.060]   I think that there are definitely a lot of channels who said they could not build big
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.700]   businesses just off of it.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.700]   Right.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.300]   So they are continuing to invest in it.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.100]   But there are a lot of questions, but you can't ignore them because they've got the traffic.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.900]   They have the assets in that regard.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900]   Well, Steve--
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   Go ahead, Brian.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.740]   Oh, I was going to say what's been fascinating to me is to see an almost Wikipedia-type of
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.900]   aspect to the whole YouTube phenomenon.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.900]   Because you're right.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.900]   It used to be-- YouTube is where you saw cats on surfboards and people getting kicked in
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.900]   the nuts.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.900]   But now--
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.900]   Still do.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.900]   Well, sure, sure.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.900]   That's still there.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.100]   But what's amazing is to think about how many instructional things you go to find YouTube
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.100]   on.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.500]   Like, YouTube is a library.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.300]   It's where we go to learn how to perform CPR, to change a carburetor, to learn a magic
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.300]   trick.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.020]   I mean, it's like this instructional-- think about all of Khan Academy is based on what's
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.020]   great about YouTube.
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.860]   And the ability to tune in and learn how insulin inhibits blood sugar or whatever in
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.220]   a tight little five-minute lecture on there, I would like to think that that's what YouTube's
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.660]   legacy is really going to be.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.660]   But I don't know.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.660]   I don't know.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.260]   I'm looking popular on YouTube worldwide.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.340]   Pet squirrel hides his nut in the fur of a Bernie's dog.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.020]   In music-improve athletic performance, Jay Leno's heart felt goodbye.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.020]   That's NBC.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.180]   That's official.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.580]   And Honest Facebook movies.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.980]   You know, I want to watch that.
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.780]   They're not going to watch an ad, which I don't want to watch.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.780]   So I close it.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.780]   Well, I'll tell you--
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.780]   And there you go.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.780]   That's YouTube right there.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.540]   In a nutshell, I should have watched the squirrel.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.620]   The YouTube ad thing, that whole ability to skip ads and for them to now change ads
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.860]   to try to engage you in those first four seconds to get you just long enough to hang around
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.460]   and maybe watch the rest because I don't know exactly how those rules work behind the
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.900]   scene, but essentially, they only get paid if they watch the whole thing.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.380]   However, they're getting paid for a targeted viewer who's obviously engaged enough to
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.820]   sit in on purpose, choose to watch an ad, which you would think would be much more valuable
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:19.300]   than some just throwing it at the wall during a Super Bowl and hoping something sticks.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.300]   They have.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.020]   I mean, they've been innovating with a lot of formats.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.500]   So now we see the sort of small banner that pops up in the bottom of videos everywhere.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.820]   And YouTube was the first to try that.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.300]   But the bigger question is just, can you get the kind of content like sports that have
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.860]   significantly higher CPMs, full episodes of television shows?
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.860]   They're doing some of it.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.340]   I mean, I saw-- I watched the first episode of Girls this season on HBO or Promotional
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.740]   Thing I saw through YouTube.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.740]   You went on YouTube.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.740]   So--
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.740]   So fast.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.340]   But it will be over HBO's dead body that they put the whole season on YouTube.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.340]   It's promotional.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.340]   It's teasing.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.340]   It's marketing.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.780]   You wouldn't have seen that a few years ago.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.260]   So I think it's definitely a place to watch.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.260]   But--
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.980]   Well, I think we all watch YouTube a lot.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.900]   I just think it's hard to-- I think it's kind of hard to monetize because you just don't
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.020]   know what the environment's going to be.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.780]   You don't know if you're going to be on a squirrel video or a Leno goodbye video.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.340]   Well, there's clips.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.540]   YouTube's really good for clips, for short clips.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.540]   And there's that question.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.500]   And sometimes I go to YouTube to watch a movie trailer and there's an ad before it.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.500]   And I'm like, wait a second.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   I'm watching an ad.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.500]   See an ad for an ad.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.500]   I see that a little--
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.500]   I hate that.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.500]   That's a little bit strange.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.500]   My kids use it for music.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.700]   It's like the place you go if you want to listen to a song.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.700]   The songs--
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.700]   Yes.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.460]   And they're not even watching the video, even if there is video.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.580]   Because what YouTube has done really well is it's easy to upload things.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.420]   It's easy to find them.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:50.100]   And it's easy to jump to a particular moment in a clip too, which a lot of multimedia
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.340]   stuff on the web is really hard to-- like podcasts.
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.940]   You kind of can't discover podcasts.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.580]   But YouTube videos are really easy to discover.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.380]   You can actually put a key in the link that Joe's goes right to that spot.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.380]   Jumps to a certain number of seconds.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.100]   I don't know how many people know that, but it's in the share button.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.140]   And I did to Brian's point.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.900]   I changed the-- I got a replacement for my car stereo.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:15.100]   And it came with the typical impossible to decipher instruction manual about how to install
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   myself.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.300]   And I searched on YouTube.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.540]   And there was a dude out in the snow in Minnesota putting it in his car and freezing while he
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.620]   was doing it.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.780]   And I followed the YouTube video.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.540]   I got my laptop, put it in the car.
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.060]   And that's how I learned how to do it.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.140]   But I think the paper--
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.220]   That's Google's problem.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.140]   Because I bet you the search you did was a Google search, not a YouTube search.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.140]   Right.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.060]   And you found a list of instructions.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.060]   And it's some blog.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.620]   And what's embedded on the blog, but the YouTube video, he's getting free bandwidth for his
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.380]   video.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.980]   And I guess they could show an ad there.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.620]   But that's kind of the problem, isn't it?
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.620]   Right.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.620]   How do you add a month to it?
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.700]   In some ways, it isn't.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.260]   I mean, if that part, if there's a manufacturer for the part you're looking, and that could
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.020]   be a very highly valuable ad.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.260]   And does YouTube sellers, as that way, can they say--
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.260]   They can get pretty granular.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.780]   I mean, they can get into the type of content, type of audience.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.260]   I mean, that's the Google sort of engineering brains.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.260]   Right.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.260]   So they're good at that.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.260]   And that's what Susan Moji is doing.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.260]   Right.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.260]   And that's what Susan Moji is doing.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.260]   Very good.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.260]   That's what she's been doing.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.260]   Absolutely.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.460]   And doing that at scale and then getting all the partners to agree to that, to show that
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.420]   it's actually moving the needle for them.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.740]   So-- Well, and that's the biggest problem is a lot of the advertisers, they want to
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.380]   buy the certain personality.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.580]   They're like, we want to buy ads just on--
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.580]   Channeling Johnson Show.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.580]   Channeling Johnson Show.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.580]   Whatever.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.660]   And Google does not want that because that leaves their entire long tail unmonetized.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.700]   They're like, well, you say you want Ray William Johnson or whatever.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.500]   But what you really mean is you're males 18 to 24, making this kind of stuff.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.220]   And then we'll do that and it'll include this buy over here.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.300]   And that's what advertisers are not responding to.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.380]   Now, meanwhile, it does seem like a noble goal for them to try to get to happen because
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.620]   you just want it to hit that targeted audience.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.780]   But it seems like the people holding the purse strings are not a big fan of this idea that
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.380]   they can't buy individual personalities or shows.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.380]   Now, J.C.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.620]   Calhoun and our chairman says, I'm talking from the advertiser's perspective.
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.620]   And I am.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.460]   I mean, because there seems to be a disconnect between what we as users want from YouTube
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.380]   and what advertisers want from YouTube.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.540]   And it doesn't seem like the users are particularly interested in making a platform that Google
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.380]   can monetize.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.140]   And that's the challenge.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.860]   YouTube, the community of YouTube users is very easy to piss off.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.620]   And Google's done it many times before and they don't want to do it again.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:31.180]   And I think to another point that was brought up, I mean, even though we, it's unbelievable
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.780]   to us given how mature the web is, but video buyers are still largely TV buyers within
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:42.260]   agencies and they're still thinking of buying along those, along personalities and along
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.540]   shows and with the same kind of metrics as TV.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:50.460]   And that's the challenge for YouTube and everyone else, for Facebook, for Hulu to prove.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.540]   No guys think about it our way, not your way.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.540]   It's not an amazing thing.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.540]   Isn't that the weird part?
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.740]   Like inherently you would think that online advertising for whether it's Hulu or YouTube
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.260]   or whatever, you're able to do things that you could never do with traditional television
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.260]   ads.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.260]   That's a bad one.
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.660]   You could know specifically who saw it and in what condition and whether they skipped
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.820]   stuff ahead, you would think that all that would make online ads a premium that you would
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.820]   pay more than traditional advertising.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.940]   But instead we see the opposite.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.980]   We see these bargain-based enterprises.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.420]   Meanwhile, here's a video on YouTube NBC aired this video.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.100]   All visitors to Sochi Olympics immediately hacked.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.060]   By the way, this will guarantee that the show gets pulled from YouTube right away.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.500]   So we'll just go ahead and watch this.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.300]   We'll just talk constantly over it.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.300]   It's a noise.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   There you go.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   It's more brilliant.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.300]   So it's all for witty insights and parodies.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.540]   NBC's International correspondent Richard Engel working with a hacker, a hacker, a security
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:53.660]   expert from Trend Micro basically go ahead and play the audio.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:59.820]   And as Richard Engel found out upon his arrival there, it's not a matter of if but when Richard
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.860]   good evening.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.340]   So first of all, he's in this whole thing was shot in Moscow, not Sochi.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.340]   Good evening, Mark.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.340]   Just so you know.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.340]   Not just hacking.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.660]   The State Department warns that travelers should have no expectation of privacy even
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.260]   in their hotel rooms.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.580]   We know that because the guy in charge of Sochi said, "No, they are hacking hotel rooms.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.900]   We have cameras and we see them turn on shower in morning and leave on all day," which really
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.700]   kind of may mean nervous, but that's another story.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:32.260]   Especially exposed as soon as you try and communicate with anything.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.460]   One of the first things visitors to Russia will do is log on.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.460]   Hackers here.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.460]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.460]   Log on to what?
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.460]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.140]   So we decided to find out how dangerous that can be.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.300]   Kyle, welcome to Moscow.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.300]   Thank you.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.140]   With the help of Kyle Wilhoyt, a top American computer security expert.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   So they had three computers, each of which they pulled out of the box.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.340]   Without updates, they put them online.
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.700]   And then they went to websites, the same exact websites you could go to from right here.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.380]   It has nothing to do with Moscow.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.660]   We know this because the guy from Trend Micro blogged the details.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.820]   Nice job opening the Apple box.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.220]   Ever opened one of those before Richard?
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.220]   It's not the mic.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.220]   It's like they purposely designed those boxes to be a joy to open.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.220]   It tore it open.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.820]   It's like he's got meat hooks for hands and just like, "Rah!"
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.420]   I thought it was a FedEx box.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:31.260]   So from the producers of To Catch a Predator, it's to open an Apple box.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.380]   The only real detail, my name.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.300]   So you're putting my profile on these computers?
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.660]   That's exactly right.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:42.100]   With our new computers now loaded with potentially attractive data, we headed for a restaurant
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.780]   where we used a new smartphone to browse for--
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.780]   So cold.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.940]   Smart phones.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.300]   So apparently what he did is he goes-- they don't show this.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.300]   They did it out.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.980]   He goes into the Android phone, checks the boxes as a loud third party downloads.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.340]   And of course, you immediately get the warning.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.340]   That's a very dangerous thing to do.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.340]   Are you sure you want to do it?
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.340]   Yes, OK.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.420]   And then intentionally goes and downloads malware.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.420]   Knowingly.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.420]   Wow.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.420]   OK, but watch.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.420]   What happens next?
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   We were hacked!
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.420]   Ha!
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.420]   Yeah, I did.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.420]   Right.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.980]   It's actually downloading a piece of malware.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.900]   Because you asked it to.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.900]   It's after two.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.740]   Before we even finished our coffee--
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.260]   Coffee was also hacked.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.260]   More on that way.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.260]   The option to--
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.340]   So how did this blow up in their faces?
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.340]   How did it become clear--
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.980]   The guy from Trend Micro set this up, blogged about it.
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.140]   It's a nice one to be clear what actually happened.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.380]   Common sense, common sense.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.780]   Yeah, and he said later, you know, everything we did is exactly what you should not do.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.700]   And it didn't matter that they were a coffee shop in Moscow.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.180]   If you do it sitting right here at this table, it's the same websites.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:48.100]   They went to malicious websites and ran programs when the websites asked them to.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.740]   All the things you're not supposed to do.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.380]   But they edited it out.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.380]   What did they make?
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.380]   I can play it.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.700]   They make it look like there was no interaction at all.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.900]   They edited out the part where he downloads and says yes and runs the program.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.460]   Because Bursky Labs, one of the largest computer security companies in the world, is charged
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.380]   with protecting the games.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.380]   But ex--
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.740]   So when he made this blog post explaining all this, this was him trying to clear the air
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.340]   so that he didn't feel dinged on this, right?
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:20.820]   I kind of feel like he realized that in editing, it kind of looked a little different
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.340]   than it actually was.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.060]   The blog post is behind the scenes, behind the NBC honeypots.
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.820]   It's on the Trend Micro blog.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.300]   And he says, first, these attacks required some kind of user interaction.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.740]   Whether to execute the applications or open a Word document, all the attacks shown required
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.540]   user interaction, which was edited out.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.900]   Second, these attacks could happen anywhere.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:52.220]   Third, the infections incurred on newly unboxed hardware had basic security precautions,
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.540]   such as updating the operating system, been taken.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.540]   None of these would have happened.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.620]   In fact, I think they installed Java on the Macintosh because it said all the three computers
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.060]   had Flash and Java installed.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.060]   That means they--
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.060]   That doesn't ship with Flash or Java.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.740]   That means they actively installed malware vectors on the Mac.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.860]   It's a completely typical bogus story from NBC.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.500]   And no one's called them on except for this blog post.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.700]   I think there were some other blog posts that maybe provoked that one too.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.340]   So I think that security researchers are on it.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.340]   All right.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.060]   Just thought I'd give them a little plug.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.580]   You got to wonder what the thought process is.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.060]   NBC's got the Olympics.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.140]   There are so many controversies about the Olympics anyway that there's no end to what they can
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.780]   cover controversial about it if they want to.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.660]   And instead, they do this weird simplified story about computer hacking in Russia.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.580]   If I were John C. de Vorek, and this was a no agenda show, I would say there was an
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.660]   agenda in Russia to make the Russians look horrible.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:59.580]   The Soichi problems Twitter account, the pictures, many of which it turns out have been faked or
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.460]   misinterpreted about problems in the hotels and so forth.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.940]   It almost feels like there's a concerted campaign.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.500]   Is it just me that feels that?
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.740]   I think it's people jealous that they're not at the Olympics.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.300]   This is what I think it is.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.300]   It's Momo.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.300]   It's Momo.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.100]   You're having fun if you're over there and if you're not, you're like, "Oh, Soichi problems
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.700]   wouldn't want to be there."
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.300]   But we see this kind of thing.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:26.140]   Whenever there's a mold that we feel like stuff should fit in and there's any kind of
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:31.380]   evidence that seems to exactly fit in what we expect, we all have preconceived notions
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.580]   that everything's corrupt.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.340]   We've heard that there's going to be the most corrupt Olympics ever and we're worried about
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:41.060]   terrorism threats and Putin's put on a dog and pony show to cover up XYZ.
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:47.020]   We hear all that and then as a result, when we get a photo, whether it's doctored or not,
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.780]   it's hard to not instantly want to jump on it and pass it around.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.300]   So I don't know that it's a concerted campaign.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:57.580]   I think that there's just preconceived notions that we're hearing that when we see something
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:03.860]   that matches it, short circuits are critical thinking skills and instead we just immediately
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.860]   forward it.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.980]   Because to be honest, like this news story exactly fits what I imagine Russia is.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.180]   Russia's nothing but drunk people pirating at all times and hacking at all times.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.340]   You can't go across the border into Russia without getting hacked was the message of
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.740]   that piece and it was completely BS.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.260]   And I understand mainstream news does this because it's it generates their it's link
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.140]   bait their version of link bait.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.180]   The original story was really fair and then it was hacked.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.940]   That's what they don't want you to know.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.580]   That's it.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.180]   I don't understand why there would be this concerted anti-Russian campaign.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:49.060]   But there seems to be not that not that Putin isn't encouraging it by riding around topless
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.580]   on a horse.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.820]   But not that I would do anything like that.
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.260]   We're going to take a break and come back in just a moment.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.500]   Our show today brought to you by by a great panel shutters stock.com great panel.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:05.740]   We got a Jason Snell from IDG Jessica Lesson for the information which everyone must subscribe
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.740]   to.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.940]   I do love it just added in managing editor a new programmer.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.780]   He's going to write software for you.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.060]   Yeah, he's working on some new features already.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.820]   Isn't it interesting we're in the same boat where we're really a media startup.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.860]   But in the in this day and age your technology startup whether you like it or not.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.860]   Absolutely.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.380]   Because you have to solve all these issues these technology issues before you can get
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.180]   to your viewers or readers.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.580]   Brian brushwood host of a brand new show and National Geographic debuting February 27th
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.420]   hacking the system.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.020]   Yeah, yeah, stealing your stuff and blowing up your cars.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.700]   Yeah, and cheating your your salesman.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.700]   Really?
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.900]   Yeah, that's what we did.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.380]   We did a segment talking about psychological hacks that use car sales been used.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.100]   It's only fair because they always do that.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.260]   Oh, I got to go talk to the manager about this.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.100]   I don't know if we can give you this deal.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.100]   That's exactly.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.220]   We talk about the appeal to authority and we talk about how you can use the exact same
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.700]   trick on them by by saying like, well, it's not really up to me.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.700]   It's up to the wife.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.980]   And so you just call and then, you know, I'm sorry.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.340]   I can't give you a decision today.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.940]   I have to talk to the manager.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.940]   My wife.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.940]   Exactly.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.220]   Our show brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.660]   They have the perfect image or video for your next creative project.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.980]   So many blogs, we use Shutterstock.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.900]   So many blogs use Shutterstock because it always turns out when you post something on
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.700]   a blog, an image makes such a difference in a blog post, whether it's for your website
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:35.060]   or it's a publication, maybe you're doing advertising, a video, 28 million.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.140]   Actually, there's probably more.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.860]   I like to visit Shutterstock because the number goes up all the time.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:48.700]   Let's count 28 million high quality stock photos, illustrations, vectors and video clips.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.100]   It's more.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:58.740]   It's now 33,503,207, ladies and gentlemen, 273,000 new images this week.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.460]   Don't forget when you go to Shutterstock.com to try and you don't have to be a member,
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.180]   although I'll tell you why you might want to make an account.

[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.700]   Try the search engine because it's not just NAS.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:16.100]   Normally with a site like this, you'd be searching for Olympic rings, but you can also
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.140]   search for happy Olympic rings or green Olympic rings.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.420]   The search engine is incredible.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.300]   I'm typing in here just to see if it works.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.980]   I'm writing Olympic rings on fire.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.980]   I bet you could.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:28.980]   I bet you could.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.980]   Let me see.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:30.980]   Look at that.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.980]   Boom.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.500]   You got fire and you got Olympic rings on fire.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.100]   Of course, the Olympic torch.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.460]   Here's the deal.

[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.020]   You can share them with other people.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.180]   You can use them as inspiration.
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:53.260]   I have to say, sometimes just having an image gives me an inspiration for a blog post or
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.140]   an idea for a story.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.700]   Just the image gets you thinking along the lines you'd like to be.

[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.860]   So you can remember it easily.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.860]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.860]   Flappy Bird.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.860]   Flappy Bird.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:01.500]   A moment of silence for Flappy Bird.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.100]   It is no more.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.980]   I'll tell you what, man, I felt kind of bad.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.660]   I was late to the Flappy Bird.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.180]   No, no, no, you weren't.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.180]   No one was late.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.900]   It started a week ago.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.900]   You can't be late.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.380]   Well, I finally signed up.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.860]   I played exactly three games.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.460]   And I said, screw this.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.540]   And then uninstalled it.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.900]   And I was going to make a lot of hay crapping on the game.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.140]   But then, like all of a sudden--
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.420]   Yeah, you feel bad.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.860]   Yeah, all at once, like, apparently you've got to remember,
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.500]   there's a real developer who really wasn't trying
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.420]   to break your mind with amazing art.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.860]   You just wanted to make a dumb game with a flapping bird.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.380]   And his name is--
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.420]   Now the whole world's.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.980]   His real name is Dong, by the way.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.580]   I don't know if you know.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.460]   Dong Nguyen.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.820]   He is a Vietnamese developer, independent.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.180]   Now, here's the interesting story.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.500]   There is more to this Flappy Bird story.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.300]   I want the information to dig deep into this.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.300]   OK.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.300]   What questions do you have?
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.980]   So here's the deal.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.740]   I didn't know this.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.220]   The game came out in May.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.220]   Nothing for six months.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.180]   Nothing.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.180]   There are too many other games.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.180]   I mean, you've got to be like the game of the moment, right?
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.500]   I mean, you've got Candy Crush.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.300]   So how do you get discovered if you
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.260]   are a game that looks like Mario Brothers has literally
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.140]   no gameplay?
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.220]   All you do is flap.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.500]   And if you're lucky, you get through these things,
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.300]   which apparently some people can, to the degree of hundreds,
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.980]   I'm lucky to get through one crap.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.500]   Cheeto in the chat, showing me a screenshot of him
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.980]   having a score of 111, which I can't even wrap my mind around.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.340]   I've got two.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.340]   My best is five.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.660]   My best is five, yeah.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:38.420]   So nobody here knows anything about this game, except--
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.500]   and this is kind of interesting.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.820]   And somebody did the plot of this.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.340]   What was the link for that, John?
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.500]   I'm going to see if I can find that.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.860]   Somebody started plotting reviews in the App Store.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:55.420]   All of a sudden, they started to come in hot about December.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:00.260]   And the presumption is that Mr. Flappy Bird, Dong Nguyen,
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.620]   was buying reviews to jumpstart this.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.340]   And in fact, more than that, because he has several games,
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.300]   and they all started getting more reviews at the same time.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.580]   They all started to spike up.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:14.900]   Let's see.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.740]   This is Zach Will's blog.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:23.900]   He did kind of like a scrape of all the reviews.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.780]   We've all read the Virges story that Dong is making
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.340]   50,000 a day, $15,000 a day on the ads.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.220]   But here's the spike.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.540]   This is what's very interesting.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.020]   Nothing.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.300]   No reviews.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.820]   Sometime in late December, early January, he says,
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.300]   I'm guessing Dong Nguyen probably used some sort of service
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.900]   to download rate Flappy Bird on the App Store
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.780]   to generate buzz.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.300]   It worked.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.460]   Flappy Bird started getting 20 reviews a day.
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.420]   Then on January 9, 90 reviews.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.900]   On the 12th, it doubled.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.460]   At 17th, it doubled against.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.940]   Suddenly, it starts to take off.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.820]   And I presume at this point, it goes viral,
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.500]   and it's real reviews.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.380]   But if you read the reviews, and he does put some of them
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.980]   on here, you could see that there's
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:08.260]   a certain amount of similarity, the early reviews.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.780]   They all have this kind of morbid.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.460]   I'm going to kill myself.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.220]   This game is killing me.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.300]   I want to kill this guy.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.980]   The apocalypse, the death of me.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.580]   My life is over.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.380]   Don't do it.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.300]   Don't you do it.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.060]   My life is expiring, running out of control.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.300]   I'm going to kill myself.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.540]   These are all the first reviews coming in.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.140]   They all sound fake.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.940]   It's really interesting to watch this.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.060]   So it does take off.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.980]   It does go viral.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.900]   And I know it went viral.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:34.900]   It went viral around here.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.380]   Every one person downloaded, and all of a sudden,
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.380]   everybody's playing it.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.300]   I don't understand why.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.220]   I was talking to one of our interns here, Eli, who
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.940]   goes to a local high school.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.940]   How long did it take before everybody was playing it, Eli?
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.140]   Three days.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.820]   Every student playing it.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.420]   I don't know why.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.180]   There's something compelling about it.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.580]   Then yesterday, go ahead.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.060]   Well, I was going to say, Mr. Hacker, you know why.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.020]   Yeah, I mean, that's a testament to this is what Robert
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.740]   Chaldini calls a fixed action pattern, where it's like,
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.540]   we can't help but use as a short cut.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.620]   Wait a minute.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.220]   You're not making this up because the abbreviation fixed
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.060]   action pattern is FAP.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:13.660]   You're not making it--
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.940]   No, that's why when I do my talk about social engineering,
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.100]   I make sure to abbreviate it as FAP on their design.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.780]   OK, all right.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.060]   But yes, no, that is what it's called.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.180]   It's a mental shortcut that--
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.620]   like, for example, one of the classic ones
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.660]   was to Harvard did a study to see if you could cut
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.660]   in front of lines.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.940]   And so they've had a bunch of people
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.100]   waiting for a Xerox machine.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.020]   They had somebody go and ask different variations
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.940]   of the question, can I cut in line to do my stuff faster?
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.060]   And they figured out that the magic word was because.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.700]   As long as you use the word because,
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.700]   it's like the shortcut of their brain,
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.060]   they're like, well, she's got some reason so fine, go.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.060]   And even if it was a nonsense way to phrase it,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.180]   like, hey, can I jump in front of the line?
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.420]   Because I need to make some copies, and I'm in a rush.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.580]   Like, that's not an excuse.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.180]   That's not a reason.
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.660]   They're like, oh, you said the word because.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:58.980]   Go ahead.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.460]   Wow.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.260]   Likewise, that social proof is the reason
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.580]   that Yelp, of course, is so popular.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.380]   And to be honest, it's the reason that our joke experiment,
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.100]   the Diamond Club book, was such a success.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.580]   It's because so many people bought it all at once.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.100]   They all left fake reviews saying it was the best thing,
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.660]   since 50 Shades of Grey.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.500]   And of course, it was a hilarious fake, erotic fiction book.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.980]   And you're the king of gaming the system.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.540]   You know how to solve this stuff works.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:26.900]   Well, yeah.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.180]   And there's some part of me that obviously we all sneer
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.100]   and turn our nose up at the idea of buying reviews.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.140]   But I mean, how far off is it from me releasing a project
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.220]   and saying, let's all buy it at the same time.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.060]   And everybody like, comment, and subscribe at the same time.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:46.300]   And gaming the system, I guess the only benefit
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.900]   to when we do it within SFW is that we're transparent about it.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.660]   And we make it clear that this is a game that we're playing,
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.060]   whereas it feels-- it does feel smarmy and underhanded
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.460]   if it's a pay for service.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.740]   And Apple has been really trying to crack down on that.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.980]   And I don't know some secret system of how they do it.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.140]   But I mean, bots that download apps and--
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.660]   Right.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.740]   I mean, they're pretty much--
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.100]   or policing those left and right.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.980]   And so I am sure that they have checks looking
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.700]   for spikes in reviews and suspicious reviews
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.940]   and are also modern that closely.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.180]   So if they did go ahead and do that, which seems, I guess,
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.980]   very plausible, they would have had a lot of systems
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.860]   to circumvent.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.580]   And I bet a lot of things get caught, and maybe this one didn't.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.700]   What's weird is nobody denies the fact that it became viral.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.300]   I mean, legitimately viral, right?
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.140]   I mean, it did take off.
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.260]   Well, one of the things that the App Store charts
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.140]   are based on is velocity of downloads.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.420]   And so it's not even how many you have.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.420]   It's how fast it is.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.140]   So the hockey stick me.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.060]   It was number one in 12 countries.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.100]   Guy's making a ton of money.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.580]   Then yesterday, he tweets, I'm sorry, Flappy Bird users.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.660]   22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.900]   I cannot take this anymore.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.060]   And then he says, it's not related to legal issues.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.700]   I just cannot keep it anymore.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.020]   Then he says, I also--
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.860]   I don't sell Flappy Bird.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.820]   Don't ask, and I still make games.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.060]   And that's the last we've heard of him.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.580]   And a huge response on Twitter, by the way,
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.740]   if you search-- his Twitter handle is dongatory.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.180]   If you search for dongatory in FU,
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:23.300]   unbelievable vitriol on this guy.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.620]   I mean, do you think it is the case that he just couldn't--
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.860]   it's such an intentionally agonizingly difficult game?
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.740]   That's the one redeeming quality about it,
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.140]   is that it's genuinely hard, and it's hard for everyone,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.740]   and it is frustrating, but weirdly addictive.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.140]   Do you think he just hated the personal hate
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.500]   that he was getting from everyone?
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.380]   I'm telling you, I don't want to show this on screen,
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.820]   because it's so profane.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.420]   But if you care to do the search, I'm going right now.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.060]   Yeah, that's not good.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.860]   This is it.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.420]   This is the fire hose of the internet
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.580]   being turned on somebody who didn't really expect it.
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.300]   I think he was hoping he would make some money from his game.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.540]   And success--
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.540]   It's all in what?
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.060]   --until you're all the way up the top here.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.740]   But then he got the criticism that, oh, it
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.500]   was like this other game, and he was just a hack who
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.980]   took stuff off a shelf and all that.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.700]   And he became the focus of something.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.780]   And I think this guy was not interested.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.500]   He was very happy playing at the edges of this culture
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.660]   and make a little money on the side on a little game
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.460]   with some ads.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.620]   $15,000 a day.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.140]   I think that makes it so suspicious.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.980]   I don't think you just say, sorry, guys.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.380]   It's not like this is that hard to maintain.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.900]   You could just keep it up there and keep your mouth--
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.420]   It's Apple's server, right?
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.780]   I mean, there's something else going on.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.140]   You don't just turn down that.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.620]   It was on Android and iOS.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.220]   You were moving to it from both.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.280]   I can see Apple might have said, hey,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.860]   dong, you've got to do something about this.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.300]   But I don't know if Google did too, maybe.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.260]   I bet there's just something that spooked him,
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:53.540]   whether it's from the companies or from some sort of thread
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.100]   or something.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.660]   And so he's withdrawing.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.900]   We got more hate than Woody Allen last week.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.340]   I mean, this guy, for pulling a game,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.420]   I mean, just horrible Twitter.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.180]   No, someone's going to make Flappy Bird 2
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.360]   or change the name so that it's--
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:17.280]   Oh, there's 800 Flappy Bird already, 800 Flappy Bird clones.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.040]   I mean, you just go there.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.680]   There's Crappy Bird, there's Fartie Bird.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.160]   There you go.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.120]   You've got one on the Pebble.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:21.920]   I've got the Pebble.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.840]   It's a tiny bird.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.000]   I mean, you can't copyright Flappy Bird.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.680]   So Robert Scobel's theory--
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.040]   I think you're all going to say that with a straight face.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.280]   Robert Scobel's theory is it's great marketing in six months--
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:36.880]   He'll come out again.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.280]   --from the creator of Flappy Bird.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.180]   Oh.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.900]   Well, his last tweet is I still make games.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.940]   This feels like Justin Bieber retiring kind of most.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.140]   Is he just a brilliant marketing?
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.060]   I think this guy knows what he's doing.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.660]   If we assume that he primed the reviews
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.980]   and has been speaking to the people on Twitter, et cetera,
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.220]   this is not the last.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.580]   So we say, well played, Mr. Dong.
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.260]   Well played.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.420]   And Ashley has a response.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.580]   What?
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.780]   No more Flappy Bird.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.700]   Don't you think everybody now wants Flappy Bird
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.100]   because you can't get it anymore?
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.500]   That really increased the value of Flappy Bird.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.260]   There is an interesting angle here
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.620]   about what happens to all of this stuff that we use,
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.100]   all these apps and all when they go off the App Store.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:23.260]   And we have so many retro games on any of the layers
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.660]   and things from the past.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.340]   And in this App Store era where we've
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.540]   got all this DRM stuff on our phones and all that,
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.740]   Flappy Bird gets pulled.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.660]   I mean, if you delete it, you can't get it back.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.440]   And in 10 years, somebody's going to write about what Flappy
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.460]   Bird meant and it's going to be gone.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:44.960]   And it does make you wonder, this stuff all seems a lot less
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.940]   permanent than software used to seem back in the day.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.980]   Because you pull it off the store and it's gone.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   You can't have a backup somewhere that you reload.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.540]   And what the other thing is, there's so much money in it.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.620]   I mean, all of these clones, Flybirds, Flappy B,
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.700]   there's Flappy Penguin.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.420]   I saw an Android farty bird.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.700]   It's exactly the same game.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.520]   But you fart to get a crush.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.040]   Flappy Penguin.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.560]   I mean--
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.040]   Interesting.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.160]   That's not an iOS.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.640]   I just want to--
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.280]   Yeah, I know.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.760]   It seems that you used to have the market.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.760]   They cornered the market on the fart programs.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.800]   But that's just a sign that Android is an up and coming
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.040]   operating system.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   Or the App Store.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.800]   I'll tell you this much.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.760]   And actually, this is a legit speaking from the heart
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.280]   moment.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.520]   I'm kind of ticked that this is the dominating story
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.680]   on apps because there's a little game that came out
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.040]   this week that I love.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.880]   "Oka"-- "Three's" by Ashram--
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   "Three's."
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:41.080]   The guy who did "Puzzle Juice" just released a new one.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.340]   And I love it.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.080]   "Three's" I found a RIPAD?
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.240]   Yeah, I've got my phone here.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.840]   Is it Servo, LLC?
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.360]   Is that it?
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.720]   Is this it?
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.320]   Is it Pink and White and Blue?
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   "Dollar99?"
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:53.720]   Great game.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.120]   "Fantastic Game."
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.800]   What is it?
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.400]   It's a number game.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.920]   Yeah, but there's no real map.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.120]   Basically, you got ones of twos
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.440]   that you got to move--
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.600]   Mind it to "Three's."
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.920]   --position to make into a three.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.600]   And then after that, you're looking to take two identical
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.000]   numbers and mash them together to get bigger numbers.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.920]   But it's very Zen.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.280]   And it uses what I like about it is there are games that only
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.600]   use symbols and logic.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.480]   And so you're able to do things like listen to an audiobook.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.320]   And that part of your brain is not competing with the part
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.920]   of your brain that's moving your hands.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.880]   Like the moment I'm happiest is when I'm at the gym,
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.840]   working out on the elliptical or whatever.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.920]   And I'm playing a game that I'm manipulating symbols
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.880]   while listening to an audiobook that requires the language
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.320]   parts of my brain to be engaged.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.720]   You play "Three's" while listening to an audiobook.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.440]   Oh, sure.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.440]   Sure.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.240]   On the elliptical.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.320]   You're matching patterns and sliding things around.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.040]   It's got a really nice, actually, bunch of audio.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.880]   It's got some voices for the different pieces on the board
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   and some music that plays in the background.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.840]   Very smart game.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.120]   Really, really nice game.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:37:59.640]   You'll get it.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.720]   And this is also-- you could tell, especially
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.760]   since he did puzzle juice, you could really see the way he's
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.880]   developed a game-- like, for example, here,
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.640]   this tutorial, you're going to be playing the game right now
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.120]   where it is.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.520]   So you're just moving stuff around until it hit--
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.080]   go until you hit a wall and then the line up.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.320]   And then you can mash them together.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:16.960]   Keep going.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.720]   Now you've made a three.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.480]   I've learned.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.920]   And that was auspicious.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.520]   It was very good word.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.040]   Yes.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.520]   New numbers here.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.560]   But in this case--
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.920]   and it's got the right kind of blend of random reinforcement.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.880]   You're sort of hoping to get the right kind of numbers
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.600]   at the right time.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   But you'll catch a run and everything
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.280]   will go crazy.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.320]   You can't believe you're getting all these points.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.840]   Other times, you die almost instantly.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.760]   Yeah, there's a Tetris-like aspect to it
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.560]   where what comes through in the stack onto the board
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.240]   will have an impact on whether you can make it or not
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.640]   that I really like.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.120]   It is good.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.640]   All right.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.400]   I like it.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.680]   What I like it is the numbers that come in are both your enemy
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.400]   and that you want to destroy them to free up the stage.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.080]   Just like Tetris.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   But they're also your ammunition.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.520]   Yeah, very much like Tetris.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.960]   Oh, two will only add with one.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.600]   Well, how do I know that?
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.080]   Three.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   How do I--
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.520]   because it's threes.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.800]   I just thought this was the first time I've seen--
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.960]   You're a ringer, aren't you?
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.680]   But it's like you guys already got it.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.200]   No.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.080]   So how long do you guys think you'll be playing?
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.320]   Brian, I mean, how long do you think you can--
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.080]   three will capture your imagination?
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.920]   That's always amazing to me about these games.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.680]   You're talking to a guy who had played--
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.600]   what I like about it is that it reminds me of Drop 7, which
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.600]   was a game that I played for easily seven years,
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.480]   like-- or I guess six years since it came out.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.080]   And it's just one of those things where you just become
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.280]   obsessed with it.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.920]   And it's something I could do that doesn't--
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.400]   like I say, it doesn't require the language part of the game.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.800]   Everybody in our audience is now downloading threes.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.360]   I can't believe--
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.520]   Brought to you, bye.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.020]   Three.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:50.920]   I just gave you a crack.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.680]   By the way, this is another thing that is--
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.600]   and I'm sure you've observed this, Brian--
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.200]   these rewards, even if it's not coins coming from a slot
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.320]   machine.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:39:59.800]   Sure.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.440]   These little rewards are what keep you going.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.360]   And timing them in a game is so important.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.440]   Is this a social game?
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.640]   Can you play against people?
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.560]   No.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.520]   Game-- I'll tell you.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.080]   I became very--
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.160]   it's the first time I've ever cared about game center,
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.240]   because I can compare my score to--
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.120]   like my old assistant, John Tilton,
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.040]   lives on the other side of the country now.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.880]   But I won't call him until my score is higher than his.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.760]   So that I could be all, hey, what's up?
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.120]   I'm sorry, I'm busy playing threes.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.680]   Yeah, the high score element is definitely
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.200]   where the social interaction is.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.520]   But your own high score, too, right?
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.280]   I mean, you're trying to beat yourself, I guess.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.960]   Yeah, it actually does a very good job
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.200]   of that it keeps a record of all the games you played sorted
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.960]   by highest score.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.720]   So you can look back easily.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.160]   Every time you finish a game, you
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.800]   can see where your current game ranked versus your very best
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.560]   games that you played, which is also really smart.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.520]   What's cool, too, is like you know
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.400]   that what your goal is, of course, you want to stay alive.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.080]   But in this case, you're out of moves.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.840]   And that's the danger you get is as you do better,
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.200]   you hit this point where very quickly you start to realize
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.080]   you're in trouble and you shift the way you play from being,
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.560]   you know, all about getting the points.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.840]   And instead, you're all about clearing out space
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.200]   so you can stay alive.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   So good news.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.120]   That's a Tetris aspect.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.880]   We have a replacement for Flappy Burs.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.120]   It's just that easy.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.560]   Right, the threes will get knocked off
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.480]   just like a letter press got knocked off.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.000]   But you know--
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.280]   I still play a letter press.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.400]   It's a great game, too.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.160]   So yeah.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.920]   Yeah, I think the reminds me of a letter press.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.160]   And it's got-- yeah, it's got some classic--
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.240]   It does seem to be that hockey stick up and down.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.920]   I'm thinking of OMG Pops draw something, which was very,
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.200]   very viral, but also died very quickly as well.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:41.720]   Interesting.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.640]   Man, you want to talk about the sale of the decade, Ben.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.360]   Oh, timing.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.760]   It was amazing to see that.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.160]   Good thing, yeah, right?
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.660]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.680]   For how much does it get?
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.360]   Hundreds of millions, right?
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:53.960]   It was ridiculous.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.840]   Let me see if I can find the actual figures here.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.800]   So this is kind of running against the trend,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.760]   because threes does not have in-app purchases, right?
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.040]   Right.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.640]   It's $2.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.160]   Just $2.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.880]   So OMG Pops sold for $210 million
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.760]   based on the success of that one game of draws on something.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.160]   Less than a year later, the entire studio closed.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.440]   See, that's what the creator of Flappy Burs
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.440]   is missing out on.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.280]   Right.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.120]   Is just--
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.880]   If you get to help that--
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.240]   Wait another week, and somebody will buy you for $200 million.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.320]   Why there's fishiness.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.240]   There's fishiness.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.160]   See?
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.880]   She's got a nose for news.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.080]   There is fishiness.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:29.600]   You're the thing.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.280]   I don't care how many hate tweets
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.800]   that you're getting $50,000 a day.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.320]   Exactly.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.280]   It's utterly remarkable.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.960]   You shut the hell up, and you deal with it.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.920]   And unless you are hiding something,
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.760]   you know what I mean?
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.240]   Unless you're worried that all this attention is
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.120]   going to cause a problem for you.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.480]   Well, I mean, that is quite possible.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.360]   But I want to leave a little bit of space open for the fact
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.560]   that this is a young software developer who was taken aback
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   by the attention and is really sensitive
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.360]   and maybe couldn't deal with it emotionally.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.920]   I've known some software developers
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.600]   who shut down their company and walked away
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.260]   because they couldn't deal with the customers
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.000]   or they had something else going on in their lives.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.400]   And this exacerbated it at the point
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.880]   where they felt it was wrecking their lives
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.640]   and they walked away.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.960]   And that could be the case here.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.040]   It's also possible that something is happening
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.800]   that we don't know about.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.720]   But his tweets seem pretty distressed to me.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.240]   So I mean, there's a cultural difference there,
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.200]   a language difference.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.280]   We may be filtering it through our own predisposition
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.480]   to making as much money as you possibly can.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.760]   If he was making $50,000 a day for a month,
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.160]   he's got a million and a half in the bank.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.440]   He may never have to work again.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.120]   He might have just said, you know, this is fine.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.400]   See, well, and plus also when you're that young
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.720]   and you have a hit, you have a tendency to believe like,
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.040]   oh, well, then I could just make hits whenever I feel like.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.960]   And I could see making that kind of rash decision.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.280]   And yet there's more to it because he had three games.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.800]   He promoted them all in the same way.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.760]   One went viral, then he disappeared.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   I think it's a fascinating story.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.760]   I look forward to it.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.000]   To be continued for sure.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.920]   Flappy Bird's two electric boogaloo
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.240]   will be out in a couple of months.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:11.760]   I buried the lead.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.960]   We have a new CEO at Microsoft.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.800]   Comes right after Flappy Bird.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.560]   I started with Friday.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.640]   And OK, we're going to get to that in a second.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.520]   Holy cow, I'm looking down the rundown.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.040]   Oh, yeah, such a Nutella.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.760]   OK, already we're bored with him.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   And he's only been in power for four days.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.280]   Or guys, he made Flappy Bird, and I don't care.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.840]   Scoop by Flappy Bird's.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.040]   Our show today brought to you by Carmonite on line backup.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.880]   God, I got to call it.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.280]   I get this every week on the radio show because radio
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.480]   shouldn't normal people listen to.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.680]   Guy calls up, says, yeah, my screen doesn't work anymore.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.480]   Three of my keys on my HP laptop don't work anymore.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.760]   But all of my photos are on that hard drive.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.680]   What do I do?
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.480]   He said, is it time to get Carmonite?
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.640]   He said, it was time to get Carmonite.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.280]   Dude, he said, well, I do have an external hard drive.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.080]   And I press the button.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.040]   And it backs up every night.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.960]   But I get up in the morning and it says 0%.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:05.960]   Is that a bad sign?
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.760]   I said, yes, you don't have a backup.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.440]   And your computer is dying.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.840]   Please have a backup strategy.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.480]   And if you do, remember one thing.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.240]   When you back up, you got to do--
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.160]   I think you got to do three to one backup.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.400]   Three copies, not one.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.640]   Moving your file to a drive named backup does not
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.000]   a backup make.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.040]   You have to have at least two.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.560]   I say three copies.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.800]   You're going to have two different forms of media.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.040]   One can be an external hard drive,
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.080]   but one's got to be off site.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.200]   If it's sitting next to your computer,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.720]   we have flash flood warnings.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.400]   Did your alarm go off on the phone?
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   Mine didn't.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:41.800]   That was a--
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.520]   It was like those old style radio alerts.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.520]   [BUZZER]
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.200]   That happened to me this summer when we were in Cincinnati.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.440]   There was a flash flood warning.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.640]   Woke us all up at two in the morning.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.640]   So we'll talk about that.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.760]   I was on an airplane just about to take off.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.000]   And there was an amber alert that got pushed.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.800]   And the entire plane, all at once, just went--
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.320]   [BUZZER]
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.440]   That's what happened in this studio.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.840]   All of our phones went off.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.240]   All of a sudden, I was on the air.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.520]   In any event, that's the flash floods.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.520]   You can lose your data.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.480]   You can lose your data.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.680]   If it's next to your computer, they will both burn in a fire
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.440]   or get flooded.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.240]   And it doesn't matter.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   You got to be off site.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.520]   So a good backup strategy would be--
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.120]   let's just now do a little thinking.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.640]   Automatic, so you don't have to remember it.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.880]   Continuous, so you change a file and it's backed up.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.400]   Off site, to the cloud maybe.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.520]   And that's what Carbonite does.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.880]   And it does it very affordably less than $5 a month
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.120]   for everything on your computer.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.880]   And it doesn't matter how much you have.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.400]   They don't meter the storage.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.080]   $59.99 a year for everything on a Mac
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080]   or a PC they have.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.280]   If you go to Carbonite.com, they've
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.360]   got plans for small businesses, external drives,
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.640]   always one low, flat, yearly rate.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.760]   Plus, you can access those backup files anytime.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.160]   Just log on to your Carbonite account
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.240]   or use the free apps.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.360]   It is a great solution for backup.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.240]   And you know, probably there are people you know,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.760]   people who watch the show are certainly smart enough
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.080]   to have good backup solutions.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.480]   But they're probably people who you know who don't.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.640]   Your mom, your dad, your sister, your brother.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.520]   The teacher, the pastor, help them.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.400]   Show them Carbonite.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.600]   Carbonite.com.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.040]   Do tell them to use the offer code TWIT
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.720]   because they'll get two free bonus months when they buy.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.960]   Two weeks to try it.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.200]   No credit card needed just the word TWIT.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.960]   Two bonus months when you decide to buy Carbonite.com.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.320]   So, Sacha Nadella.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:35.720]   You know, there was a lot of drama
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.440]   around this Microsoft CEO search.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.680]   Alan Malali came up.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.440]   Former Microsoft folks.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.880]   Couple of guys in Microsoft beside Nadella.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.480]   Tony Bates, the Skype CEO, was brought in during the acquisition.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.760]   Stephen Elop brought in when the Nokia acquisition closed.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.280]   But I think everybody looked at Sacha Nadella and thought,
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.320]   this is the guy who's been in Microsoft 22 years.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.440]   The obvious choice, not the inspiring choice.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.520]   - I had a tough choice though.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.280]   I mean, I think what it came down to is the fact
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.760]   that this is a tough job running Microsoft right now.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.560]   - Almost under the-- - It's really more than one job.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.160]   And so I think the most interesting thing
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.720]   about the announcement was the return of Bill Gates
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.440]   as a technical advisor spending a third of his time now
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.440]   back at Microsoft.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.280]   And we don't know what that will be.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.560]   And I'm sure for a while they will downplay it.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.440]   But he changed his position on the board
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.000]   so that he could officially step in,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.280]   spend a third of his time.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.920]   And I think that's a recognition that Microsoft
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.000]   is somewhat ungovernable.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.160]   - Your old newspaper, The Journal,
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.480]   said that over and over again.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.600]   They said nobody wants this job because A, it's too tough.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.640]   And B, nobody wants to work for a board
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.560]   run by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer who also--
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.640]   - Steve Ballmer, yeah.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.920]   - Nadella also got a seat.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.280]   So all three CEOs on the board.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.120]   John Thompson takes the chair position,
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.040]   which makes a lot of sense.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.240]   Former IBM executive, he led this search.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.720]   The rest of the board really are kind of non-entities.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.640]   They almost feel like rubber stamp board members, frankly.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.960]   So it's really, the thought was,
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.320]   and The Journal said this over and over again,
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.240]   nobody wants this job because they don't want to
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.200]   have these guys breathing down their necks.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.840]   - Yeah, I think it's also, we don't really know.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.600]   So I mean, we know that Alan Malali sort of
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.200]   took himself out in some ways according to himself.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.600]   I mean, it's very hard to get a handle on
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.120]   how many actual candidates they were.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:31.960]   I've seen that.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.360]   - The guy took his name out.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.200]   Yeah, they said 100.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.040]   They said 100.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.800]   - They said 100, I think.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.680]   I'm sure there was a lot of outreach,
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.480]   but at the end of the day, I think it was fairly obvious
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.920]   it was gonna be Satya in part because,
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.840]   you know, you've got to have someone
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.360]   who understands Microsoft and its current form.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.240]   - That's, my money was on him all along,
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.720]   but they did have this perception that there's no vision.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.560]   This is just gonna be kind of a vanilla choice.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.680]   And I think moving Bill Gates into the,
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.760]   quote, visionary role probably is a response to that.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.240]   It also solves one problem,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.000]   'cause if Bill's not the chairman of the board,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.440]   maybe he's not so overpowering.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.280]   Maybe he's there.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.440]   - That was my question is this,
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.040]   is this getting Bill Gates more involved
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:14.960]   to get him more involved,
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.800]   or is it getting him to not be the chairman
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.280]   so that if Nadella needs to make some tough decisions
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.600]   about going in a different direction from Bill Gates
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.160]   and Steve Palmer, is he gonna be able to do that?
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.120]   Or is Bill Gates gonna be their three over shoulder
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:27.960]   through this?
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.600]   - Doesn't matter what chair he's sitting in the border.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.720]   He's still in the border. - It's still in the border.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   - And now he's at the company more often.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.520]   And I think that if you read the sort of anonymous quotes
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.760]   being bandied around from insiders,
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.360]   it's all about what is that relationship gonna be like?
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.960]   Is he gonna have an office?
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.800]   So I think that what's interesting now is to see
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.840]   what the strategy is going forward
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.920]   if they decide to sell off some stuff,
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.320]   which has been talked about.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:57.520]   If the sort of bomber Nokia mobility push
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.360]   is gonna be the sort of driving vision in the same way,
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.560]   what that deal is gonna look like.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.840]   And it'll be interesting.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.280]   I mean, I think that everyone in tech wants to see
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.320]   some sort of decisive action,
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.040]   sort of moving in different ways,
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.440]   not just the same old same old,
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.720]   but the company's making money,
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.000]   it's doing fairly well,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.320]   same old same old might be sort of what we see too.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.800]   - What consumers want is very different
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.040]   from what the stock market wants,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.320]   is very different from Microsoft employees
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.440]   and executives want,
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.880]   there are a lot of constituencies here to deal with.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.320]   - I just wanna know if this is gonna be the return
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.960]   of Bill Gates's "The Devil" talk,
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.320]   'cause you remember like late 90s,
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.800]   everyone knew the Bill Gates was a devil,
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.200]   and then he spent a decade curing malaria,
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.520]   and then they're like, "Oh, I guess he's all right."
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.360]   - He's all right now.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.640]   - Now that he's back, is that--
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.160]   - And we had this conversation on Windows Weekly,
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.600]   of course, on Wednesday with Paul Thorett
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.440]   and Mary Jo Foley,
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.720]   and one of the points they brought up
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.720]   is Bill hasn't really been involved in Microsoft
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.560]   and quite some time.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.000]   He spent all his energy on saving the world,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.520]   and what is Bill gonna say?
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.920]   You know, I don't think the ribbon on the toolbar
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.280]   is quite right, you wanna move that a little left,
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.840]   or is he gonna say, you know,
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.200]   maybe tablets aren't the same,
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.640]   I mean, it's gonna be much higher level advice.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.280]   - Seems like he's getting hands-on with the code
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.120]   or making--
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.680]   - My suspicion is what Gates is gonna be doing
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.560]   is he's there to back up Satcha.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.400]   Satcha's faced against, you know,
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.040]   he's just really weird to have a board
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.800]   with all three CEOs of a company on the board.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.840]   Satcha's gonna, he's an inaugural address Satcha said,
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.320]   it's software, he said software again and again and again.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.600]   He said, no, Microsoft's new slogan,
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.680]   or new tagline is devices and services,
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.600]   we're a devices and services company,
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.640]   but he said again and again,
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.920]   but it's the software that runs on the devices
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.360]   and services that really matters.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.920]   So what I think Bill's job is to go,
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.880]   yeah, yeah, Satcha's right.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.640]   It's, he's there, so Satcha could go to the board
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.480]   and have a guy in his corner.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.520]   - That's very feasible to me, you gotta wonder,
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.920]   I mean, the CEO of Microsoft should not need backup.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.760]   I mean--
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.600]   - This is an unusual position though.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.560]   - And so, it is an unusual position.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.840]   And I think it could work quite well.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.160]   You know, I was sort of chuckling,
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.800]   Microsoft sort of did the dog and pony show of PR for this,
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.520]   so on the web, you know, there's,
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:20.520]   who is Satcha Nadella in the video of him walking down the hall
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.040]   with the interviews, you know, so,
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.440]   it's a huge company and it's a huge role,
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.400]   but I did chuckle at the sort of branding campaign around it,
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.680]   but it, I'm really watching to see
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.960]   if there's any deals done.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:33.800]   I mean, it--
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.880]   - If Satcha Nadella thinks that Microsoft is never really
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.320]   gonna have a market share presence for Windows Phone
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.720]   and for tablets that are running Windows as a tablet,
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.640]   does he have the ability to say guys,
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.800]   we need to focus on the cloud,
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.200]   we're doing great in the cloud,
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.760]   we've still got the base Windows business,
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   that's a great business, they can talk about Xbox.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.600]   - That's where the--
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   - And where that comes from, by the way, is Azure
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.760]   and Business Enterprise.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.720]   - Right, which are doing great.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.960]   I'm not sure anybody at Microsoft really wants to turn
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:08.760]   Microsoft into IBM, but that's my question is,
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.640]   does he have the latitude to say guys, you know,
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.520]   this phone stuff and the tablet stuff,
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.560]   still, you know, it's gonna be iOS and Android,
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.400]   it's not gonna be us.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.800]   Let's focus on being the backend services
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.320]   for all of those apps and not worry about this,
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.560]   or is there just too much pride invested in that
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.400]   for Microsoft?
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.400]   - I think it's hard to get out of the mobile phone business
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.920]   right now, I mean, it is hard to just give that up
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.000]   and I mean, they've tried and tried and are trying again
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.440]   and there's not a ton of movement,
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.160]   but I think it's hard to give that up and, you know,
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.520]   Azure, they are not the backend for the mobile phone
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.760]   business, they're the backend for the legacy PC business.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.240]   And so, you know, I think that it's hard to see them
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.320]   giving that up, but, you know, Xbox, what do you do with that
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.920]   and does that belong somewhere else?
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.080]   What do you do with some of these hardware projects
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.040]   like Surface and other stuff?
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:59.080]   But I think I don't see how Microsoft can be relevant
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:02.760]   without pushing forward and mobile, but I think,
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.840]   you know, that was the bomber strategy and
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.600]   it's too early to say, but I think the Xbox is one to watch
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.600]   and you know, this has been floated out there,
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.280]   people wondering if you could get rid of that
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.880]   and focus things a bit and what to do with Excel business.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.040]   >> The stock market is just indifferent to the whole thing.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.040]   I mean, this is one of the things that's been
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.080]   a conundrum for so long.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.040]   Microsoft makes a lot of money and the stock has been flat
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.160]   for a decade.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.520]   >> Oh, they like growth, right?
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.840]   And Microsoft is just throwing out its profit.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.360]   It's the same thing that's going on with Apple stock right now.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.320]   It's like, oh, these are really boring companies
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.240]   'cause they're not growing as fast as they used to.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.520]   They're ridiculously profitable,
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.080]   so it's a great business for them to be in,
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.440]   but if you're an investor, you want growth.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.760]   It's just a different kind of company.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.160]   >> I mean, I guess that's the problem is,
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.400]   is one of the things that makes the stock market
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.960]   an efficient market is that it factors in excitement
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.880]   about a company as an actual commodity.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.960]   And once that factors in, then yeah,
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.280]   it makes sense that everything would be flat
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.960]   'cause you're not actually buying it just with the intention
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.640]   of sitting there and collecting dividends oftentimes,
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.000]   you're buying it with the expectation
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.560]   that the stock itself will grow over time.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.080]   What do you do if you're sat in a dilemma?
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.280]   Do you, you can't kill phone because you just bought Nokia?
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.920]   >> I think you have to buy some other big stuff.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.120]   So I also think we're gonna start,
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.320]   I think where you see some really, really big deals
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.160]   in the tech space company.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.000]   >> Interesting.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.400]   >> Because you've got a ton of cash
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.400]   and you've got valuations pretty high,
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.480]   which is good if you're an acquiring company
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.280]   and you can agree on the valuation.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:33.000]   Google's on a rampage, which we've written a bit about,
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.520]   but I mean, you could buy eBay.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.400]   That's what I would do if I were Microsoft, I'd buy eBay.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.920]   I mean, I don't think you can, or at least the PayPal part of it
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.320]   maybe, but those are the kind of moves.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.040]   And I know it's easy to say sitting back
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.200]   without being in the thick of things,
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.520]   but we're gonna see a lot of, I think,
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.560]   where at this level of sort of stagnant growth
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.400]   on a lot of things in Apple and elsewhere
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.920]   and what's gonna move the needle,
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.000]   it's gonna be getting different skill sets
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   and different products into these organizations
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.440]   and leveraging them.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.880]   >> Apple has $137 billion cash in the bank,
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.080]   of course, famously a lot.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.840]   Look at that, Microsoft's number two,
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.160]   $68 billion in the bank, Google $48 billion,
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:15.560]   Cisco $45 and Oracle $34,
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.560]   that's a lot of money just sitting there.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.360]   Apple historically has been very reluctant
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.320]   to spend the money, partly 'cause it's offshore.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.360]   You can't, you know, these tax consequences.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.200]   >> This week, Tim Cook said, not only that Apple
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.840]   has bought a really surprisingly large number of businesses
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:30.760]   in the last year that we don't really hear about all of them.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.840]   >> They're tiny though, but yeah.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:32.800]   >> But they were all small.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.640]   And then he said, and you never know,
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.560]   we might need to drop $100 billion on something sometime.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.680]   And it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.600]   >> That's what he always says when Carl Icahn
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.520]   and others are in the way of agitating.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.960]   And I also think, you know, Apple's really striving
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.040]   to not appear boring right now.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.480]   So at every twist and turn, they remind us
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.720]   they have new products coming
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.520]   and they're not opposed to doing big deals.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.360]   >> They never know.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.280]   >> Something might not have never known.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.040]   >> But your right icon has been saying,
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.400]   give us the money, pay a big dividend,
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.800]   give us back to the stockholders.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.920]   >> I mean, they've paid a dividend.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.640]   It was one of the first thing Tim Cooks did
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.880]   and his watch that Steve had always resisted.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.960]   >> But I can't, I can't once more.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.160]   >> But you're right, it's hard to imagine Apple
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.200]   integrating a company that large into their culture anyway.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.760]   >> It's a good thing Tim Cook just saying, oh no, Carl.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.000]   I gotta save it for a rainy day.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   You never know, that's my mad way.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.920]   >> And I think they do look constantly.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.760]   And I would imagine that they looked at all sorts
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.480]   of crazy things we'd be shocked at.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.640]   But I think that it's very different from looking
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.800]   and pulling the trigger.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.600]   But I'm bracing myself for very big,
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:34.760]   some mega deal, maybe.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.680]   >> Interesting.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.400]   >> I do think that Microsoft,
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.600]   and not just for our benefit
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.800]   because it would be fun to talk about,
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.960]   but I do think Microsoft needs to focus,
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.000]   and needs to change some of its business.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.800]   It is trying to be so many different things.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:50.040]   And I think sometimes at the disservice to its products,
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.840]   I think Windows Phone is a better product
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.480]   than maybe it has been treated as by them.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.880]   I think right down to the name being,
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.840]   we got everything Windows everywhere,
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.920]   maybe was a liability to that product.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:05.480]   >> Isn't that one of Microsoft's greatest sins of all time
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.920]   is insisting on putting their stupid name on everything?
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.560]   Like from a branding perspective,
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.640]   you want a name to mean something.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.720]   And Microsoft can't mean high-end enterprise solution
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.440]   and also a kick-ass video game console.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.080]   Yet they insist on putting that on there.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   >> Really, you can't.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   >> I mean, Xbox seems like such a great wedge
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.600]   for Microsoft in the living room.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.360]   >> Right, but if they were naming that product today,
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.720]   they would call it Windows Game.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.480]   >> Which would be a mistake, obviously.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.120]   >> And I don't understand why can't they just own,
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.640]   why does Xbox have to be branded
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.320]   underneath the Microsoft Mega logo?
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.080]   Why can't Xbox be its own company that Microsoft--
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.400]   >> Do you think it hurts in the world?
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.640]   >> It hurts Xbox because it is.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.400]   >> I think it hurts Microsoft's brand.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.600]   I think it hurts both of them.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.680]   I think I don't like Microsoft in my game console,
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.600]   and I don't want game console in my Microsoft.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.720]   Microsoft means enterprise solutions.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.080]   And they should have embraced that.
[00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.480]   >> Well, I think that's OS.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.160]   >> One thing that's true, that Microsoft doesn't want
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.560]   to go the IBM route and become the enterprise solutions,
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.160]   services company.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.280]   The devices is equal to services in Microsoft's new
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.640]   way of looking at things.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.160]   That's why they do Surface, which is the first ever computer
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.120]   made by Microsoft.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.240]   They do tablets, and they do Xbox.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.080]   Those are the devices.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:20.920]   >> And they bought no idea.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   >> What are your devices and phones?
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.000]   I mean, that's a third of their device portfolio.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.520]   By the way, I didn't realize this, but Apple,
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.000]   in the last couple of weeks, did repurchase $14 billion
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   in shares.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.120]   They did spend some of that cash because of their
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:38.240]   poor stock showing after showing an incredible record profit.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.360]   Okay, it's all confusing to me.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.720]   Tim Cook spoke to The Wall Street Journal,
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.640]   and boy, I tell you, Apple's really good at getting the press
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.040]   because he said, among other things,
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.520]   we have some very exciting new categories,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.520]   and the world goes crazy.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.440]   >> You got to alert Apple has new products coming in the future,
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.280]   shocking.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.800]   >> He says, there will be new categories we're not ready
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.640]   to talk about.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.720]   Hasn't he said this like every year for less than a year?
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.280]   >> I think he said this at all things D last year,
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.200]   last spring.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.040]   I mean, this is, he's been saying them for a while now.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.600]   >> That's really great stuff.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.440]   He said, anyone reasonable would consider what Apple is
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.920]   working on his new categories.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.320]   Now, I want to tell you on secret,
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.720]   I saw that Apple's working on a living room device
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.840]   with a transparent remote.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.520]   >> Well, it must be true.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.360]   >> It's good for you.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.720]   >> As we know this week,
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.160]   I mean, the number of journalists who's wasted time chasing
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.200]   rumors on secret, I was actually going to put a few fake
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.360]   ones out there to ruin the competition.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.000]   >> No, I'm glad you're not in my head.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.240]   >> I didn't, I didn't, but it's, well, first of all,
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.280]   we know Apple has been working on a living room device
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.200]   and television device, all that.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.520]   Now, I do think the watch is getting close.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.640]   And I mean, I think this is what-
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.040]   >> The drum beat seems to be mounting.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.440]   Now, there's, by the way, there's no one better than Jessica
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.760]   has ever seen that.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.040]   >> I think it's a good thing.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040]   >> I think it's a good thing.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.880]   >> I'm a little bit of a joke about Apple.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.880]   I don't know if you're a fan of Apple.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.880]   I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:59.880]   >> I think it's a really good thing.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:01.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.

[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:19.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.

[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.

[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.

[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880]   >> I'm a fan of Apple.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.680]   >> I think it's just they are so far behind Google in terms of the years of experience
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.400]   and learning from the data and in the capabilities.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.200]   I think they also underestimated how hard a problem that was.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.200]   But if they've learned from that --
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.000]   >> I was going to answer your question, Leo.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.640]   I will say like Siri, I think they absolutely have nailed it on.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   >> No.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   >> I think that --
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   >> No.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   >> They --
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   >> Siri is half-baked.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640]   Google surpassed them immediately.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.880]   >> And probably Siri is -- it doesn't talk to anything really yet, too.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:21.520]   So Siri is a great example of where they had a great interface and a very nice sort of
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.520]   version one.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.160]   >> It doesn't talk to anything.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.640]   >> It doesn't talk to anything.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   It does.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.200]   >> The app they bought did more.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.400]   I can make reservations.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.680]   >> Well, but again, we're talking about perceptions.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.640]   In that regard, I think that Siri, like first of all, the way they've crafted the personality
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.640]   I think is very smart.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:42.720]   I think that the snarky answers and the -- oh, I've tried asking Siri this stuff.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.120]   It's definitely underutilized and it's not where it needs to be.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:51.680]   They need to be down the road being able to buy subscriptions to various personal assistants
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.080]   from Jarvis on down.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.760]   >> I can give you some examples of Passbook as another example where lots of promise.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.760]   Very little delivery.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.680]   And I'm not knocking Apple.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.440]   I just think that this is a tough thing to do in general.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   And Apple is -- Google's data-driven from day one.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.440]   Apple's a hardware company.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440]   >> Yeah.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   And it goes deep into the cultures.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:17.280]   I mean, Apple waits to release things until they're sort of ready at these stages instead
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.480]   of iterating constantly.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.600]   That actually holds you back in this kind of service model and software and services.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.120]   And I think, you know, Maps is probably not a bad analogy, actually.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.280]   A lot of acquisitions ahead of time.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.400]   A lot of work went into the data.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.560]   You know, the product had some problems, but frankly, it wasn't as horrible, I think,
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560]   as people said.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.040]   And now they're slowly, slowly improving it.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.280]   So if they've learned from that, I think that they have a shot in this other space.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.640]   But I do think Google will eat their lunch on it.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   >> And don't forget, too, that this is a hardware product that is going to rely -- Apple's
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.920]   not a hardware company.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.000]   It's a hardware and software together making products company.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   >> Okay, yes, let's stand corrected.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.760]   >> And this is a piece of hardware that is going to require software integration to
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.760]   succeed or fail.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.240]   And I think Apple is much better at that than they are little software add-ons to existing.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.840]   The iPhone is not going to succeed or fail based on a past book or Maps.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:16.280]   But this imaginary soon-to-come watch-like whatever, that software's got to work or that
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.760]   product is going to be worthless.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.040]   And I think Apple's actually very good at that.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.040]   >> They understand that.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.680]   >> And that may be why we haven't seen it yet, is because this is hard and they have
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.680]   to do it right.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.280]   They can't kind of do it halfway and hope that it's okay because this whole product will
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.080]   fail if they don't do the software right.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.240]   >> I think unlike a lot of people, I look at the prototypes for the watch, I imagine
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.920]   it will be beautiful.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.360]   I will buy one.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.720]   I think a lot of people buy one, but they better deliver or you're going to really have a
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720]   problem.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.040]   And the one advantage, now I'll step back and say the one advantage Apple has is nobody
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.040]   trusts Google.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.520]   Well, I don't know.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.520]   Do people trust Google?
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.520]   >> I don't know.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.520]   A lot of people don't.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.520]   Some do.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.520]   I mean, I think it's- >> I trust them.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.760]   But I mean, the norm will be trust Google.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   And for Google, had to shut down its health repository.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:02.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:03.760]   >> Well, yeah.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.760]   For uploading your own records.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:11.120]   >> So, Microsoft has a very, by the way, a very well developed health fault.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.320]   But Google doesn't.
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:16.080]   And I think people are a little bit nervous about Google.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.400]   And as Google wants to gather more information like critical stuff like health information,
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.880]   they might get more nervous indeed.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.840]   Whereas Apple, people trust Apple, yes?
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   Or no?
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.000]   >> Yeah, no, I think they do.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.240]   I think they do more than Google.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.640]   I think it also depends how ultimately you use this.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.600]   I think you're completely right.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:37.600]   Can Apple build some basic software on top of it that integrates with APIs to tell you
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.640]   what to eat or to go to sleep or to go to the doctor?
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.640]   Yes.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.320]   But what about when our health data changes our thermostat based on how we feel?
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.320]   And the bigger picture where it's integrating to so many different services.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.360]   That's where I'm running ahead.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:00.280]   But I think that that's where that competency and data and integrations could come back
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.280]   to Bight Apple.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.880]   I think for the beginning you can start very basic.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.640]   I do wonder though, I guess it depends on the price point, but can you really, really
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.280]   get mass market with something that tells you how well you slept?
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.280]   That's kind of the beauty of Apple.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.760]   They don't have to be that mass market.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.760]   That's true, sir.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.760]   This is going to be a fashion.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.760]   It's going to be aspirational and then it will come down.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   That's true.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.600]   I mean, we're talking about the differentiating features.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.880]   I mean, I've had a pebble that I've worn more or less for the last year.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.720]   I've had it for a year now.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:32.400]   And I mean, what I've learned in the last year is that the ability to glance at your
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:37.160]   wrist and see if that text that just came in is worth responding to or not.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:42.400]   Doing some very specific, simple triage, not doing phone things on it, but just doing
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.400]   some glances.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.400]   Well, what does that have value?
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.400]   You know what it is.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.080]   Is there ever a time when your phone isn't next to you when you have your watch?
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080]   Oh, it's a good guess.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   It's my pocket.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.080]   I'm lazy.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   Batter, fatter, fatter, fatter.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.880]   Like this is why you don't have to worry about Apple.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:58.160]   Apple can throw whatever horse crap it wants to with medical, whatever, sensors that taste
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.400]   your sweat and tell you if you have this much or that much or whatever.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.800]   It doesn't matter because as long as it works and doesn't overstep and has good battery
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:12.120]   life, people will discover the joys of not pulling your phone out every single time a
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.120]   message comes in.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.120]   It's gotta look good.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   That thing.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.320]   I have a couple of contact lenses.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.000]   Then we're not going to need any of this right.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.560]   So I mean, I want that.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.800]   I forget Google Glass because smartwatch, I want a heads up display everywhere.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.800]   I walk.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.080]   I want things popping up over your heads.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.000]   I don't want to see life at all.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   So good.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.640]   The problem with this is it's ugly.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.000]   And I think that that's the promise.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Come on.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   You think that's pretty?
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   I had a Casio calculator watch.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.720]   Yeah, you're the wrong guy to ask.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.880]   I don't think the pebble steel is a solution to the problem.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:44.880]   I don't know how big a problem.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.880]   It's easy to find the examples.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:49.680]   Oh, I was in a meeting and someone texted me and it was urgent and I could solve the
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.680]   problem.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.400]   You know, I just, I don't know how much.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.600]   And you know, my pebble is still sort of in a drawer.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.960]   So I should really.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.400]   That's so crazy because like I use the pebble.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.400]   What are you wearing?
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   I don't see a pebble.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.400]   Is that a pebble?
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.400]   Oh, there you go right there, bro.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.400]   Wow.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.400]   There's a pebble.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.040]   And in fact, like little things like like nowadays all come, I'll be on the other side
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.680]   of the house because I always leave my phone on silent now, which I don't have to have
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:19.400]   annoying loud, you know, exploding sound effects whenever someone calls now because
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.960]   I can be on the other side of the house and just look and be like, Oh, someone's calling
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.360]   me right now and I'll go run into the other room and then realize I'm not going to get
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.360]   to the phone in time.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.200]   And so I'll just hit answer when I'm still around the corner.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.120]   And I know I bought myself like five, 10 more seconds before I get there to pick up the
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.120]   phone.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.120]   But you can't talk to the pebble.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.680]   No, you can't actually answer the phone.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.320]   You have to go to your phone.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.080]   Yeah, you still have to get over there.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:46.400]   I'm telling you, man, structurally, you add up all those eight second moments.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   Yep.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.400]   There's so many of them every day.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.840]   I've probably saved just in the first few months.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:54.480]   I've saved hours, literal hours of this crap.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.120]   If you love, hold on.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.120]   It's there.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.120]   There it is.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.120]   If you love that moment, then don't get a pebble.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.800]   But if you want to know my advice, keep it in your breast pocket because it comes out
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.800]   much easier.
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.800]   Yeah, yeah, the breast pocket.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.800]   Let's get to my.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.800]   Here's what you don't have a vest.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.800]   Everybody should have a vest.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.400]   But lesson of pebble is that it doesn't try to do too much.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.600]   It just does a few things and it does it exquisitely well.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   You charge it once a week and that's it.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.000]   All right, I'm going to put mine on.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   You're going to put yours on?
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   I will put mine on.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   Yeah, we're going to.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   It's too far too against.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   We'll try it.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.840]   But I do think if Apple made something that was gorgeous, I'd be much more likely to
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.080]   wear it than this, which frankly doesn't look even the steel.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.040]   We just showed the steel doesn't look much better than that Casio.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.040]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.040]   I agree.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.040]   In fact, it may look more like that Casio.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.640]   But my point is that there are those table stakes that we often ignore when we're talking
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.080]   about these exciting health things.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.840]   There will probably be some very nice integration with your iPhones notifications and remote
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:59.920]   control and other things like that that may be also reasons I don't see how it would.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.920]   And I'll tell you what.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:05.760]   Here's the other thing is if Apple Smart, they will make it expensive as hell because
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.240]   they're moving into the fashion realm and you can be a 50.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.800]   No, $500.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.360]   I want it to be $600.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.840]   Like that's the thing is it needs to be a status symbol.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.040]   The mere fact that you have the money to spend on it.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   That's where they need the position.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040]   That's where they need the position.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.920]   They need to create a new category for the ultra high end smartwatch.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:28.520]   There'll be a sport version that'll be cheaper and then they'll have the elegant version.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.520]   The elegant.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:31.520]   Piancé version.
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.120]   It's the end of Swipe and Sign.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.440]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.160]   Go to meeting our sponsor today.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.160]   By the way, great panel.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.480]   Thank you for being here.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.800]   Mr. Brian Brushwood from NSFW Scamschool.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:48.920]   Don't forget his new National Geographic television show Hacking the System debuts February 27th.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   That's exciting.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.200]   Jessica Lesson from TheInformationTheInformation.com.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:58.520]   You must subscribe because it's a good thing.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.320]   Did that fap for you, Brian?
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.760]   It was good.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:07.600]   And of course, from IDG editorial director, that means he's in charge both of the MacSight
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:08.600]   and the Windows side.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.200]   So he knows what he's talking about.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.200]   Mr. Jason Snell.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.240]   We've even got an Android site now.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.240]   It's fancy.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240]   Really?
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.240]   And what's the site that you developed for them?
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.240]   I keep forgetting the tech hive.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.040]   I love tech hive.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.040]   Got to plug that more often.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.040]   I'm telling you.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.600]   But tech hive is really great.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.760]   And it's friendly.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.760]   It's fun.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   It's exciting.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:34.120]   Six Academy Award nominees to stream on Netflix must have mobile apps for Sochi Winter
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.120]   Games.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.440]   We may be one of the few websites to have a movie, a real movie critic writing about
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.280]   what's streamable on Netflix.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.280]   I'm excited.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.280]   Yes.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:46.280]   Jeffrey Anderson who writes for the San Francisco Examiner and I went to high school with.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.880]   And he writes now streaming for us.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.360]   That is fantastic.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:54.960]   Netflix have alerts where you can find out if a show becomes available.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.960]   There's a great site.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960]   What is it?
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.320]   Is it like Netflix watcher or something?
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:02.760]   Chatham will tell us that you can actually get notifications and it will beep you and
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:06.800]   it will email you and when things are going to expire or when it's leaving.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.360]   This is exactly what we need.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.360]   Innovation.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.880]   Chatham, it's not can I stream it?
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.640]   Although that's a great site as well.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.960]   Is it Insta watcher?
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.800]   Insta watcher.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:22.760]   We will check into that while I talk to you about go to meeting from Citrix.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.800]   The weather outside is frightful on the East Coast Atlanta.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.200]   Once again, if you live in Atlanta, get go to meeting.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.760]   Once again, gridlock is coming.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.360]   There's a storm up north.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.360]   We got rain here.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.200]   We got flash flood alerts.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.200]   This is a terrible time to try to do business.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.400]   But go to meeting solves that.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.800]   Go to meeting means you can meet.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.880]   You can collaborate online no matter what the weather is like outside.
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.200]   In fact, frankly, I wish the weather bad all the time.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.200]   I could stay home.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.200]   I could do go to meeting.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.520]   I know teams that keep go to meeting running all the time.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.240]   You could see share screens.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.760]   So you see what people are working on.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.360]   And by the way, you could pass the screen around.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.320]   So everybody in the meeting can show their screen.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.680]   Great for coding together, that kind of thing.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.160]   If you turn on the video cameras and everything these days have video cameras, you can see
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.960]   each other in crystal clear, high def video.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.800]   So when you can't make it to the office, you can still meet.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800]   You can be productive.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.920]   Go to meeting is awesome.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:19.080]   You can even host a meeting present from an iPad.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.080]   I love it.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.400]   Works on all the mobile devices.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   Go to meeting.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.840]   I want you to try it for 30 days.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.560]   Visit go to meeting.com.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.800]   Check the green-- no, I guess not green anymore.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.800]   What color is it?
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.640]   The orange, try it free button, whatever.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.040]   The one that says try it free.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:37.720]   Use the promo code TWIT TWIT and you got 30 days absolutely free.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.880]   Go to meeting.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.520]   We use it for meetings here.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.600]   In fact, even when we just want to do a teleconference because you get a phone bridge, we always
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.200]   use go to meeting just because then you also have the chance to share the screen if you
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.080]   want or to another video, if you want that kind of thing.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.920]   Instant watch, that's not it.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.920]   Yeah, I think that is it.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.960]   Unfortunately, Netflix has actually made their API worse lately and now you can't get the
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   expiration date.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.240]   That would be a feature that I would think Netflix would want.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.240]   You know, the movie companies may not want Netflix.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.560]   It does highlight the weakness is that stuff is only temporarily available.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.680]   I can understand why Netflix wouldn't want that.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:15.160]   And they claim that when they shut down that API, I was just looking at it.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.760]   It sounds like it's not always accurate because they're apparently doing last minute negotiations
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.760]   to bring things back.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.760]   Oh, I see.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.760]   I see.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:23.760]   It will look like it's timing off and then it won't.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.760]   OK, that makes sense.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.760]   But that would be good to have more info about what's coming and what's coming in the place.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.480]   Which Netflix, how's the cards, right?
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.480]   Oh, I can't wait.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.480]   Oh my gosh.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.960]   How's the card season three is already apparently in the world?
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.960]   They got approval.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:43.160]   So Dana Brunetti told me that we would have Kevin Spacey on as soon as season two was
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.160]   ready.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160]   So I'll let you know.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.160]   Awesome.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.160]   Kevin's an old friend.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.400]   You know, Kevin's a geek.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.160]   We had him on the screen savers a couple of times.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160]   He's an old friend.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.160]   I do remember that.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.200]   And the drum saying that people want to be able to cut the chord.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.080]   You saw that incredible video he did at the YouTube conference in Ireland.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.920]   Yeah, that was a great speech.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:03.920]   Inspirational.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.680]   See, if you haven't seen that, go watch it.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.000]   It's incredible.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.400]   So finally, finally in the United States where we have been saddled with the old-fashioned
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.840]   credit card for far too long, I think after the target breach, finally MasterCard and Visa
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.000]   said, all right, we've had it.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   It's over.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   We're going to do it.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.400]   Ship and Pin is coming October 2015.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.000]   All the major credit cards will do it.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.800]   See in Europe who deals with American travelers is breathing a sigh of relief because you're
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.800]   trying to buy something.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:30.800]   Now, what is that?
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:34.080]   Pretend I'm actually not a tech host and explain to me.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.080]   All right.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.320]   So look at this box on the Wall Street Journal's page about this.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.120]   This is what when you go to a restaurant in Europe, in Russia or even Canada, yeah,
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:46.920]   or anywhere, really, except the United States where we still use proudly the imperial system
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.280]   for feet and miles.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.200]   You give your credit card to somebody and they take it away and you don't know where
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   it's going.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   And then they bring you back.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.360]   Ten minutes later, you get a bill.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.760]   But and who else knows else?
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.760]   What else you got?
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.760]   You probably get crabs too.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.920]   So this is, no, I had a seafood restaurant.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.120]   Seafood restaurant only.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.120]   This is what you get in Europe.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.120]   You'll get a little box.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.120]   The waiter comes to you.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.120]   He swipes your card.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.120]   You enter your pin number.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.120]   You pay that way.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.120]   You know what you paid.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:14.320]   You may or may not have to sign you, but the pin is sufficient.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.680]   The idea is now, I don't know why we never adopted this.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.560]   Some people said that Americans think it's too complicated.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.160]   It's a pain in the ass.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.160]   Very diplomatic.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160]   No, it's not.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.160]   Mastercard, very diplomatic.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.880]   You have zero liability.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.880]   You could get, I could give out my credit card number right now and you and we'll run
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.200]   it up and I have no obligation to pay anything that is done with that.
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.080]   There's no liability.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:44.000]   So okay, so over Christmas target, first it was 40 million credit cards breach, then
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.280]   it was 70 million credit cards.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.120]   And then they said, well, actually it's probably more like a hundred million credit
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:53.440]   cards, including pin numbers and target ATM cards and all that breached.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.840]   I think that was probably the last straw.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:59.080]   I imagine these credit card companies had to issue millions of new cards to people.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.720]   And finally just said, so now you stick this thing into the slot.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.400]   It reads the little chip on the car.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.640]   There's a microchip in the car.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.880]   And then you put in your pin and that's what unlocks it and knowing the, knowing the credit
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.480]   card number won't get you anywhere.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:12.480]   They have to match.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.040]   Now, of course, you could make a card with a chip in it.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.760]   You could duplicate it, but it's a lot harder, more expensive.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:23.320]   The chip has to be, it's probably encrypted.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:29.440]   I think it's a little bit more Trixie, although never count a hacker out and I wouldn't be
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:30.720]   surprised if they figured this out.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.800]   Look, I understand the benefit to Visa and MasterCard.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.280]   Of course, they're going to want to do this.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.280]   I'd like to you.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.240]   There'd also be biometrics in there, sure.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.840]   But what's the benefit to us, the consumer?
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:41.960]   Why is that so great?
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.640]   That doesn't sound like a fun, easy experience.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.560]   I don't want to have to, you know, be in the middle of a discussion over dinner, like,
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.040]   excuse me, let me secret code over.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.280]   Oh, come on, Brian.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.280]   That's not hard.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.520]   What are you talking about?
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520]   Do I get mad?
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.520]   I still get mad that I put my tip.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.040]   Do you sign the check or you say, take my money?
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040]   I don't care.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.760]   Do you figure out the tip?
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.760]   That's too hard.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760]   Don't make me figure out the tip.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.800]   You're going to do a guy who just was singing the praises of the eight seconds every hour.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.800]   I know, but seriously, it's easy.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:16.800]   I've done it.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:16.800]   I don't think it's any less than putting your card in the little thing and then having it
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.160]   on the edge of the table for the guy to come and take away.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.160]   It's not hard.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.920]   They come with a little thing in you.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:27.920]   It's a different thing culturally, but I think the benefit is that if somebody tries
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.880]   to steal your credit card number, you don't have to like change your number and change
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.720]   all your auto-pays on all your accounts.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:36.960]   Sure, you're not liable, but it's still a big pain in the ass.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.320]   Have you ever had your credit card stolen, Brian?
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.960]   I lose my credit card all the time.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.640]   Then I'm like, give me another credit card.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.480]   But then I just memorize the number and then whatever it's fine.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.840]   The other problem that is maybe you haven't had, but I have all the time, is we get our
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:55.200]   credit cards turned off all the time because we do something that the bank deems scary.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.960]   Including traveling.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.960]   Including buying gas and sneakers.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.280]   I'll all normal things.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.600]   So it'll be much nicer to have something more secure.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.600]   I hope it's...
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.000]   So Brian is the reason we don't have it yet.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   It's your...
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   I now understand.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000]   I could never understand why we didn't have it.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   You know what?
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   Actually, you bring up a good point.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.360]   If going chip and pin is a minor inconvenience every single time I use it, but it saves me
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:23.040]   from the major inconvenience of them shutting off my credit card because they have...
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.000]   They see something they don't understand.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.960]   Then I might be on board with that, but I don't know.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:27.960]   Just structurally.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.920]   Again, I understand why they want it.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.680]   I'm just surprised you guys want it.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.680]   That's what's weird to me.
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.680]   Well, as...
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:34.680]   I want no credit cards.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.680]   I mean...
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:39.280]   I thought you were finally getting rid of this card that...
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.840]   You know, it was going to be phones and other things.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:48.400]   That would be nice, but traveling outside the US right now is really scary because...
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.840]   You can't buy gas.
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.280]   You can't buy gas because you have a swipe card.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   They won't take it.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:58.040]   Right, so some places only do chip and pin and other places, they can do American style
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:02.920]   transactions, but the people in the stores aren't trained on how to do it.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:07.840]   I had to show them the slot at one place in London where they're like, "Oh, that's what
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.840]   the slot is for."
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:09.840]   Yeah, you slide the card.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.840]   Oh, we've got that slot for years.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.640]   We never knew what it was for.
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:17.840]   There was a small family of birds nesting in it.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.680]   And so for international travelers, this would be great because our cards will be equipped
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.840]   to use that system and they won't look at us like we're crazy people.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.840]   But you're right.
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:27.840]   You're right.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.800]   I can't tell you how many times I've left my wallet at home but had my smartphone in
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.320]   my pocket and realized I should be able to pay for something with this and I can't do
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.320]   it.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.800]   Well, there's tapping pay more and more you can, but it's not widespread.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.800]   Yeah, and I'm just wearing stuff.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:40.800]   Yeah, but it's not a top.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:45.800]   NSC, which means that that's not going to be the solution because there's a million.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.960]   No, it's all Bluetooth, Ellie, and Ibeken and all that stuff.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:53.880]   In fact, what my solution would be now would be I would load up my Starbucks card and then
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:58.840]   have Starbucks scan my phone and buy a sandwich at Starbucks.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.800]   I think would be how I would do it if I didn't know what I would do.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.480]   That's why I forgot my wallet and spend a day eating out of Starbucks that way.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.480]   That's easy.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.040]   Yeah, but it should be easier.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.440]   Save that for your life hack and show there, Brian.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.440]   There you go.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.440]   I like it.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.920]   That's a good little tip.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:16.360]   How does survive by living on Starbucks?
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.600]   Speaking of Bitcoin, Mt.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:23.280]   Gox has announced they're not going to allow you to trade in bitcoins for cash for a while.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.960]   Is this the beginning of the end for Bitcoin?
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.120]   Russia says no Bitcoin.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:27.520]   China says no Bitcoin.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.520]   Actually, it's more complicated than that.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.720]   You're going to have a Bitcoin in China.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.560]   You just can't use it.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.720]   I mean, does it matter?
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.720]   It's the government's?
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.720]   I mean, in that.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.720]   And I'll tell you why.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.640]   It's just because you don't need the government's permission.
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:44.800]   Well, it matters because a lot of the value of Bitcoin at this point is speculation, right?
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.520]   So Bitcoin, for instance, is now down to $676.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:54.240]   It lost about 50% of its value because of these couple of data points.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.120]   Do Mt. Gox give a reason?
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.280]   It's pretty suspicious.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.840]   I mean, there are some questions about liquidity and all that stuff.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.040]   I mean, look, if I'm...
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.360]   Okay, let's go back to John C. de Vorak.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.200]   Put on our John C. de Vorak's hat here.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:09.840]   If I'm a government, damn right, I don't want cryptocurrencies out there.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.600]   Damn right, I'm going to say we won't accept it.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.600]   We won't trade it.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.600]   We don't want it.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.600]   We don't like it.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   I understand why the government's lying on it.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.600]   You shouldn't like it either.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.680]   Especially oppressive governments that really want to monitor every single thing that happens.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:23.440]   Yes, if you have a centralized government having a second currency system that's out of your
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.440]   control is not desirable.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.440]   It's your worst.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.760]   On the other hand, it is probably very prevalent.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.920]   I'm sure Barner and other sort of systems occur in the more repressive the government,
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:34.280]   the more likely you've got that, right?
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.280]   And using other currencies.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:36.280]   Yeah, contract.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.280]   And the...
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.280]   So here's the Mowgok statement.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.320]   You parse this, Jessica.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:44.160]   In our efforts to resolve the issue being encountered by various Bitcoin withdrawals,
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.160]   it was determined.
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.160]   That's always a sign, by the way.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.160]   It was passive voice.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.160]   It was determined.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.160]   It was determined.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.760]   It was determined that the increase in the flow of withdrawal requests has hindered our
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:57.360]   efforts on a technical level to understand the issue thoroughly the system needs to be
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.360]   in a static state.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:03.560]   So a temporary pause on withdrawal requests.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.040]   Yeah, that's so much nonsense.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:11.560]   Because that's the forex exchanges are all based on the ability to have a dynamic marketplace
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:16.760]   where people speculate in some win and some lose and some form of equilibrium is created
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.960]   as a result.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:21.360]   And it's like, I don't know, who cares if the government's disapproved?
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.480]   The more the government's disapprove of Bitcoin, the more legitimate I think the platform sounds
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.480]   to me.
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.080]   Well, the interesting thing about this though is it, so we did a story a while ago about
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.520]   what a Bitcoin bank run would look like.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:37.400]   Just from the sense of how much liquidity is there in the system and you have all these
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:42.280]   different marketplaces for buying and selling, but a lot of those businesses are making money
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:48.880]   by themselves trading Bitcoin, which means they may not have cash or Bitcoin or anything
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:49.880]   to pay out.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:55.720]   And so this, which I actually just heard about, raises a lot of alarm bells in my head about
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:58.680]   whether Mount Gox is in liquidity issues.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.000]   And that is a big concern.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.160]   And we have to remember, this isn't the first time, I mean, Bitcoin's been around for a
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.560]   long time and there have been issues like this in the past.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.680]   So separate from what happens in terms of regulation or whether it gets adopted as a
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:16.480]   payment mechanism, the sort of stability of the current system is I think in question
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.480]   now because of this.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.480]   And that's more problematic.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.480]   Perception is very important.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.880]   Perception in something like this is very important.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:25.280]   And you have this on top of the Silk Road and Ross Ulbrecht.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:31.480]   This arrest now of Charlie Schrem for money laundering using Bitcoin.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:32.480]   All of these-
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.480]   We ran the Bitcoin Foundation, I believe.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.720]   Of course, it happened with real money.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.080]   That's normal.
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.720]   But the problem is at this point, perception is very important in terms of the value of
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:42.720]   Bitcoin.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.440]   You see it's dropping in value.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.600]   So I don't know.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:51.120]   I've always wondered if Bitcoin is just a pyramid scheme to benefit Satoshi Nakamoto
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.560]   and the others who created Bitcoin, who presumably have mass amounts.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.680]   Well, you know, currency is a consensual hallucination.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.680]   Like even cash.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.680]   It's major.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.640]   I'm giving paper to you and you were giving me hard goods.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:03.640]   It's crazy.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:11.520]   But with like US currency or Euro or any government currency, we sort of have this expectation
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:14.680]   that that hallucination will continue for a long period of time unless there's a zombie
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.680]   apocalypse or something like that.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:21.280]   Bitcoin, I still am in that state of I'm not sure whether the fever will break and this
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:25.160]   hallucination will end and that's the scary thing for me about it.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.240]   But it's like, I mean, that's fine.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.640]   I mean, from my perspective, like we started accepting bitcoins on scam stuff and it was
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.760]   great because we had people who had a bunch of bitcoins who wanted to buy our stuff at
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:36.760]   scamstuff.com.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.240]   Shopify had an app.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.400]   It took about 20 minutes to install it.
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.960]   And now, you know, the moment it goes, whatever the current exchange rate is, I get real
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:44.960]   money.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.360]   Like, I don't think it says dramatic a decision as you guys are making it out to be.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.480]   I think it's a bunch of little guys like me saying like, yeah, sure, that's a type of
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.480]   money.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:55.480]   Sure.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.480]   Go.
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.480]   But you get the bitcoins or is somebody converting those bitcoins?
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.480]   You can choose.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.880]   You could choose to either deposit it into your own Bitcoin wallet, which I don't.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.800]   I just translated it at whatever market rates is.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:09.200]   It's the same as if someone wants to spend euros or British pounds or whatever.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.280]   I don't have a problem with that.
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.480]   I'm worried about if I'm holding bitcoins when the music stops.
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.480]   Yes.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:15.480]   Okay, then don't hold them.
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.240]   Then I don't get it.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.440]   Just get them and spend them.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:22.080]   And it's still there's, there's still a really good purpose for them, I think.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.320]   And as far as like, like, well, I just think that the people who got in early want to get
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.160]   rich, hell yes, that's why, that's why they desire that why they built this platform.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.840]   That's the reason you build a platform that you hope the whole world will like is so that
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.520]   you could get rich making it.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:40.760]   And the best way to do that is to make a really good platform that a lot of people like it.
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.160]   And in this case, you know, current like real money.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.040]   I'm using air quotes here is inherently inflationary and fed just prints dollars or whatever.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.840]   That's not a great system that I would build from the beginning.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:51.840]   And in this, at least.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:52.840]   Actually, that's a lot.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.840]   Now you now you're getting into areas of economic theory that are fairly obstrues and
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:58.840]   complicated.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:37:59.840]   Sure.
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:03.480]   Well, the way old areas in fact, a real value to being able to print money and the.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480]   Sure.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480]   Especially if you want the.
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.960]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:08.960]   very important.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.480]   That'll be this topic of this week's.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:11.480]   You cannot get out of recession.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.720]   You cannot get out of recession unless you can do that.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720]   But this is my point.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.200]   This is my point is at least somebody's trying something different.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.200]   Not the marketplace of ideas.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.200]   Hash it out.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.080]   We had a bunch of people with personal interest.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:24.200]   Yeah, I don't think the US government is going to say, oh, no more Bitcoin.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.720]   I don't think that's going to be an issue.
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:26.720]   It will.
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:32.800]   I, the only issue would be people who, you know, take like you maybe take Bitcoin and
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:34.920]   then keep it and then lose their shirt.
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.160]   As you say, be the beholding Bitcoin when the music stops.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.160]   That would be.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.360]   Yeah, I love it as an idea.
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:45.920]   I just as a long as an investment, it seems awfully insecure.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:46.920]   That's that's all.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.200]   By the way, I love the idea.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.320]   I'm holding my bitcoins because I believe like the Winklevoss twins that they're going
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.520]   to reach $40,000 a coin.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.520]   All right.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.520]   And I am going to be rich.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:57.520]   How many coins?
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.520]   Seven.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:38:59.520]   Wow.
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.520]   You guys are crazy.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.720]   You guys need to be in Dogecoin.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.560]   That's where the app that is.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.560]   We actually, we actually, Twitter is really into the Dogecoin.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.360]   I believe we have a Dogecoin miner in the basement or two.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360]   Do we, Chad?
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.360]   Father, we have.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.200]   Father, we have, we have, okay.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.240]   Let's talk about the nexus of weird stuff.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.280]   Our resident Jesuit priest has been teaching everyone else how to mine Dogecoin.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.080]   Okay, I ask you, conspiracy much?
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.760]   I believe, I believe the current count of the whole brick house with everyone's Doge is
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.760]   somewhere in the 2 million to 3 million Dogecoins.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.560]   And you know, the Doge is where the, what, Bishops of Venice, which is in Italy, which
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.040]   is where the Vatican is.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.520]   I rest my case.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:41.920]   I'm just saying conspiracy.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.920]   He keeps going.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:47.080]   Pay no attention to that Dogecoin in the basement.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:50.280]   When the next pope is one of those dogs, we'll know the jig is on.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.760]   Are you guys seeing the Dogeweather.com?
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.760]   No.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:40:01.480]   It's a, it's, if you go to doge, E-A-T-H-E-R dot com, it, it basically goes to Dogeberson.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.480]   Wow.
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:04.480]   Light rain.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:05.480]   Wow.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480]   Such moisture.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480]   Such might as.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.480]   So moderate.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.480]   So moderate.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.480]   Wow.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.480]   That's cute.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.560]   That's probably better than the dark skies, actually.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560]   That's, that's lovely.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.240]   You don't need all that detail.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.240]   You just need a Doge.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.080]   I don't get this meme, by the way.
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.280]   I just want you to know.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.280]   I don't.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.960]   It's just, it's just expressing the gestalt of idiot.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.280]   I don't understand the internet.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.440]   I, you know, one thing I'm going to tell you right now, because I'm the oldest guy here
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:37.440]   by, by probably a launch shot.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.920]   Used to be when you'd get old, the music could get louder.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.040]   Because, you know, their hairstyles would change.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.800]   You just kind of would mildly not approve and not understand it.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.760]   And then you would fade away.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.840]   I can see already this is happening to me.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.600]   It is going to happen like a landslide from now on.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:57.440]   When you guys get old, it's going to be, I don't understand anything at all.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.160]   It's all Dogecoin all the way down.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:00.160]   I'm telling you.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.160]   That's a singularity, Leo.
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.520]   The singularity doesn't happen at once for the whole society.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.520]   It happens in an age brain.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:07.600]   It's like a turn 45 and you're like, I have no idea what's going on anymore.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.400]   It's terrible.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:14.000]   So Jessica, you said now this is interesting.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.760]   So Secret, which is another app that's taken the World by Storm.
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.320]   This isn't the first of these.
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.880]   Whisper came out earlier.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.120]   This is a direct copy with one exception.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.800]   The idea of Secret is you share stuff.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:31.440]   It's on your, it's like Twitter, but anonymous and you share stuff.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:35.000]   But the difference and the reason I think it's so successful is unlike Whisper, which
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.360]   was totally anonymous, you can tell if the people who are sharing are in your address
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:43.240]   book or friends of people in your address book.
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:47.600]   And so the part of the fun of this is looking at it and going, who could that be?
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.920]   I don't know about you though.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.840]   I got a lot of people in my address book.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:51.960]   I do too.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.320]   And so it feels like that little friend circle of friend thing isn't that telling.
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:00.120]   Although it does set off the game in your head of a...
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:01.760]   There was a secret about Flappy Bird.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:02.760]   That was really exciting.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.160]   Flappy Bird was by far the worst game I've ever played.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.160]   Now you can heart it and then it will go to more friends of friends.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:12.880]   Okay, here's the other thing is people are just like with Twitter and everything else,
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.520]   not really sharing their deepest heartfelt secrets.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.520]   They're trying to be clever.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:17.520]   They're trying to be clever.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.800]   And if you're trying to be clever, you usually want credit for being clever, which is why
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.800]   you then see people screenshotting and posting their secret to brag about the secret.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.040]   So that's kind of a disconnect.
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.480]   This is my favorite troll that I've seen on Secret was somebody put this out.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:38.800]   It says, "From a friend, this is a fake sponsored tweet that everyone just goes, 'You're
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.800]   not getting all mad.'"
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:42.520]   And you're like, "Whoa, is this a joke or whatever?"
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:45.600]   I can't believe Ford is spying sponsored secrets.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:52.800]   And then it says, "The best is the response is, 'Test Drive a Ford Fusion,' and you'll
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.000]   see, 'It's no joke.'"
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000]   That's brilliant.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.360]   I'm going to do that to my circle of friends.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.240]   So this is somebody in my address book saying, "Everybody has to stop using secret because
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.640]   I have a minor philosophical quibble with it."
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.840]   And so I think that's kind of fun because you're trying to think, "Well, but you're right,
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.800]   I have like a thousand people in there."
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.160]   So are journalists, and then you just see things like...
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:18.480]   So the funny thing that happened this week is, well, someone, there was a secret posted
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.240]   saying, "I work at Evernote and we're about to get acquired."
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.240]   Right.
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.120]   And so then, of course, the fabulous cohorts of tech journalists think, "Oh, holy shit,
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.400]   if there's even a shred of truth to this, I can't get in trouble."
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:34.760]   So everyone calls Evernote and all their Evernote sources and says, "And so Phil Lippen, the
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.840]   CEO of Evernote tweeted, 'There's no truth to this.'"
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.000]   But the Wall Street Journal covered it.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:47.680]   This is what distracted a bunch of tech reporters, which tiny plug for why the information is
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.680]   awesome.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:51.640]   That's a brilliant use of secrets.
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.440]   So I'm sitting there thinking, "This is great.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.760]   I'm working on these six stories right now if I just post a secret the opposite of these
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:01.800]   six stories, then everyone's going to have to spend their time tracing them."
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:04.200]   But it's so early.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.120]   It's really hard to see how that will play out.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:11.320]   But there's this, I mean, when you have a bunch of tech people using this, right?
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:16.200]   I mean, you're going to see a lot of this and there may be some shreds of truth to it.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:23.280]   From what I can tell, it's a lot of, there's, I have the techie strands and making fun of
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.120]   Valley WAG and so forth.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.040]   But for James Morin at Path, somehow has become the butt of massive amounts.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.920]   But now there's been a reaction to this.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.960]   And that was out of positive secrets.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.520]   You and I probably have similar friends.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.360]   I think we do.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.640]   And you know what, if we found out who these people were, it was probably like three of
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:43.440]   the people or probably friends.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.440]   Right.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:49.240]   But, you know, there's a lot of self-hopey kind of stuff.
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:51.240]   You know, people talking about their moods.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:52.240]   All right, B.U.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.440]   Flappy Bird, you, our grandchildren will hear stories of your brilliance, but will never
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.160]   be able to experience it.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.640]   But something like that, like that's clever and the person should want, you know, they're
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:04.480]   probably, why not put that in the public world?
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:06.800]   Because there's a million people putting that on Twitter, right?
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.880]   Yeah, so we'll see.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.000]   I like the team behind Secret, actually.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.520]   I think the guys are great.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.760]   Former Google guys worked at Square.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.160]   Very nice engineers.
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.120]   The app, actually, for something that's kind of not intuitive to use, I think they did
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:24.160]   a really cool job of sort of educating you how it works.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:27.160]   I just, not sure what this is involved in too.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.800]   But, actually, your friends are really boring.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:32.080]   Why is there more sex, love, and rock and roll sex and drugs?
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:35.080]   I prefer leftovers, particularly when cold.
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:38.480]   I guess the secrets of my friends are just not good.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:41.320]   Well, the secrets of most people probably aren't that good.
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:42.320]   And, you know, so I think-
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.840]   Oh, my God, look what somebody's just posted.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.320]   I work at Twitch and we're about to be acquired.
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.320]   Oh, my God, I-
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.120]   The information is gonna require Twitch.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.680]   I'm afraid that that's true.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:52.680]   Okay.
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:57.120]   You know, the other thing they did is you could put your own pictures behind here.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.120]   That makes it kind of a little more-
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.120]   It's great.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.120]   The app itself is really nice to use.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:05.120]   I mean, apps are getting great in terms of design and features and-
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120]   Monoxidil.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120]   It's not working.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.120]   It also does notifications, which makes it particularly-
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.120]   Oh, and they're like your friend has shared a secret.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.120]   You know, I mean, it's the most- Smart.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.120]   Ticing notifications.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.120]   So, Whisper did all of the- did the same basic thing, but didn't take off and secret
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:24.120]   did because of little things like that.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:25.120]   Well, I also did.
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:29.720]   Sorry, this week, you have basically ValleyWag posted a stream of secrets too.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:30.720]   And so, you know, it's getting-
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:31.720]   Right.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:34.480]   Some- it's the Echo Chamber talking to the Echo Chamber.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.120]   So, we'll see.
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.360]   Alexa Sohanian with clean shaven hot.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.200]   Alexa Sohanian with beard will-wheat.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.200]   All right.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:43.200]   Anyway.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.200]   Enough of that.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:46.200]   Enough of that.
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:49.200]   I'm glad we're getting acquired though.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.200]   Would whoever po-
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.760]   Did Chad- you posted that, didn't you?
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.760]   Chad Johnson, why I gotta-
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:02.840]   I did- I did make sure to like the only post I've done on secret was I said- I confessed
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:07.200]   that for a year I kept it secret that I was working on a show called Hacking the System.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.200]   Coming out on that geo.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.200]   This is-
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.200]   Sponsored.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.200]   Sponsored tweet.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.840]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:18.920]   If you are going to the post office, stop the insanity.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:21.200]   The post office is filled with amateurs.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:26.600]   If you are sending stuff out as your business, does he work at the post office?
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.840]   Is that why you padded his leg after I said that?
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.520]   I'm so sorry, sir.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.520]   But it's true.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:36.480]   I love the post office, but if you want to mail out bills or flyers or promotional material,
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.680]   if you say- you know, you work at Etsy.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:45.120]   You make this beautiful hand, macrame-ed golf club cover and you sell it.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.640]   You don't want to take it to the post office and give it to them.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.240]   You want to be able to ship it without getting up from your desk.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.240]   That's what Stamps.com does.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:55.960]   It turns you into a fulfillment house, professional postage rates change.
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:56.960]   They just change again.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:57.960]   You don't have to worry.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:01.960]   Unlike, say, in a postage meter, you don't have to pay to get the postage rates update.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:03.720]   You don't have to bring into the post office.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.720]   It just happens on a Mac.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.040]   It's software.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:09.320]   So you'll lose all those time-consuming trips to the post office.
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.280]   You can buy and print official US postage.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.280]   You can print stamps.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.280]   I do.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.880]   But you can also print right on the envelope with your logo, the return address.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.600]   You'll pull the address of the person you're mailing to from your address book or from
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:26.240]   QuickBooks or from the Etsy site or PayPal or Amazon or eBay and on and on and on.
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:30.000]   If it's international, it fills out the forms for all the international mailing.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.320]   The post office actually comes to you and picks it up.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.040]   There's this thing called the mail carrier.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.040]   It's incredible.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.040]   They come.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.040]   They have a leather bag.
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:38.040]   They put your thing in and they carry it off.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:43.200]   In fact, there's even a button on Stamps.com where if you've missed the pickup, says, "Come
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.720]   back," and they'll come back.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.520]   So you're going to love it.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:51.160]   I'm being a little silly, but really I do use it and love it.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.160]   It's just fabulous for our little business.
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:54.560]   You know what I found out?
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:57.400]   You use it for your store, right?
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.640]   Yeah, well, for a dude, it saved the day.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:06.560]   When we first launched Scam Stuff, we did like an Indiegogo campaign and did like $30,000
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.560]   of presales.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.480]   Then all of a sudden, I realized I needed to solve a lot of logistics problems all at
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.480]   once.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:13.480]   We went with Stamps.com.
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.080]   We used promo code TWIT and it totally saved the day for us.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.080]   But you know what I found out?
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:22.280]   After a year, I used to worry about printing out your metered postage.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.480]   It has you put the day that you're going to send it out on here.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:26.360]   You have to send it that day.
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:31.720]   I didn't realize that if you're a day late, they still take it almost always.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.400]   Me neither, apparently.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.400]   We see it.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:40.400]   But apparently, I was reprinting all of these and doing everything over, canceling and
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:45.240]   then redoing or whatever.
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:55.000]   So if you buy on scamstuff.com, a little plug for Brian sponsored, you will be getting
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000]   -- you'll see.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.800]   In fact, when it comes to you, you can see what it looks like.
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:58.800]   It really looks nice.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.800]   Very professional looking.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:00.800]   I want you to try it.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:01.800]   We have a no risk trial offer.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:04.760]   Normally, if you go to Stamps.com, it's $80.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.920]   This is a better one.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:06.920]   Go to Stamps.com.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:09.720]   Click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner there.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.720]   You can get it right there.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:13.640]   And use our offer code TWIT.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:16.040]   You'll get a $110 bonus offer.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.040]   It's $55 in free postage.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:21.960]   You get that USB scale so you always know exactly what the right postage is.
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:25.080]   You get a supply kit and of course a free month of Stamps.com.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.080]   Stamps.com.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.240]   Click the microphone.
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:32.000]   Use "Twit" as the offer code.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.240]   So Scamstuff still going on great guns for you, huh?
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.240]   That's great.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:42.880]   Well, I'll tell you what, Dan Carlin, who does the hardcore history podcast, talks about
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:47.260]   how there's really like in this new media space, there's like different legs to the
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:48.600]   stool to keep everything afloat.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:49.600]   Right.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.080]   And if you're a small independent broadcaster, maybe one is you have an Amazon affiliate
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:58.000]   code or another one is you accept direct donations or maybe you sell your back catalog of content
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.560]   or maybe you have a small online store.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:01.880]   And it's amazing.
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:07.280]   If you don't mind taking responsibility to do a whole bunch of little things, I mean,
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:12.520]   we're a three man operation and so far we're able to keep the lights on just by having
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:13.800]   all those little legs to the stool.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.640]   I have to say, I think that's always been the case.
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:18.080]   I think about my friends who are photographers.
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:21.840]   Very hard to make a living as a photographer, but if you teach, if you do books, it's always
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:28.840]   been the case that if you can, it's a kind of small time trans media have multiple different
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:30.280]   things that you're doing.
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:31.280]   Sure.
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:33.160]   It's a great idea.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:34.880]   You use Patreon too, right?
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:39.080]   We use Patreon for over at court killers.
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:45.200]   That's a direct subscription model thing where it's like, and it's interesting because
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:46.720]   somebody will make a decision.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.440]   And if you're a content producer, I love what they're doing at Patreon because somebody
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:52.920]   can pledge, let's say, a dollar an episode.
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:54.480]   So it's four bucks a month.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:58.680]   Like once you get on their credit card at four dollars a month, they have to make an
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:05.160]   active decision to unsubscribe from your show, which means like somebody to acquire a patron
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:09.720]   on patreon.com is much, much more valuable than getting a big payout from a Kickstarter
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:12.040]   campaign early on because that money runs out.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.040]   It's ongoing.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.880]   This is an ongoing pledge and a subscription.
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:16.280]   Very interesting idea.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:17.680]   It's for businesses.
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.560]   But this is, is it just for podcasts or the, it says be a patron of the arts?
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:23.560]   It's just for anything.
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:28.200]   Like, for example, you see like there's, there's YouTube videos, there's comic books,
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:32.600]   there's, there's right there in the upper right, she's doing like investigative journalism.
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:34.320]   Oh, she loved that.
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:37.280]   Johnson with the morning stream is on that list.
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:39.280]   A lot of our friends Tom does that.
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:40.280]   You do that.
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:41.280]   I know with court killers.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:43.280]   I know the Geekbeat TV.
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:44.280]   There's Callie Lewis on there.
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:45.280]   It's a lot of familiar faces.
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:49.000]   And I think, I think this is a good structure that's showing up in here.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000]   The only thing, the only thing I don't like about it is-
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.760]   Wow, 5,000 per episode.
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.160]   Well, that's per month.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:58.040]   So this is the only, this is the only thing that's frustrating is it gives a false sense
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:59.400]   of success sometimes.
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:05.120]   For example, like, let's say, let's say that that was $1,000 per episode and it would say
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.680]   they're making $1,000 per episode.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:09.480]   And then everybody who's a fan of the show thinks like, well, I don't need to help.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.280]   They're making $1,000 per episode.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:17.240]   You can, the, the, the, the pledges per episode can be inconsistent with the max pledges that
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:18.240]   people give.
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:23.880]   So for example, people can pledge $10 per episode and then set a max of $10 per month.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:26.320]   So, so your first episode, you get $1,000.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.400]   Next episode, you get $800.
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.800]   Next episode, you get $400.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:31.000]   Next episode and so on.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.520]   So, but they're, but they're aware of that problem and they're figuring out a way to
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.320]   make it a little more transparent.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:39.880]   But I think, I think it's a great, it's a great way for independence to, to get their
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.880]   stuff out.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.040]   I think it's, I think it's absolutely.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:46.240]   And I think that, I mean, of course we're obviously free ad supported media, which is
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.560]   a model I like.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:51.160]   Jessica's a paywall, which is another model that works for the right kind of content.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.160]   We couldn't do that.
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.160]   Nobody paid for us.
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:56.280]   I'd like the idea of crowdsourcing it.
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.280]   There are lots of ways to do it.
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:02.400]   And that's the point is there, there needs to be for a ecosystem to be growing.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:06.720]   We've got to solve that because we've, we've moved from the days of mainstream content
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:10.640]   into this democratic form of content, which is so great.
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:16.960]   Do you remember Michael Robertson of MP3.com predicted the era of the middle class rockstar?
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.960]   And I think how much he, he was so right about that.
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:24.960]   But it's also, it's also middle class patrons and middle class, you know, media moguls and
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:25.960]   middle class.
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:30.080]   I mean, it's, it's amazing these, these micro networks and the ability to reach an audience
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:34.140]   of just a couple thousand people is enough to, you know, my friends over who do the rage
[01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:39.200]   select podcast, you know, don't, you know, have a fraction of, of your numbers or even
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:43.520]   a my numbers, but they're super passionate and they're able to, to, to, you know, stay
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.040]   afloat doing because of direct contributions through Patreon.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:53.240]   It also affects, I mean, so where is subscription business not just to have revenue and sustain
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.160]   us, but it's, we think we write better content.
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:58.320]   So we don't cover the day to day tech news.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.520]   We focus on in-depth stories, the sort of drive the conversation that aren't being reported
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:04.840]   in the daily news cycle.
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.080]   But you know, I think different kinds of content, when you have certain business models, they
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.760]   encourage and create a type of content on top of that model.
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:17.840]   And so one of the things that's exciting about we're sort of seeing the subscription blossom
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:22.160]   a bit in the media business is because I think it's going to change the more types of content
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:25.280]   that we see will have greater diversity and we'll have more depth.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.640]   There's always been the concern that investigative journalism, for instance, which is very expensive
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:32.520]   would die without these big patrons, patrons.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:38.120]   But it's clear that we're starting to see now a way that this can work.
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:45.440]   And I love Michael Robertson's middle class rockstar and middle class patron too, because
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:52.000]   of course it was only the metachies that could have enough money, enough surplus to
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.360]   have Michelangelo paint, but now anybody can.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.000]   You know, a couple of bucks here, a couple of bucks there.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.120]   And I think that's a more natural system and I think more sustainable.
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:07.840]   Personal level, you get a much more tailor made experience like because of the on the
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:11.440]   one hand, you know, yes, it's a problem that everything's so fractious nowadays.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.640]   We all live our own little social bubbles.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:18.720]   But the benefit of that is that you can you can find yourself connecting with content
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.880]   that's almost made specifically for you, which is an experience that that only the very rich
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.720]   were able to do just 20, 30 years ago.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:26.720]   We need that.
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:29.360]   People just they attached to some of this stuff.
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:34.040]   I mean, podcasts are a good example websites are a good example where they feel so attached
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:37.160]   to it and it used to be there was nothing you could do other than to send them.
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.040]   Maybe you buy a t-shirt if they do a t-shirt sale, but there's really nothing you could
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:43.840]   do to say I appreciate you other than, you know, just go to their site.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.200]   And that's the nice thing about something like patreon is you can say, I like this so much
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:52.840]   that yeah, I will throw in $5 every time you do this, you know, this podcast or $5 a
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.840]   month.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.280]   And you know, that you just couldn't do that before.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.480]   It's not the mandatory micro payment like to read this article, you must put in 10 cents.
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.400]   It's more like if you really love this stuff, support it, support it.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:06.200]   And you know, it's easy, which is it's a great idea.
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:13.000]   I think it's a really good way to also get feedback from the audience because you know,
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.280]   you know, you're not going to make it unless you find an audience.
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:18.000]   And that's it's so easy in mainstream media.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.520]   Make a show that has no audience that nobody wanted.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:24.920]   I'll tell you this is the other thing is you feel the pressure to well, there you're
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.920]   boss.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:30.020]   You don't get to blow them off and you're like, okay, this is what you want.
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:31.820]   Then I guess we're doing that now.
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:33.360]   So you're customers, right?
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.360]   All right, one last story.
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.360]   We didn't talk about Twitter.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:42.480]   Did anything to say about Twitter's first quarterly profit, first quarterly results?
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:44.960]   User growth was low, which scared a lot of investors.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.960]   And a lot of existing users tweet less.
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:48.960]   Engage less.
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:50.960]   Big spotlight on users.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.120]   Isn't that a surprise?
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:53.560]   Anybody user Twitter knows that?
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:54.560]   Right?
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:58.400]   Yeah, I actually think so we have we're working on some stuff on it because I don't actually
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.640]   think that user growth is the right only metric to look at Twitter's business right
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:03.640]   now.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:04.640]   User engagements, the metrics.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:07.960]   There's a lot and there's also different kinds of businesses that can go into but the
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:09.680]   results spook the market a little bit.
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:12.200]   But you know, the P multiple is still 50 or so.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.200]   I mean, it's huge.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:17.520]   So investors are still, you know, the stock is very, very, it's not.
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:18.520]   Sorry, not 50.
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:19.680]   It's way, way above 50.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:20.680]   More than 50?
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:24.320]   Oh, considerably the stock is at 50, but it's north of 100.
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.320]   It's the model.
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.320]   Wow.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.640]   So investors still have very high expectations for Twitter.
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.640]   Wow.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:35.720]   The speaking of Twitter, the dying Chinese moon rover, Jade Rabbit.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:40.760]   This is straight out of Wally tweeted it's goodbye.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:45.280]   The rover is going through the two week lunar night very cold.
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:50.240]   It's built to survive it, but normally it would fold up its little rover solar panels
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:54.720]   and hibernate and it wasn't able to due to a technical malfunction.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:59.880]   So there's some concern that after the lunar night ends that Jade Rabbit will be no more.
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:03.000]   And apparently it's Chinese miners who are tweeting for it.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000]   Now they say tweet.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.680]   I couldn't find the tweets.
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:08.040]   They're awfully long, but then I realized it is in Chinese.
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:14.040]   It's possible because it's such a compact language that this is 140 characters.
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:15.640]   It looks like it.
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:19.960]   Although I should have gone to bed this morning, my master's discovered something abnormal
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:22.520]   with my mechanical control system.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:24.840]   My masters are staying up all night.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:28.040]   That's he should talk about how like how I'm working for a solution.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:32.440]   I heard their eyes are looking more like my red rabbit eyes.
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:37.720]   Nevertheless, I'm aware I might not survive this lunar night.
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.720]   That's kind of beautiful.
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:40.360]   Only the Chinese could do this.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:46.440]   I think if this journey must come to an early end, I am not afraid whether or not the repairs
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:51.440]   are successful.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:55.600]   I believe even my malfunctions will provide my masters with valuable information and experience.
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:56.600]   I don't know.
[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:57.800]   It's hard not to cry when you read this.
[01:59:57.800 --> 01:59:59.480]   The sun has already set here.
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:01.320]   The temperature is falling very quickly.
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:02.800]   I've said a lot today.
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:06.240]   Yet I still feel it's not enough.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:07.520]   I'll tell everyone a secret.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:09.600]   You know, you should use a secret.
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:12.360]   Actually I'm not feeling especially sad.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:16.160]   Just like any other hero, I've only encountered a little problem.
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:17.920]   I'm not feeling on my own adventure.
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:19.320]   You think you're a hero now?
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:20.320]   Apparently.
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:21.320]   Jade Rabbit.
[02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:23.520]   Finally, Good night.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:25.000]   Planet Earth.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000]   Good night.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000]   Humanity.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000]   Ominous.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.960]   Yeah, no kidding.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.600]   I didn't think of that.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:32.600]   If you check out--
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:34.400]   I have this little missile here.
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:38.400]   If you check out Thursday nights, I want to say Daily Show with John Stewart.
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.360]   Patrick Stewart reads a dramatic reading.
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.920]   Why did you tell me?
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:42.920]   Here I am.
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:46.540]   You know that was good because you went a little more the Howl 9000 root than Patrick Stewart.
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:47.720]   Patrick did a little dramatic.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.720]   A little more dramatic.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:49.920]   All right, well--
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:51.480]   A little less Android.
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:54.360]   We'll do that as our bumper out of this show.
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:56.440]   I don't want to prolong the agony any longer.
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:57.440]   My mind is going.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:58.440]   My mind.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:00:59.440]   My mind.
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:00.440]   My mind.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.440]   My mind.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.440]   My mind.
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.440]   My mind.
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:04.440]   My mind.
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:05.440]   My mind.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.440]   Thank you so much, Jason Stelfer.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.440]   Being here, it's always a pleasure.
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:09.360]   Incomporable on 5x5 network.
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:10.360]   Yes, thank you.
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:11.360]   I am so jealous.
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.360]   You know, well, we had--
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.960]   I don't want to call her Sinestra.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.560]   We had Serenity Campbell on.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:18.560]   Sir, I got to Caldwell, right.
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:19.560]   Caldwell.
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:20.560]   Sinestra.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:21.560]   I don't know why.
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:22.560]   Sure.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:23.560]   Maleficent Caldwell was on.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:26.000]   She was talking about you do radio plays, you did the Christmas play.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000]   I listened to it.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000]   It was wonderful.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000]   Thank you.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000]   Great acting.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000]   Thank you.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000]   You know, it was good Glenn Fleischman.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000]   Glenn does a funny accent.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.480]   He can do a funny accent.
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:36.000]   He does the greatest doctor, whoever.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000]   Exactly.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000]   Anyway, theincomporable.com.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000]   Check it out.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000]   What is the story of this?
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.200]   This is just a bunch of Macworld editors and you and--
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.680]   It's a bunch of my friends and other people I've met.
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:49.000]   And we talk about geeky pop culture.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000]   So movies, TV shows, and stuff.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000]   It's broken heart of people.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000]   Never.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]   How many times you've been on my shows invited me to be on.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000]   We'll talk.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.600]   All of my audible recommendations that I do here are from there.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:01:59.600]   From the Incomporable.
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:00.600]   So highly recommended.
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:01.600]   Incomporable.com.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:02.600]   The Incomporable.com.
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:03.600]   The Incomporable.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:04.600]   The--
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:05.600]   Like the information.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:06.600]   You got to have the thought.
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:10.000]   Apparently, was Patrick Stewart dressed as a Jade Rabbit as well?
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000]   He was.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.800]   If I had known that, I would not have assayed that reading, that dramatic reading.
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:18.800]   Mr. Brian Brushwood, NSFW.
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:19.800]   Great to have you.
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:22.800]   Phil, Phil, you feel jealous you got the information.
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:23.800]   You got the Incomporable.
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:26.320]   I feel like it needs to be the hacking the system.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:28.040]   I think so.
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.040]   The hacking system.
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:32.040]   What is this with the definite article everywhere?
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:33.040]   The Twitch.
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:34.040]   Dot coms are hard to find, man.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.040]   It feels like a publication, you know.
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:37.040]   Ah, that's it.
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:38.040]   It's the one, the only.
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:39.040]   The--
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.840]   I used to work at a radio station that was the--
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:41.840]   Sports leader.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:42.840]   Yeah.
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:43.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:44.840]   Great to have you, Brian.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:45.840]   I appreciate it.
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:46.840]   Good luck on the show.
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:50.280]   Can't wait to see it hacking the system on that geo on February 27.
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.280]   Yeah.
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:55.360]   And, of course, scam school on revision three.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:56.360]   Yeah.
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:00.680]   Jessica Lesson is at theinformation.com.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:03.680]   And was information.com taken?
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:08.200]   We were going after both of them, but the came up first, and so we just went for it.
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:09.200]   I kind of like it.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:10.200]   Mm-hmm.
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:11.200]   Yeah, it does.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:12.200]   Media publications.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.280]   You have The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times.
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:15.280]   The Ohio State University.
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.280]   Yeah.
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:17.280]   Although, it's kind of funny.
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.920]   I have this sheet of names that I've carried around for six months when we were coming up
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:23.240]   with the name, and we just got it framed and put it in the office.
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.240]   Oh, that's fun.
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:28.280]   And there's a big X in front of the the, which makes me think at one point in my brain, I
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:29.280]   decided we did the--
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:30.280]   No, the.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:31.280]   But now, forever.
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:32.280]   That's a little secret, but forever.
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:33.280]   We have it.
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:34.280]   We have the--
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:35.280]   The the.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:36.280]   There is the there.
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:37.480]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:41.640]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:43.400]   That's 3 plus 12 is 5.
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:44.400]   That's a casual care.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.880]   The 7 was a 2,200 UTC on the Twit Network, Twit.tv.
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:51.280]   If you're watching, we love it if you watch live.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:54.560]   If you can't on-demand audio and video is always available after the fact.
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:57.560]   At Twit.tv and wherever you can find that cast.
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:59.840]   You know, we had some great shows this week.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:03.880]   I'm not sure I want to show this promo because I understand there's some brief nudity.
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:04.880]   What?
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.280]   Take a look.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:07.440]   This is what you missed.
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:09.320]   This week on Twit.
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.760]   Previously on Twit.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:12.760]   Tech News today.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.520]   So the current funding system is just really focused on small incremental projects.
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:18.920]   That's where we hope to come in.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:22.840]   Give these kind of wild risky, innovative ideas a platform.
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:24.320]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:27.360]   Let's put it in the good news corner because Microsoft needs some good news.
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:32.440]   And that is Windows 8.1 has become more popular than this stuff.
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:33.840]   This week in law.
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:40.600]   I'd like to start with something Dawn wrote comparing the copyright wars with the alcohol
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:41.600]   prohibition.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.120]   High five for the iPhone.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:44.400]   The game is evil.
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:45.400]   It is mean.
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:49.520]   And I refuse to participate in the losing game that is Flappy Bird.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.520]   Flap, flap, flap.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:51.520]   Twit.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:52.520]   Tech.
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:53.520]   Just like you like it.
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:54.520]   Yes.
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:57.520]   Well, make sure you tell me next time.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.920]   By the way, I hear that Nick Milton's next to...
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:00.920]   Oh, God!
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:01.920]   My friends.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:02.920]   My eyes.
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:03.920]   Where?
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:08.680]   Next book is going to be called Hatching Flappy Bird.
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:11.840]   The behind the scenes Troy.
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:13.160]   It's more of a pamphlet.
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:14.160]   It's short.
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:15.160]   E-book.
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:17.160]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.800]   We'll see you next time.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:26.920]   Another Twit is in the game.
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:29.920]   Do it the Twit.
