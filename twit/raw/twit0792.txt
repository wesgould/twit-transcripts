[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's time for Twits. This week in Tech, the show where we take a look at the week's tech news with our esteemed panel of Twits.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's a rotating panel, but everybody on the panel today has been twitified in the past.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You'll know their names. Let's start with Christina Warren film girl.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   She's a senior developer advocate now, a cloud advocate at Microsoft. Not traveling these days.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Nope. No, unfortunately.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I had to transfer some of my Marriott points to a friend earlier today because she is flying back to where she's been staying during this time.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   She's about to fly back home.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I have a hotel room to stay in before I fly.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It was so depressing. I mean, like walking into my Marriott account.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   My point.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   My beautiful point. It's all gone.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   What's great to have you?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   No, my points aren't gone.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   There's nothing to do with them.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Eventually they'll expire, right? Don't they expire eventually?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I think you have to use them for some way. I'll find a way.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Before that happens, I've got too many of them.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Yeah, points will find a way. I think the points guy had a whole article on what to do is if your line points are expiring.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Here's a guy who has a few points.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Phil Libin, he is currently CEO of all turtles at all dash turtles.com, which is an incubator for AI.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   All sorts of cool AI stuff. He's using his latest.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Hi, Phil. Good to see you.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Good to see you. I, for one, am happy to see you.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   My United points going unused this year.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah, I bet. I bet you are.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Mm-hmm.app for Mm-hmm, which is a very cool app.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   By the way, congratulations. I saw you just got some big round of funding.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Timing couldn't be better for this. There's Phil himself.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It gives you a virtual background you can use with your Zoom calls.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Your Skype calls it also gives you, it's kind of got a presentation field as well so you can have over the shoulder graphics and stuff.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Very cool. Very cool. I'm glad you're doing well with that.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And now you just have little fake clouds floating behind you.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Slowly drifting.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Little ducks. I'm in it for the ducks.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   They're mobile. They're animated. That's pretty cool.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yeah, it moves, right?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And that was Denise Howell, a longtime friend of the networker, showed this weekend.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Law, of course, was long running on Twitch. No longer I'm sad to say.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Denise Howell.info, her website at D. Howell.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Things are, I'm glad to see the kitchen is still there and doing well.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   This isn't my kitchen. This is my office.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I always thought it was your kitchen. Why did I think that?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   There's no appliances.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   There's no appliances. Just gas masks.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So there's, actually it's a little slow this week.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Perhaps because everybody's waiting to see what Apple does on Tuesday.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   We are getting an Apple event.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   You know, it's, I suppose we shouldn't even spend any time talking about it because all will be revealed day after tomorrow.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It's amazing though.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   At Kristina, you've been an Apple fan for years. It's amazing how we pretty much now,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   we pretty much nowadays before these events, even with Apple, which was famous for secrecy,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   we pretty much are not surprised by these events anymore.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   No, the Apple part is the thing that I guess has been surprising me and that's really been something that's only been,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I guess maybe the last three years or so where it's been consistent.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Like before we used to always get some kind of leaks in advance and some kind of predictions,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   but at this point, like it's now very accurate to the point that,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   and sometimes Apple themselves have been like the source of the leaks, which is the obvious, the funniest part.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So that's interesting. Why would, so they leak out stuff that was always a rumor to Wall Street.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   If the journal had a story about an Apple event, it was probably from Apple, that kind of thing.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Right. No, no, no, no. What I meant was there have been instances where there have been like unprotected source code or things on their website
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   that can have found that I think that's a difference.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And mistakes, exactly. Or they will have references to new hardware in certain iOS or macOS builds,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   that sort of thing. And I think in one case, there was actually like an entire like almost like outline of a full release
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   of some sort of products or something that again was, it was a mistake.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   But what's happened recently, like the latest leak comes from someone in China, which that's interesting.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And I have to wonder if that is partially impacted because of the pandemic that maybe they don't have as many people
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   on the ground there as usual to kind of like be protectionist.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   What they've been doing according to some of the resources like Mark Herman at Bloomberg is chartering flights to send Apple employees to China,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   but also for the most part, putting people on Zoom calls or whatever, probably Apple uses FaceTime, but on video calls to look at parts and spec parts.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And this is a big part of the process of manufacture in China as they make prototypes. You have to approve them.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Exactly. It's a fairly elaborate process. And I presume by now Apple's making the funds.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Although if the rumors are to be believed in nine to five Mac has a rundown of all the rumors, only a couple of these models
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   are available to order this week, particularly the iPhone 12, which is the base model, the 6.1 inch iPhone 12,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   will be pre-orders will be Friday according to the rumors and available the following week, as is often the case with an Apple event.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Also oddly the pro, but not the iPhone 12 mini, which is I think one of the most interesting things.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   It's selling a 5.4 inch display, but that won't be available till November, order November 6th or 7th, available November 13th or 14th.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   That's a month off. And the big one, the most expensive one, the iPhone 12 pro max starts at 1100 bucks pre-orders according to nine to five Mac,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   according to the rumors, November 13th, a month after the event and shipping the following week, November 30th,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   so you're going to wait a long time if you're going to get the top of the line or even the bottom of the line.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   It's the middle phones that will be available all OLED and all with 5G.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And this is one thing that's bothering me a little bit. We saw this with the Pixel 5.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Anybody who's selling through Verizon, which obviously is both Google and that Google I think has a Verizon exclusive with the Pixel 5,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   and Apple has to put in millimeter wave. I have a feeling you would know better than I do,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   but I'm getting the sense millimeter wave is available in a tiny proportion of the country corners of NFL stadiums,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   a couple of floors on Manhattan high rises, that kind of thing.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I think it's kind of weird how the whole 5G industry in this country has just become just all full of lies.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   There's a good way to put it.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Because everyone just lies about it.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Like AT&T.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Yeah, like my phone right now says I'm on AT&T 5GE, where the E stands for lies.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   The E stands for lies.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   So I think the industry is like intentionally for some strange reason, completely destroyed their credibility with it to the point where
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I just have a hard time carrying now because I just assume anything.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Anytime I hear the word 5G, I assume someone's lying to me.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And it's like blockchain.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Yeah, the thing that bothers me is apparently these millimeter wave radios are an extra $100 on the bill of goods.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   So you could make the Pixel phone a hundred bucks less.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   You could make each of these iPhones a hundred bucks less.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You're paying a premium for a feature you probably will never have access to.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Or if you do, it'll be for a limited time.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   That's really disappointing to me.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   But I guess that maybe some of this is because all of these funds will be sold in China where 5G is more available.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   It just seems like almost a tax.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   The 5G tax on users.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Well, it might be, you know, it may increase the cost of the bill of materials, but having fewer skews may decrease the overall cost of everything.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   So it's not actually clear that it would be cheaper if we needed to have multiple versions of some without.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Interesting.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I mean, this is unusual for Apple to announce.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   If this is the case, again, it's just a rumor for phones at one time.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   They've had good success with an iPhone SE, which they would update every few years.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Those have always been very popular.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   That's the less expensive iPhone.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And then they'd have like a base model and a big model.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   But for phones in one, I can't remember them doing that any time in the past.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   So they do this.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Which one of them is going to be transparent?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   None of them.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Thank you, Robert Scoville.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   None of them.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   He still owes me dinner for that bum prediction for two or three years ago.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   All OLED, Apple is finally moving to all OLED.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Just when the world is about to move to mini LED, I don't know what, even Apple's moving to mini LED for its computers.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   All OLED, new colors.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   The mini will come in red, white, and blue, as well as black and green.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So will the 12, you'll get gold and silver on the pros, as well as graphite and blue.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   So colors are, whatever I see colors in a phone, it tells me that the new features are not enough to distinguish it from last year's models.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So they have to do something.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   How dare you?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Rose gold was a feature.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   There isn't much to tout on this.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I presume they'll use the A14 chip they have in the iPad Air.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Anyway, we'll do our normal stream, our normal challenge to Apple to take us down.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   We do that every month now, it seems like.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And according to Mark Gurman and Bloomberg, he buried it in a story a couple of days ago.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   There will be yet another Apple event in November to announce Apple Silicon, the new.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   For the laptops or whatever.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   So you can see the events.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Apple, Apple's going crazy.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   They've done multiple events before, but I can't remember them.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   This spread out like it.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   This is usually what they would do is they would like combine the iPad with the Mac event or the iPad with the iPhone event.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   But I have a feeling, I mean, as with everybody that everyone's, you know, they had these phones and development for years, obviously before.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   COVID and that have massive implications on their manufacturing, which I'm sure is part of the reason why there have been delays.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   But also changes mean some of the features that you're really excited about are maybe not going to be as relevant as they were, you know, when they were in development 24 months ago.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Right.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Just because the nature of how we use things is different.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   So.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   We'll be here 10 a.m. Pacific time.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   That's 1 p.m. Eastern time.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Michael Sargin and I right after iOS today, we'll start that early.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   We'll sit down and watch the event.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Try not to get taken down by Apple and the Mac break weekly immediately after that.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Phil, you've led many companies to companies look at what Apple does with its events and its marketing with envy.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   You certainly seem to be that way in the Steve Jobs era where just nobody would command attention like Steve at one of these events.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And we worked with Apple pretty closely in the early, ever no days and we basically synchronized our whole release roadmap around Apple events and what we thought would be important to them.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   We used to play Apple Bingo in the office where we would distribute Bingo cards for what we thought they would announce.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And it was a significant portion of our own planning.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   It was nerd Christmas, right?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   There's some of that still hangs out, but without Steve, by the way, 11th anniversary of his passing last week, without Steve around, it's not nearly as exciting as it used to be.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   However, you can't say that Apple is not a juggernaut.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   You think it's as exciting as it was?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Well, I think like WWDC this year was the best one they've ever had in terms of like, just from an audience perspective.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I think Apple has really loved WWDC.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And they were the first company to come out and say, "Well, it's not wine about how it has to be virtual, so it's not going to be quite as good as the in-person events. It was just better."
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Let's make it better.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I've been to most of the in-person events and Apple said for WWDC 2020, "We're just going to make it better than it's ever been," and they did it.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   So it's kind of amazing.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   So yeah, I think in many ways it's more significant than it was before.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   From the point of view of end users for sure, and also for the press, having the time to carefully craft these videos seems to have benefited Apple quite a bit.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I think that a lot of us are saying, "You know, you should just keep doing it this way Apple."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   It's funny because Google, I don't know what's going on.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   We talked about this last week.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Google, like it said, "We're not going to do IO. It's too much trouble."
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   So they not only did they delay it, they canceled it.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Not only in no in-person, no video, nothing.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And then this last Google event, actually the Pixel 5 was the most unkind way to put it would be relaxed.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   It was the most laid-back presentation I've ever seen, and they barely spent two minutes on the Pixel 5.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It feels like Google's just lost the thread. They're just not that interested anymore.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   What's hard?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   You know, every time we go ahead, Christina.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   No, I was just going to say it's difficult. I can only speak from the perspective of I worked with Microsoft.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   But Microsoft's doing a good job on the Microsoft events. I really have enjoyed those.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   No, and I worked on Microsoft, they worked on Ignite.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And I definitely think that I'm just saying I can understand it's difficult.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   If it's not something, especially if events have a big company.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   They are.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Microsoft could do it. Google's going, "Yeah."
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Well, I would say that even though Google's a massive company, I don't know how important events have historically been to them as a core competency.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Whereas Apple events have always been a really known thing for them.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   WWDC is a known thing.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Their iPhone events are a known thing.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   With us, with shows like Build and Ignite, those are really big shows that we have lots of other events throughout the year too.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And I'm certainly not trying to say that Google doesn't do other events, but I owe so much of it, at least traditionally, was about kind of the live spectacle that I can understand that having to figure out how you're going to transition that could be difficult.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And maybe they just decided it wasn't worth the investment.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I do agree with you though that the pixel events was interesting.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   It's kind of like a cluster.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   It's probably really hard to get excited about a new phone and selling a new phone right now because the phone's also good.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Yeah, but if you don't, then customers aren't either.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Right.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   But I mean, maybe they're just putting out too many new phones too frequently.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   My 10 finally died a couple of months ago.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And I had to get an 11 and we knew that the 12 would be coming hard on the heels of that because I had to get an 11, right?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   So I knew as I was buying the thing, oh, the new one will be here in a matter of months, and sure enough.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   But did you feel bad because you had to buy what will be an obsolete phone?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   No.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   No, I still feel like I'm leaving in the future.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   There is no way that I'm using all the features of this phone.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I'm probably using 10% of the features of this phone.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   So there's an easy fix for Google for this to reinsert excitement into their shows.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I've suggested this before, they just ignore me. They need to start pronouncing it as Googlio.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   [laughter]
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Boom.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Just do the mental experiment.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Maybe more fun.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Googlio.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   The new Googlio.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Googlio.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   That's what they need to do.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   It sounds like a nice Italian company.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Maybe they should be making typewriters.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Googlio.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   No, no, the company can say "Googol."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Just the event.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   It's a Googlio.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's not Googlio.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Oh, I thought you wanted to change the name of the company.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   No, no, no, it's fine.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Just googlio.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Googlio.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   It's like the world's most boring event.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Googol.io.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   It's so close to Googlio.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Googlio.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Googlio.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I love it.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Well, you get Christina. You get a little bit of a pass from the House of Representatives.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   For some reason, Microsoft left out of this.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   We're going to talk a little bit about the Congressional report that came out this week after 18-month
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   investigation.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   They talked to everybody.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   They got a lot of evidence, a lot of emails, and they came out with a 450-page report condemning
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Big Tech and saying, "We probably ought to break up Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple."
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   They didn't mention Microsoft.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Did you feel left out a little bit?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   It was interesting because I did actually do a search for Microsoft.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   If you do a search in the document, it's like we mentioned 400 times.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.720]   But not as one of the focus things.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.200]   It's interesting though, because a lot of the things that are cited were the Justice Department
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   case.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.600]   It's like you've been through it already.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.000]   So we don't have to bother you again.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Well, that was a really interesting thing.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.120]   And I'm obviously not a lawyer, but this is the thing that I think to me is kind of instructive
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.240]   about this, is that we've kind of gone through this before.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.520]   And I think that the cynical part of me is going, regardless of whether or not it would
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.160]   be even feasible to split some of these companies up.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.400]   Taking that aside, let's pretend that it is.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.600]   And it might not be in some circumstances the way that they would want to.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.760]   But let's pretend that it would be.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.240]   The cynical part of me doesn't think that it's likely in the slightest for lots of reasons.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:27.080]   But the biggest one being that when there was a Justice Department investigation, to be
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.920]   clear, this is not a Justice Department investigation.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:36.480]   This is just Congress basically wanting to maybe push the Justice Department to take action.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.040]   What wound up happening was the settlements, and most of it was overturned.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.240]   And so it obviously had a massive impact on Microsoft as a company, and I think changed
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.520]   the way that they've done business going on.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:54.600]   I think had a massive change on their trajectory in terms of maybe slowing certain things down
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:01.480]   or certain things happened that maybe wouldn't have happened if that trial hadn't happened
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.840]   and if that settlement hadn't happened.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.400]   But ultimately, the company remained intact.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   And 20 years later.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.200]   >> It did not break them up, there were some who said.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   >> It didn't break them up.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:17.720]   And 20 years later, they're mentioned repeatedly in this report, but not as the subject as
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.440]   one of the companies being targeted, which is interesting, right?
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:27.080]   So the cynical part of me kind of says, even if you accept the idea that these are things
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.040]   that should be done and it's feasible for this to happen, I don't actually think that
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:39.600]   we will see these big companies split up, at least not the way that people might envision
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   it being split up.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.820]   >> I want to take a little break because I do want to get deeper into this and thank
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.800]   goodness we have an actual attorney present.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.440]   So you can analyze this a little bit better for us.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.840]   But the House Committee on the Judiciary's Eddy Trust Subcommittee finally came out with
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.560]   this very long report.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:03.080]   A report that was not, by the way, bipartisan as we thought it would be initially, it was
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.280]   a report from the Democrats, Republicans would not sign on to it because they didn't like
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   the idea of breaking these companies up, which is a kind of traditional Republican point
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.280]   of view.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.320]   And they didn't like the fact that it didn't mention censorship of conservative voices,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   which apparently was a big issue for some of them, particularly Jim Jordan and Matt Gates
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.400]   and people like that.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:32.800]   But we will take a break and give you a chance to get your thoughts together.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.960]   And maybe if you want, we'll give you a minute to read the 450 page report.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.440]   I actually went through it on this week in Google, almost page by page.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.920]   It was gripping, gripping.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.040]   We'll do that in just a second.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.080]   Denise Hals here, it's great to have you, Denise, from this week in law, Phil Libben,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.960]   one of the CEOs of Evernote, almost creator of Evernote, creator of half of Evernote.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.840]   Is that fair to say that, Phil?
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.360]   You did half of Evernote.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.920]   I think far less than half.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.920]   Okay.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.920]   One or two percent.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   Okay.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.000]   Did a little bit more with all turtles.com where he founded and CEO there.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.080]   And he, of course, is now working on and using his dog fooding.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   Mm hmm.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.560]   And it looks pretty darn good.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.840]   We're going to get in a tour of paper land.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.040]   It's been fun.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:24.520]   Also from Microsoft, where she is a senior cloud advocate and still are always will be
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.720]   our film girl, Christina Warren.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.760]   Great to see you.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.240]   We had your cohort last week, Simone de Rush four from Rocket.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.560]   And she was, she was really good.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.280]   We had a lot of fun with Simone.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   But you know what?
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   That's, that show is a great show.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.760]   Brianna Wu, Christina Warren, Simone de Rush four, that is like three of my favorite people
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.120]   on one program.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.280]   You do a good job.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.280]   That's a really great show.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   Thank you.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   Thank you so much.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.280]   We just celebrated 300 episodes, which was great.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   Wow.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.280]   Wow.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:00.000]   So today brought to you as it often is by our friends who put me to sleep.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Casper.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.400]   Now, this is a case where you really do want to get nice and quiet and sleepy and not too
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.840]   over agitated.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.880]   Every time you go to bed, you're going to spend hours a third of your day and in bed,
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.680]   you ought to have a great mask mattress.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.360]   You've all heard of Casper.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.800]   You know, I've talked about Casper.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.960]   There I am with my brand new Casper king size mattress.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.280]   Look at that.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.040]   It's a surprisingly compact box.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.300]   They're the sleep company without rages, sleep comfortable products at far less than
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:35.040]   outrageous prices from award-winning mattresses to pillows and sheets and duvets.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:41.000]   Casper is transforming the way we sleep once news at a time.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.200]   Oh, I love our Casper mattress.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.440]   We I use the Casper pillows.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.840]   We had a Casper dog bed.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.280]   They have bedding bed frames.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.640]   Yes, dog beds.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.040]   Everything you need to build the bed of your dreams.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.880]   Every Casper mattress is designed with one thing in mind to react and adapt to your body
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.960]   all night long.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:07.160]   Precisely, I counted them 1,501 perforations to create a cooling system so effective, you
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.640]   won't even notice it.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.520]   But sleeping cool is so important.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.760]   Only Casper mattresses are made with 86 supportive gel pods.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.640]   So they align to your spine, eliminate aches and pains.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:25.160]   Together, it's the cooling, supportive comfort you need for the most refreshing feeling.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.400]   Come morning.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.320]   And one of the ways that Casper works is you don't have to go to a showroom.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.880]   Those mattress showrooms double the price of your mattress.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.960]   Casper saves you a ton of money.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:43.680]   And instead of trying a mattress in the showroom for a few minutes, you can try it for 100
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.680]   nights.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   Risk free.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.840]   Sleep on a trial with free shipping and painless returns to the US and Canada.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.320]   But you know what?
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.520]   They're never going to get my Casper out of my hands.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.600]   I love my Casper mattress.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:02.360]   20,000 reviews on Casper Amazon and Google, an average of 4.8 stars.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.960]   Casper is easily becoming the Internet's favorite mattress.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:13.800]   And now with 0% APR financing options, there's no reason not to try a Casper tonight.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.480]   It really is fantastic.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.840]   It's almost as if they were planning for this thing.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.840]   And someday, people won't be able to go to a mattress store, but they'll want a really
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.720]   good night's sleep.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.920]   We'll be there for them.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.720]   Casper.com/twit1.

[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.840]   Casper.com/twit1.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.840]   The offer code is TWIT1.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   A good night's sleep.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.640]   It's hard these days sometimes to sleep.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.360]   You got a lot on your mind.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.600]   There's a lot going on in the world.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.480]   Don't let your mattress be the thing in between you and a good night's sleep.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.360]   Don't let your mattress be the thing in between.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.760]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   I'm going to go to that special address that's going on in between.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.920]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.200]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.680]   I'm going to go to that special address.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:47.600]   A good overview gloss on considering all this is when you go back and remember that
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:55.040]   anti-trust scrutiny from 1990 through 2002-2012.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.520]   It just dragged on.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:07.640]   Now, the mentions in the report are referencing all that past stuff we learned about.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:15.080]   Going after a tech giant in anti-trust proceedings.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.000]   It reminds me of most of all is that famous quote from Ferris Bueller that life moves
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.440]   pretty fast.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.920]   If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:30.200]   I feel like in this industry life moves very fast and life has moved quite fast for Microsoft
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:37.160]   and they are no longer an anti-trust threat as far as Congress is concerned.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.440]   If they looked around a little while, they might find that Google and/or Facebook and
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   or Apple and or Amazon might be less of a threat a little ways down the road too.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.320]   I'm in some very fluid kind of business.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.480]   Does anyone really feel that Facebook is going to be the be all and end all of social
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.600]   networking say 12 years from now?
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   I don't think so.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.360]   I'm going to say something controversial, I guess.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:11.160]   I think that the DOJ action against Microsoft was a success and that the consent decree
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.720]   that Microsoft eventually did sign up for which include by the way somebody on site,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:22.880]   ombudsman on site, monitoring their behavior to make sure that they didn't behave anti-competitively.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.920]   Help Microsoft a lot.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.440]   It steered them in the right direction.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:35.560]   It opened up the paved the way for things like Google and Facebook to emerge and Microsoft
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.560]   has done very well.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.680]   I think that it was actually a success on both sides.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.400]   It was good for Microsoft and I think it was good for the country.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   Is that?
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:51.280]   I'm not going to dispute that at all, but I do feel like what Congress has done here is
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:57.680]   basically take on these companies for being big as opposed to being monopolies and or
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.280]   engaging in anti-competitive practices.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:07.920]   That's where I feel like they lost their bipartisan support and where I feel like this
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.600]   could just sort of peter out.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:16.920]   I guess the biggest part of the report, the biggest ask that it makes is for Congress
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.840]   to alter the antitrust laws.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:26.960]   They have more flexibility and maybe the antitrust laws resemble more or relate more
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:33.520]   to what's going on in the current technology industry, which they're very ill fitted to
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.360]   right now.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:41.360]   You had that great piece in the rundown on anti-monopoly versus--
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   Ben Thompson.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.360]   Oh, Ben Thompson.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.360]   Yes, Ben Thompson's piece.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   I encourage people to read that.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:53.720]   I wrote a scholar in economic policy, William Letwin, who wrote a book on the evolution
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.920]   of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:02.000]   Actually, I want to read this quote because it kind of gets to the heart of the matter.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.160]   Letwin says that hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.600]   Like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.360]   differently at different times.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.520]   Monopoly, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:25.960]   granted by the state, like your cable company has a monopoly, unfortunately.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.880]   Later it came to more often mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.320]   own efforts, but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.360]   raised obstacles to the equality of opportunity.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.920]   I think that that is a legitimate fear.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   If there is a failing in the free market economy, it is possible in a free market economy for
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:56.480]   a company to become so powerful that its dominance allows it to enter and control other markets,
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:01.960]   which essentially destroys the competitive competition that makes free market work.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.280]   And so I think that that is one of the few controls that a government must exert on a
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.760]   free market is this control of monopoly.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.960]   Now Phil, I have no idea where you stand on this, so I'm going to let you tell me I'm
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.040]   full of it if you want.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.400]   I think this is the man with a hammer syndrome.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.040]   You only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:33.320]   I think that the big tech companies are doing a lot of harm to the world.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.640]   A lot of good as well, but clearly some harm.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.320]   And I think the looking into the harm that they're causing and trying to figure out ways
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.360]   to mitigate that harm is super important.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.640]   I'm just not sure that breaking them up actually achieves that in any way.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.640]   I think the...
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.480]   And as Christine pointed out, we didn't break up Microsoft, but we still were able to make
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.280]   to get to accomplish some things.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.960]   And I think that the harm that Microsoft was doing, even allegedly, and I kind of agree
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.760]   with you that the consent degree was probably a good thing overall.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.680]   But that was like, okay, yeah, my guests are shutting out some competitors.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:15.960]   The harm that Facebook's doing has much more to do with the harm they're causing to the
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.640]   rest of the world, not so much on companies that may want to compete with face-hits.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.320]   I think antitrust is a very narrow lens to look at this through.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.800]   And the idea that the reflexive reaction is let's break the companies up.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.520]   I think that's going to make a lot of things worse.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.600]   I think Facebook broken up into 10 parts is completely not fair to me.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   Why that's not 10 times worse than Facebook right now.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.080]   Well, it's just like the easy answer.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.840]   As Zenny's pointed out, I mean, the good news is, A, this is not even a nonpartisan report.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.600]   The Republicans disagree about the breaking up as well.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.200]   B, Congress has a few other things to think about.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:58.160]   C, there's an election three weeks away, and they're going to be a lame-duck Congress.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.880]   It doesn't look like anything's going to be happening.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.880]   Anytime soon.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.880]   Right.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.680]   And I really like Phil's point that we don't necessarily need a hammer and this isn't necessarily
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   a nail.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.080]   There are a lot of other laws that are available.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:18.200]   I'm thinking that California pops to mind has a really broad and sweeping unfair competition
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   law.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.040]   And it seems like some of the things that are complained about in the 450 page report.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.840]   By the way, Wired has a really nice 14 juiciest quotes from the House.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.640]   And I trust the report, if you're looking for a cheat sheet.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.800]   That is clearly link bait.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.880]   There is nothing juicy in this report.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.880]   It's the, okay, good.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.800]   I'm going to have to look that up.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.400]   Looking for sort of the meat and what, you know, I mean, it's hard from the coverage
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.400]   I've read of it.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.840]   And as I said, I did not go through all 450 pages.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:53.320]   But what commentators tend to come up with having read through it and God love them for
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:35:01.400]   having done that for us is that there wasn't a lot of concrete example given of anti-competitive
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.840]   or monopolistic behavior.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.040]   Yeah, the complaint seemed to be we've got big companies doing bad things.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.040]   Right.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.960]   We've got big, you know, if we've got any company doing bad things, we have a lot of laws we
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.440]   can use to address that.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:19.200]   I actually think that we feel you nailed it, so to speak, because for instance, with the
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.720]   problem with Facebook is not that they're so big, it's the monopoly, not the monopoly
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.320]   and Facebook defends itself saying, well, you know, there's the whole internet to compete
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.760]   with us.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:37.400]   It's just that they have such power and dominance over the discourse in this country that's
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   scary.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.600]   Yeah, there's a country with the world.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   The world.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   Yes.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:50.120]   I think there's a class of problems that can be solved by restricting what companies do
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   in general.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.480]   There's a different class of problems and a much smaller class of problems that could
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.120]   be solved by breaking up a single company.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.760]   We just, I think for historical reasons, just immediately go to the, oh, they're big,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.160]   so they break them up, and it just never made any sense to me.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:14.120]   If you had 10 companies and they were all just dumping cyanide into the water, because
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.880]   that's what they decided to do, but there was 10 of them.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.080]   Clearly, none of them were a competitor, were a monopoly.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.400]   They were just 10, and they were equally sized, and there were 10 companies dumping cyanide
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.640]   into the water and killing everyone.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   That's a problem.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.040]   Anti-trust is not a solution to that.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.800]   You would just be like, hey, no company can now dump cyanide into the water.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.560]   You wouldn't take the biggest one and break them up, which wouldn't necessarily fix the
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   problem.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   This is what we have now.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:43.000]   We have social media, makes money by keeping you upset.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Yes.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.280]   Social media makes money when you are upset.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   Yes.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.440]   That's a problem, and it's a problem if there's a monopoly doing it, and it's a problem if
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.360]   there's 50 companies evenly distributed doing it.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:59.400]   The problem is that business model is deeply detrimental to the world, and shouldn't exist.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:05.720]   I'm like, I share a lot of the suspicion of big tech and the desire to improve it, but
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.880]   I think the only people I trust less are probably the Congress.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:18.320]   Yeah, I think anti-trust is just doesn't seem like the right framework for this at all.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:24.200]   Here's one example from that 14 juiciest quotes piece and wire that jumped out at me.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:30.680]   One of the things the report calls out is that certain employees at Microsoft, Amazon,
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:38.960]   were other Seattle companies, were getting information about the third-party sellers
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:44.760]   marketplace due to their role at Amazon, the data they were able to access because they
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.960]   were employees there.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:51.600]   Then they were establishing their own side hustle where they could compete more readily
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.760]   as a third-party seller on the marketplace because of the information that they're getting
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.640]   straight from their employer.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:05.480]   That's not the employer's problem except for those people you should be fired and disciplined.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.160]   That's not an antitrust issue.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.760]   I should also point out as others have that Walmart does the same thing.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.680]   Every grocery store in the country can do the same thing.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.880]   They know what's selling.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:24.440]   When grocery store came out with generic goods, unlabeled goods, I'm sure they use data about
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.040]   which products sold the best to determine which generic goods to sell.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.440]   That's called retail.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.440]   Right.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:38.520]   But to Nises point, if employees are going to be taking information that they gather in
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:44.000]   the course of their job to establish a secondary business that competes against employees.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.560]   That's the employees fault.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.560]   Exactly.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.000]   That's exactly it.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   I'm sure that it's in.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.040]   I would be shocked because I know my handbook, we have very set out rules for how moonlighting
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040]   works.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.920]   Our agreement is actually really robust and allows us to do a lot of things that you
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   would think maybe you wouldn't.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.080]   But there are very clear lines.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.000]   That would be a clear line which is to be like, "Okay, if you have access to this information,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.400]   it's kind of like SEC rules around insider trading and stuff like that."
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:17.440]   To me, that seems like, "Okay, that should be about either enacting laws that make people
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:25.760]   who break handbook guidelines or whatever, things like that illegal or working to mitigate
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   that in some other way."
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.680]   But it doesn't seem like it's antitrust just because someone has access to something that
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.320]   chooses to act in a way that is unethical.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:41.280]   I remember actually when, remember Bezos and Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.600]   were testifying via Zoom to Congress.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.760]   I remember when they asked Jeff Bezos about this very subject and he said, "Well, if that's
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:54.440]   happening, that's against the rules and I don't like it, but I don't know if it's happening.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.000]   I don't think he'd be too pleased to know that that was happening."
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.240]   So that's a ridiculous...
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.640]   Yeah, and I think that there was, and I don't know if this was in the report, I skimmed the
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   report.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.800]   I read portions of it, but I have to admit it was long.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   I didn't say who could read it.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   It's 450 pages.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   No apologies.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   Exactly.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   I have other things that I want to read.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   It's not the most exciting.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   Right.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.600]   But there were some allegations in the Wall Street Journal that Amazon itself was taking
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.800]   some information based on products that people were selling to then directly create their
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.000]   own competitive products.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Yes.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.680]   That I think becomes a little bit trickier.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.480]   You could point to the Walmart example of maybe white labeled goods or whatnot.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.520]   I think it's a little bit different if you're talking about saying, "Hey, we're going to
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.520]   create an Amazon basics or we're going to promote these things in the same way to go
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.320]   after this market segment."
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.720]   That maybe becomes a little bit swishier, but I still don't know if that becomes an antitrust
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   thing.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.600]   Because as you said, this is retail.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.560]   Nor is it an excuse to break Amazon up.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.560]   Right.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.760]   By the way, I don't know how you would break up Amazon.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.240]   Well, that's the other thing too.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.120]   How do you break up any of these companies?
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:02.560]   This is one of the interesting things that has kind of happened in response, I would argue
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.600]   to the Microsoft stuff was that a lot of these companies started to form themselves.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.800]   I would definitely cite Facebook in this way.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:15.720]   Maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like they form themselves and have made themselves
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.400]   operate in a way that would be very difficult to extract.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.120]   Facebook is clearly doing that.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:25.400]   They just did this by creating a single sign-on for Messenger WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.760]   I would say, the messaging, they've done everything they can to easily say, "Yes."
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.120]   I think that if anything, in some cases, again, it really does come back to how feasible would
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.320]   this actually even be.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.560]   What does that even look like?
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:43.720]   Amazon, what's interesting to me is that they talked a lot about its dominance in e-commerce.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.480]   There was a section on cloud computing.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.960]   Obviously, it's on my Shireon and I will disclose I work at Microsoft, which is a competitor,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.800]   and I work in cloud, and I'm not trying to comment on any of that except to say that although
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:00.920]   there was an entire section on cloud computing, cloud computing wasn't the focus area of where
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.240]   they were looking at, wanting to break things up by dominance.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.560]   Most of their focus on the monopoly aspect was still around retail.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:15.520]   To me, that was interesting because if you look at a future of tech and where things
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.640]   are being invested, maybe that seems off.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   I don't know.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.720]   But again, it just indicates how would you separate these companies?
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.560]   How would you separate Google?
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.840]   I think that there's, for instance, you could easily say, "Well, we should never have let
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.760]   Facebook buy Instagram.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.640]   We should never have let Facebook buy WhatsApp."
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   Clearly...
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.640]   What's up, I think you could say Instagram.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   I don't think you could say that.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.840]   I think that Instagram, that was a billion dollars.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.000]   A lot of people criticized them at that time.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.080]   I thought it was brilliant when they did it.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.120]   But it was anti-competitive, right?
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   Their fear was the young people are moving to Instagram.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.960]   It was not a competitive, but I think that Instagram...
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.640]   They tried to buy Snapchat before they got Instagram because they were even more threatened
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   by Snapchat.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.360]   No, no, no, Snapchat didn't even exist then.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.360]   They bought Instagram and Instagram.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.360]   It was later.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.360]   Okay.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.360]   But they did try to buy Snapchat.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.360]   Was it anti-competitive or was it prescient and a...
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.360]   It was prescient.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.360]   It was prescient.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   It was prescient.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:17.400]   Because as I mentioned before, I just don't see Facebook as a platform.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:22.640]   I kind of see it go on the way of Friendster and other things that we've been long, fair
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.840]   well to in the rear view.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.840]   I wouldn't have noticed an agree.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.960]   I think WhatsApp, you could make the argument, right?
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.040]   WhatsApp was 47 and a half billion dollars or something by the time everything was said
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   and done.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.480]   WhatsApp was clearly a threat to messenger and was already an establishment of business
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.440]   and Facebook was already established enough at the time.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.120]   I think you could make an argument that maybe that should have had more scrutiny.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.640]   Instagram, I agree with Denise.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.640]   I think that was prescient.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.840]   That was them saying, "This is going to represent the next wave of social interaction.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.680]   Our own attempts at doing photos doesn't work.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:59.320]   We are going to buy this company that has 13 employees and spend a billion dollars on
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.200]   it and turn that into our future," which is what they've done.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.840]   That's an interesting thing.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.960]   Would Instagram have been as big a threat if they hadn't?
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.880]   This at least is a clear part of antitrust law, right?
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:20.480]   Denise, is this idea of you're not allowed to acquire competitors to reduce competition
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.480]   and consumer choice.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.440]   That's actually against the law.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.120]   Well, I mean, it depends on what your market position is.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.960]   You have to be big to do that, obviously.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.320]   I think it gets squishy in that regard.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.240]   Because Instagram just wasn't that good.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.280]   You weren't even on Android yet.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   Right.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   I was kind of there.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:45.160]   We come back around to this notion of unfair competition and the notion that they want to
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.720]   sort of revamp the antitrust laws.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:53.800]   Maybe it's that that Congress should do or maybe there should be sort of a national standard
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.960]   for unfair competition and more concrete definition as to what that is and what sort
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:04.520]   of practices, I mean, you could call them anti-competitive or not, but maybe they're
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.920]   just unethical when you're using the data that you have on party sellers.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   Is it legal to be unethical?
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   I wonder.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.440]   Phil, you've been trying to get a word in edgewise.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   You were there during this?
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:22.200]   I mean, when Instagram was bought by Facebook, I kind of remember that day I was talking
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.960]   to a lot of the principles as it was happening, about all the stuff.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.440]   I think what Instagram had, like what, 13 employees or 18 employees?
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.200]   Yeah, it was very small.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:41.800]   And yeah, I think to say that you make a startup, you grow to 13 people, you have your pre-revenue
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.920]   and you can't get acquired because of antitrust like that.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.920]   Right.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.160]   But now that they are that powerful does not that reduce.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   I'll give you.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.160]   Okay.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:59.880]   I think it's not unacceptable to say to Google, you need to divest YouTube because I think
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:07.400]   it tarnishes the search results that Google owns one of the biggest content creators on
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.000]   those search results.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.040]   I think you got to say, what are the problems that are the, like, what problems are these
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.040]   things causing?
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.640]   And what is the- Well, that's a problem.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.080]   That's why Google can compete with YouTube because, I mean, how are you going to compete?
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:28.080]   If Google owns YouTube, you can't compete because Google's just going to prefer YouTube
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.000]   results and you're gone.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.640]   But the answer to that wouldn't necessarily be to break them up, right?
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.600]   They could be broken up and then still just enter into an exclusive contract with YouTube
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.360]   and that also is illegal.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.600]   Well, exactly.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.640]   So there's like that activity could be regulated, right?
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.600]   You can say that a search engine can be able to favor.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.480]   Not necessarily their own, but any particular party.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:56.160]   Honestly, this is my pet peeve is that Google has so much power because if you're not on
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.680]   Google, you don't exist.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   They effectively are the gatekeeper to the whole internet.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:07.600]   And I think that as a result, Google search should be treated as a very special category.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.500]   And in a way, I think, I don't know what the answer, I don't know if there's any governmental
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.920]   solution to this, but Google search should almost, that should be a creature.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   I think that if you're putting up Google.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.920]   I think there's like real problems.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:19.920]   I mean, I have a couple of problems.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.920]   Sorry.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   Right.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   And I don't know that I thought that I completely buy the premise that you only get YouTube
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.440]   results on Google because they're favoring them.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.360]   You know, I get Vimeo results and see.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:38.160]   Yeah, but go ahead and search because you mostly get YouTube and Google's answers.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.640]   Well, that, but that's the best answer to that query.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.480]   And it's hard to deny that.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.480]   Exactly.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.760]   So I think this is like there's a very large number of things that I could hypothetically
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.960]   be upset about that are like hypothetical problems problems in the future.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.840]   Oh, well, maybe if they do this and they'll be really bad, if they do that.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:59.120]   And then there's like a small number of things that are actually terrible and actually happening.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.120]   And we don't have to guess about.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.520]   And I think it was like enough actually terrible things.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.840]   I'm just, I'm just much more animated by like the actual harm that's happening instead
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   of the hypothetical harm.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:14.560]   But you understand, I maybe do have a dog in this time because as a content creator,
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.800]   you know, I'm not going to my we're on YouTube for one reason.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.400]   So you can find us, right?
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   Right.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.800]   Well, we are on, you know, we make stuff and we are on everything.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.600]   And it's not clear to me that it would be easier if there was no YouTube.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.560]   You know, we're also put stuff up on Instagram and Twitter and everything else.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:34.000]   And there's a whole team that tries to figure out what to do for which.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.720]   I don't know that the world has ever been less friendly.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.640]   I mean, it's very more friendly to creators in terms of getting to people.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.720]   But you said at the very beginning and that's part of the, you know, that's the argument
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.600]   is we'll look how much we get from tech.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.800]   Yeah, it's working for that part of it.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:53.480]   So I just, I just don't, I can see the hypothetical abuses and I'm sure some of those abuses have
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.480]   been real.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   But I'm just less upset about that than the actual stuff that's happening.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   Right.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:05.480]   The sample I would throw in is Microsoft's acquisition Twitch, which was very robust.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.480]   Amazon.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.480]   Amazon.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   Sorry, Amazon.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   Microsoft bought mixer.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   You saw that one.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:15.760]   Yeah, that's not how the result.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   Yes.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.840]   The same same goal.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   Same goal.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.840]   Different result.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.440]   But buying a company and then not doing.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:32.600]   You're a tech news network that was all videos of tech news that was like Twitch.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.360]   You might be there instead of YouTube.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.360]   Right.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.360]   Right.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.360]   Christina, you've been trying to say something.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.120]   Yeah, all I was going to say is that I do feel like Google is, I mean, and I agree
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.800]   with Phil, like I think that there is something that's interesting to separate, which is,
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.480]   okay, when you look at some of the actual atrocities that Big Tech can create, like
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:52.800]   I think of the situation in Myanmar and the role that Facebook played with genocide,
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:58.360]   which is a massive problem and that to fill, and Indonesia's point, antitrust action's not
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360]   going to solve that, right?
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.040]   Like that's actually like a much bigger and much more difficult problem to look at.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.240]   But I do actually think that Google is interesting in that you can find like Yelp, you can find
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.840]   actual business cases, any of the travel companies where there has been like disproportionate
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.760]   impact on businesses when Google gets into those areas and the way they prioritize their
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:23.280]   own results and their own features over any of those competitors, regardless of like what
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.000]   might have the most accuracy or not.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.760]   Like I do feel like in that context, some of the anti-competitive stuff, Google probably
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.320]   has some good examples there.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.280]   I don't know about, I don't think I agree with the splitting of YouTube.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.000]   I think that that is a bigger conversation.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.760]   The number two search engine in the world is YouTube and I think that there's for a certain
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:50.480]   class of users, YouTube is their front end or Twitch or anything like that, like even
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.320]   Facebook, like is that's their front end to the Internet as much as Google is.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.440]   But I do feel like there are interesting things to look at such as with things like flight
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:04.360]   data where Google actually owns the company that provides almost all the flight data that
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:09.080]   every other company has to license and Google owns this and has their own competitive product.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:13.400]   The fact that the Google, the way that they're listing for different restaurants and other
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.640]   businesses will take precedence over those own restaurant or businesses websites or
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.440]   will take precedence over things from places like Yelp.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.400]   And they're shopping portal stuff where they prioritize their links and the companies that
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:35.320]   they have affiliations with over the number one online retailer Amazon, right?
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.440]   Like there are some interesting things I think you could say there that you could look at
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.000]   and look at trying to regulate in some ways.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.720]   Like I think that it would make sense maybe more than breaking things up to say, okay,
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:50.680]   there needs to be a Chinese wall that is part of the search product where the search product
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   is not able to--
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   That would be okay.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:57.600]   I'd be-- Deprioritize the Google products over other things which for many, many years
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.200]   was the case and that stuff being the case.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Yes, they merged--
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.800]   They did the same thing Facebook's doing right now.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.640]   They merged the accounts, right?
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.160]   So it's all one account, one Google account.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.360]   And all the information gathering happens from all the platforms.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   Exactly.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.720]   But in the old days, Google used to limit on their search pages how much the portion of
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.920]   the things would be their own stuff.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.880]   And at this point, if you Google something, sometimes the first page will just be various
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.880]   Google blocks.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:30.280]   And it's all done for the user's interest, but it's also done for Google's interest.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:35.680]   And maybe the solution is there should be some sort of, again, Chinese wall limiting
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.040]   some of that intervention.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:42.560]   But I don't know if having that solution requires splitting the company up.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.840]   And also to Phil's point, I don't know if splitting these companies up will necessarily
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:52.920]   like, I don't think that splitting up Facebook is going to end the atrocities that are happening
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:57.840]   because of disinformation being spread in propaganda campaigns being spread by foreign
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   governments.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.200]   What if Google tried to buy TikTok?
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.080]   Should that be allowed?
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.320]   I know Microsoft wanted to.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.200]   I don't think anybody was worried about that.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.000]   But should Google be allowed to buy TikTok?
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.880]   Wouldn't that be any competitive problem?
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.200]   I wouldn't have a problem with it.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.600]   But again, just I wouldn't know.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   I mean, I think like--
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.960]   People were Facebook, I think, yes.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.360]   But for Google, I don't know.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.480]   I mean, I don't think Google is a primarily social company.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.240]   Honestly, I think all of these things have a short shelf life and are really just based
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   on innovation.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:37.280]   It's always been the case, Phil, that nobody was an incumbent forever, that my space on
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.720]   the market until Facebook came along, that there's always been turnover.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:46.040]   Is it-- do you still believe that that's the law of technology or do you think that at
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:51.800]   some point, because of the network effect and incumbent can become so big, that it can't
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.960]   be unseated?
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.760]   Well, OK.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:01.520]   What is the difference between being acquired by Google and going public as a public who
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.520]   is a company?
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.240]   Like, which one of those is better for the world?
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.720]   Which one of them is less of a scam?
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   Right?
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.960]   They both have aspects of both of those things.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.880]   Well, what's the name of the going public?
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.160]   Well, I mean, IPO processes are quite scammy, right?
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.160]   OK.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160]   And available.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   OK.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.200]   But in principle, the notion that you have the public is investing and becomes part owner
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.080]   of your company, that's the principal.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.000]   Good, because now you have to be much more open about your financials.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Absolutely.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.680]   But in principle, the idea that you can start something and build it up and sell as a larger
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.080]   company is also a good idea.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.080]   Maybe.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:44.400]   If that larger company becomes like the big fish that keeps eating all the little fishes,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.600]   pretty soon you only have one fish.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:52.560]   But if they engage in behavior that actually hurts any aspect of the community, right,
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.720]   that actually hurts the larger world, which is the thing that I've ever looked at, for
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.760]   me, I can have three buckets for this.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:04.280]   I think there's companies who are actively designed to be harmful.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:07.680]   Like, I hope none of these are advertisements with you.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.080]   Like, let's say, deal dash.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.600]   Like, you see that on TV, right?
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.080]   Deal dash, obviously, needs to be illegal.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   People behind us should be there.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.880]   Are those the guys who sell, you say, you can get an iPad for $4.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.880]   Exactly.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.360]   And it's just straight up lying, right?
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.920]   Like, everything about it is just straight up lying.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.720]   It would be illegal in most countries.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.480]   And yeah, they're just like, it's purely exploitative.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.400]   It's just apparently it's legal in the United States.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   Nobody's stopping them.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.880]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.600]   It would be illegal in most other countries.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   Oh, illegal in most other countries.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.600]   Not here, yeah.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.760]   And there's a bunch of companies like that.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:41.280]   And those are just terrible places, terrible companies.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.000]   They specifically and intentionally exist to harm people.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.200]   I think you can make my case.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.640]   And again, I hope this is nobody's personal pet.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.400]   But Robin Hood, the investment market, is really designed to fleece young people.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.960]   So there's companies like that.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.680]   And there's a spectrum between how, like, deal dash.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.440]   Like, there's literally zero redeeming things.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.680]   It's just, it's just got on.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.200]   And I'm glad you say that.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   Because I see those ads and I wonder.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.080]   It sounds just like looking to a five minutes.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   It's just horrible.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   So that's like category A.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   Fucking one.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.160]   Category one is like, these are just companies that are just actively just trying to make
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.160]   a big deal.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.160]   They say they're the fair and honest bidding site.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.160]   I know.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.160]   I know.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.160]   It's amazing.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.160]   Right.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:30.320]   Category B are companies that aren't, they didn't set out to be horrible.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.600]   They were just drawn that way.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.680]   Like their business model just makes everything like kind of a structural conflict, right?
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.720]   And a lot of the big social media companies fall into that bucket right now.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:39.720]   Yes.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.720]   They may not even.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.200]   They're not trying to be.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.160]   In fact, they're trying to be good, I would guess.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.160]   They are.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.120]   And Twitter is actually doing, I think, heroic work to really like seriously try.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.600]   And a Google's goal of putting all the world's information at your fingertips.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.560]   That is a laudable goal.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.920]   That is a world changing goal.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.000]   And to some degree, they've done it.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.800]   Well, and there's, but there's aspects like take Google, for example, the Google search
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.160]   product is pretty well aligned.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:10.840]   Like Google search ads make money if you click on them, but you're likely to click on them
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.080]   because you're searching for the thing that the ads came out for.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.640]   So that's a high amount of intentionality.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.800]   So like there's actually not that many problems with Google search and it's more and
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.240]   most of their revenue comes from the problems come in with their indirect business model
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.000]   companies like YouTube, like YouTube's business model is they want you like riled up.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.160]   So you keep clicking on links.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.920]   And so they're just going to recommend things that are all up and you get the eco chain
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.880]   breed and get all of the social media stuff.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.040]   So even like something like Google, like it makes most of its money in search ads and
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.760]   a thing that isn't actually that terrible.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   It's pretty good.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.600]   There's hypothetical problems with it.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.720]   But for the most part, it's okay.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.120]   But then there's stuff like Facebook and YouTube and other things which are just like actively
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:52.360]   doing a lot of harm, not because they're bad people, unlike Dildash, we're just bad people.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.400]   Just because their business model makes it very hard not to do harm.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.280]   And so that's like bucket two.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.400]   And then there's bucket three, which is like the Google search stuff and Apple, where there's
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:06.720]   things that we can say are hypothetically going to be problematic if they act certain
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.200]   ways and we should put in the safeguards so they don't act in those ways.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.560]   But it's not really a big problem right now.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:18.880]   And I'd much rather see like regulators focusing on bucket one and bucket two, probably anti
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.120]   trust is not the answer to any of them.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.280]   The answer to bucket one is that those practices should be illegal.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.560]   The answer to bucket two is there ought to be like significant reform in the companies.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.680]   You know, maybe sometimes it's okay to break them up, but I'm not sure what that would
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.320]   achieve in these cases.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.760]   It's a let me let me ask the attorney.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:43.000]   Does antitrust law allow for the notion that something's potentially bad or does a bad
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.800]   act have to be committed?
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.200]   Is it enough to say that you have too much power?
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:53.600]   Again, I'm not an anti-trust lawyer, but my understanding is no, that you had your power
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.960]   alone is not going to be your problem.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.840]   Something bad has to happen before you can get into that.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:05.320]   And we've been talking about different shades of questionable acts versus when you see it,
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.760]   it's a bad act.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:13.560]   The thing that came up over and again for Microsoft over its 12 years was its tying
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.040]   of the browser to the operating system.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:20.120]   And people just looked at that and said, no, you can't do that.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.400]   You're the dominant operating system, this is the computer everybody uses.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.600]   If you're making it hard to get to another browser, that's just anti-competitive.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:34.360]   And so yes, it wasn't just being the dominant player that was the problem.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.040]   It was the deciding they were going to leverage that.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.440]   In malfeasance, you need to do something beautiful.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.440]   Yes, exactly.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:48.760]   And so, I mean, the thing that we just keep coming back around to is how do we limit bad
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.440]   corporate behavior?
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:58.000]   And there are certainly laws out there that ban bad corporate behavior, they can't commit
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.720]   fraud, they can't do false advertising, there's a whole myriad of things that will get a company
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.920]   in trouble.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:12.440]   But it's the little individual case of a decision that looks shady that tends to sort of fall
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:20.600]   under this lazy, fair, free market blanket that we adopt, and that's why you throw enough
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:25.640]   of those at the wall and eventually someone says, "Annotrust."
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:32.040]   And maybe what we need is more of a corporate governance.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:36.640]   I mean, we took such a handoff approach to the internet at the beginning so that these
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.920]   companies could rise to the levels that they've now achieved.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.080]   And maybe now it's time to just say, okay.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.680]   Now we need some guidelines.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:48.400]   We need some, we need a rule book for you guys to play by.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400]   Okay.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.440]   I should say, of course, that I don't actually know the deal dash people, and they may be
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   wonderful human beings.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.440]   Yes.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   Robin Hood is doing the God's work to make it possible.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.240]   Robin Hood actually know a bunch of them and actually like them a lot.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.920]   And I think Robin Hood is like a, I don't think they're revealed by design at all.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.280]   I think it's interesting to think through what the actions are, what consequences there
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.280]   were.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.280]   Right.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.280]   Deal dash, I don't know at all.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.560]   In my observation, it feels like it's just a really exploitative product.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.800]   Robin Hood, like, you know, this is like a so far is like a good example of that.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.800]   Right.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.960]   I actually know some of the sofait people that are doing a good human beings.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.960]   So far, right?
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.960]   Really good mission.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   Right.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.800]   They want to like make student debt much cheaper for people.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.200]   And they had this observation where, you know, if you're a computer science graduate
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.720]   from Stanford and you come out with a lot of student debt, like they could pay it off
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.120]   for you at a much cheaper rate because you're such a good credit risk because your future
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.280]   lifetime earnings are going to be great.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.000]   And you know, it's a really good product for people who fall into that category.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.800]   The unintended consequence is by removing those people from the pool of student debt
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.480]   are you making student debt more expensive for everyone else.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.800]   Not for your customers, they're doing anything wrong for their customers, but for the people
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.480]   who aren't their customers, they're making it worse.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.680]   And they might be, like I'm not sure, but they might be.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.800]   This is like saying, you know, Uber, like Uber has a responsibility to its drivers and
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.800]   to its riders.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.360]   Of course they do.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.400]   But they also have a responsibility for people who ride the bus.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.160]   And you know, if Uber's actions make life worse for people who can't afford Uber's in
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.760]   the first place, that's also a type of thing that they need to be responsible for.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.200]   So I think this is like, there's a lot of things here, but I, there are so many things
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:27.680]   that are clear to me that we ought to be focused on then what, you know, the antitrust and
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.680]   Facebook and Google, which I think is.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.600]   Give me one thing we should be focused on.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.240]   I know I can focus on it.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.760]   But like, I think the damage being done by the indirect business models, the ad supported
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.160]   micro targeted business models of social media and really a lot of media right now, I think,
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.360]   are very harmful to the world.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.000]   The problem is, the way you do advertising, the way you do advertising is like the only
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.280]   way that actually isn't bad for the world.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.960]   That's why we do it that way.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:03.320]   But the problem is, it's really hard to pass legislation on the first one.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.280]   So it's hard to know what to do about it.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.360]   And I think this is really the problem is that Congress, I don't think Congress, this is
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360]   a good parallel.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.080]   I don't think they're acting evenly.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.200]   I think they're trying to figure out how do we solve this problem.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.800]   But I think, as you pointed out, they have a hammer and maybe it takes more, maybe it
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.400]   takes a scalpel, maybe it takes more subtly.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.560]   Maybe there are other solutions.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.360]   This is a very difficult thing to solve.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.280]   In general, are you against the notion of government getting involved in this, Phil?
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.680]   No, no, no, no.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.720]   I'm very much not a libertarian, laissez-faire guy.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.280]   I like competent government.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.280]   I think the problem is our government lately does not have supercompens--
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.280]   I don't have it.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.040]   --very much would like it to be in that case.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.280]   Yeah, I'm happy to consider all sorts of smart regulations.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.360]   As long as there's a way to measure it, have a hypothesis about what this regulation is
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.040]   going to achieve, measure whether or not it's working or not, reverse it if it's not working.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040]   But we just don't do that.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040]   There's other countries that do.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.040]   We don't do that very well in the US.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040]   I'd agree with you.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.560]   Any final thoughts before we move on, Denise, anything to add to this?
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.080]   I think this is a really, actually, a very good discussion.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.160]   Is it an authority problem?
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.320]   It is a thorny problem.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:20.120]   And I guess my stay tuned is to see if Congress picks up the thread that they dropped down
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:26.400]   that maybe we'll revisit antitrust laws and see if we can refit them.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.400]   So watch for that.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.080]   Otherwise, I don't see much happening here in the near term.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.840]   That was toward the end of the report.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.280]   And I did read that carefully because they had some very clear-- I thought well-written
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:45.760]   recommendations for ways to perhaps amend our laws to make them more effective in this
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.760]   flight.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.280]   And maybe that would be the solution is to say, look, here's what we want to do.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.240]   And now you guys, we're going to be watching to make sure you do it.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.520]   I think the most positive thing for me out of that report was there was a section where
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.600]   they basically said that they think antitrust laws ought to encompass harm to not just consumers,
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.560]   but also employees, investors, just the rest of the world.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.560]   And I think that's key.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.400]   I think this to me is similar to something that happened, I think, last year, where
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.640]   a bunch of companies came out saying that they're not just looking for investors as shareholders.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.160]   They have a broader set of responsibilities.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.600]   They think this expansion of the circle of human beings to whom we have responsibility
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.400]   to not only include shareholders if you're a company and to not only include consumers
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.800]   if you're a government regulator, but to always include everybody else is like, that's
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800]   a very positive development.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:41.480]   And so I definitely-- I am encouraged by that, that our responsibility is always to everyone,
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:47.600]   not just to the people who are either our customers or our investors.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.200]   You know, I have to point out that Phil, I think you reflect the sentiment of Silicon
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.120]   Valley in general that the people in Silicon Valley are very smart.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.800]   The tech industry are very smart.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.280]   And I think as individuals, they all believe that.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:04.480]   They believe in trying to help forward the creator, greater good.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:09.000]   Some people are just in it for the money, but I think most of the really successful people
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.080]   are thinking that way, right?
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.080]   Is that your experience?
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.920]   I don't know if most of us are very smart.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.440]   You're a pretty bunch though, you can't deny that.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.440]   And he finally--
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.440]   I've been getting fine most.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.440]   Any final thoughts, Christina?
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:29.640]   No, I mean, I think as Denise pointed out, I mean, I think it'll be interesting to see
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.400]   if there is any change to the legislation and some of the rules around this stuff.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.920]   But as it stands, I mean, I think it's an interesting experiment.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.040]   It's a good document.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.280]   I still stand by what I said in the beginning, which is that I'm cynical.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:49.200]   And I don't actually see this at least in the short term having any impacts.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:55.040]   But I do think that potentially a good impact would be if this were to make big tech companies
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:01.120]   more considerate about the way that they do things, which is part of what happened with
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:08.520]   the Microsoft legislation or not legislation, but lawsuits.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.640]   Two decades ago, then that could be a net positive for everyone.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:18.600]   If even this experiment, even if it's just a paper tiger, makes big tech companies more
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:23.400]   considerate about what they're doing in the world as a whole, whether it relates to these
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.520]   specific areas or the broader, more important concerns that they'll mention, then that could
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.520]   be a good thing.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.640]   I completely agree with you.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.400]   And I think that might even have been the intent.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.000]   I mean, I was very impressed.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.440]   They spent 18 months.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.640]   They gathered a huge amount of information.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.040]   They had testimony from all the players.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.320]   And I thought there was a very thoughtful report.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.560]   And I wouldn't be surprised, Christine, if that really wasn't the intent, if they didn't
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.440]   know, look, there's no way we're going to break these companies up.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.800]   That's just not going to happen, not with our current legislative agenda.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.840]   But we should at least make these points.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840]   And maybe they will.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:08:02.840]   And it's clear that Tim Cook and Sundar Pachai and Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos kind of
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.200]   didn't hear what they said.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.760]   And are kind of paying attention.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.800]   If that's the upshot of this, that's a good thing.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.800]   They're paying attention.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   I guess.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.800]   Go ahead.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:20.280]   Oh, just before we lose the thread altogether, we touched on this whole notion that the Republicans
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:25.280]   wanted this to be much more about whether conservative viewpoints were being discriminated
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.280]   against.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:31.480]   And we haven't really discussed the role that that plays in any sort of antitrust analysis.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.680]   Obviously zero, right?
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.600]   Actually, we could spend a lot of time, maybe we will later in the show on Section 230 because
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.600]   it continues to be under assault.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:48.920]   And that is a very important basis for everything that happens in the internet, including everything
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.920]   we do here.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:55.680]   And boy, it always makes me nervous when I, and even Joe Biden said, yeah, I think we
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.920]   should really reconsider Section 230.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:03.620]   President Trump is currently saying we should eliminate 230 under the guise of this.
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.860]   That's exactly the opposite of what he thinks, apparently, because it would in fact make
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:13.980]   it very easy to censor, consider to thought, but okay, we're not going to talk about that.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.740]   We will a little later, but later on, I want to mention our sponsor.
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:19.740]   In fact, we're breathing clean air in here.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.740]   Thank goodness.
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.340]   Thanks to our molecule.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.140]   We're all spending a lot more time indoors.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.980]   And if you're unlucky enough to be in an area where the forest fires, the wildfires have
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:35.260]   been raging, you know that the indoor air as bad as it is is better than the outdoor air.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:39.500]   Actually indoor air, according to the EPA, can be five times worse than good outdoor
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.700]   air.
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.220]   And so it's really important that you do what you can to make sure the air you're breathing
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.620]   inside is clean.
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.980]   That's why we use molecule.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:52.180]   It's not just an innovation on existing technology.
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.620]   It's not really a filter.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:56.140]   It has filtration, but it's actually more than that.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.180]   It's a scientific breakthrough in air purification.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:06.660]   They use a very interesting technology called PICO, photo electrochemical oxidation.
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:12.220]   It traps harmful pollutants, even particles too small to be trapped by filters and then
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.020]   destroys them.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:18.220]   Particles like virus, bacteria, mold, and chemicals.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.740]   It's not collecting them.
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.500]   It literally destroys them with light.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:27.260]   All air purifiers are designed to protect homes, businesses, even medical spaces.
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.420]   You know they're destroying pollutants and providing clean air.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:34.860]   There are a variety of molecules you can choose from at the molecule website.
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.380]   Some are designed for large rooms.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.700]   That's the one we've got in here up to 600 square feet.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:44.380]   There's a newer, smaller one, the molecule air mini.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.820]   That's for a bedroom or a smaller room, 250 square feet.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:53.020]   There's the mini plus, which has a particle sensor and auto protect mode that adjusts
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.660]   the fan speed based on the sensor.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:59.540]   If you're in a medical office, you ought to know about the Molecule Air Pro RX.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:05.780]   This is FDA cleared as a 510K Class II medical device for medical purposes to destroy bacteria
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.460]   and viruses in the air.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:14.380]   Many of us live inside these days when the air is bad outside.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.940]   So clean indoor air is more important than ever.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.820]   That's why we have a molecule in the studio.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.980]   We've got one, another one for the house.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:26.700]   Molecules Pico technology meets the performance requirements in the FDA guidance for use in
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:32.580]   helping reduce the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.220]   Now we didn't buy the molecule for that, but boy it's kind of nice to know it works
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.860]   in healthcare settings.
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:44.020]   By the way, as you see on the website, there's a big research tab.
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:50.220]   We've made the research from DOE labs like the Lawrence Berkeley Labs.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:55.460]   Molecule Air Pure Fire and independent testing was shown to reduce concentrations of a proxy
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:59.180]   virus they used to stand in for COVID-19.
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:02.020]   Wouldn't be safe to test it on COVID, obviously.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:04.140]   So they used this MS-2.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:12.980]   The labs showed that concentrations of MS-2 were reduced by almost 100%, 99.9% in an hour.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:16.380]   So of course you're still going to do all the other things like wear masks and wash your
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:21.220]   hands in social distance, but it is a very nice feeling to know there's an extra layer
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:24.300]   of virus protection in your spaces.
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.300]   Molecules, technology and filtration systems have been tested and verified by independent
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:32.980]   third-party labs for the whole home and beyond.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:37.220]   Molecule now offers its breakthrough Pico technology across a range of products, providing
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.020]   a clean air solution for a range of environments.

[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:50.340]   to protect your entire home office, medical or dental practice or business against pollutants.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:54.100]   I want the people who come to work here are pretty important to me.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:57.180]   So we want to make sure they're breathing clean air, safe air.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.940]   That's why we use the Molecule here in the studio.

[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.420]   I'm breathing easier.
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.420]   Thanks to you.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.380]   It was really a big deal.
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.620]   We got so smoky outside, it started to smell smoky inside.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:34.340]   Thank goodness we were able to clear the air out here and I can breathe.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.220]   There was just one more thing 2020 brought us.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:38.980]   Wildfires, thank you.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.500]   Thank you so very much.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.180]   I've got a couple of Molecule filters going here.
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.180]   Do you?
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.180]   Good.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.180]   Are you at work or at home?
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:48.180]   I'm at home.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:52.620]   I had one at home and then we had three at the office and then I bought one of the ones
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:55.140]   from the office when we shut down our office.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.740]   So now I have two here.
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:58.740]   Great.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.540]   Yeah, I mean we can't open windows here.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:06.540]   And I actually talked to the HVAC contractors because I want to make sure that we were getting
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:11.860]   fresh air mixed in because you don't want to recirculate bad air.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:15.540]   But then now I'm saying, oh, but maybe we should have so much fresh air.
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.540]   It's just a mess.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.540]   You just can't win.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:22.300]   One way or the other, thank goodness for the Molecules.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:29.540]   I don't know and this is, I'm glad we have my counselor here, our attorney's Denise because
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.820]   I don't know exactly how to read.
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:36.740]   Did you read the oral arguments in the Oracle versus Google on Wednesday?
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:43.460]   Well, I listened to a lot of the audio, which is very cool that we have access to that.
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:44.460]   Is it already up?
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.660]   Is it on OIA or is it on C-SPAN?
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:47.660]   Where was it?
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.660]   C-SPAN, yeah.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.660]   Oh, C-SPAN, yeah.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:55.980]   As in the coronavirus, the court is now releasing audio in a much more expeditious way.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.980]   Yes.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.380]   Yes, plus there are transcripts out there of it.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.940]   So I did not listen to the audio, but I read a little bit of the transcripts.
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:07.700]   The issue, at issue, is a fairly important issue for the tech industry.
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:14.420]   Whether Oracle can copyright its Java APIs or whether Google could use them as a fair
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:20.180]   use defense, that's Google's defense, and they, of course, use them in the creation of
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:27.980]   Android rewriting the code in a clean room environment, just duplicating the API.
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:32.420]   That is really important to how the internet works.
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:36.420]   But the consensus seemed to be, and I've had experience in the past listening to oral
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:41.700]   arguments or reading transcripts where you can't necessarily say which way the court's
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:45.340]   going to go based on what the justices ask.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:50.940]   But ours, Technica, for instance, among others, Timothy Lee writing, "Google's Supreme Court
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:56.060]   face off with Oracle was a disaster for Google."
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.460]   Do you agree, Denise, from what you read?
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:04.780]   I tend to be in the camp that you mentioned a moment ago, and that's that it's really
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:07.300]   hard to read the court based on the questions that are asked.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:12.260]   I mean, you can kind of get a feel for where the justices are going, but sometimes they're
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:17.220]   very strategic about the questions that they're asking, and they've made up their mind, but
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:22.020]   they're trying to flesh out points for members of the court that they know are undecided.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:28.980]   So there's a lot of stuff that goes on in that courtroom that's sort of under the surface,
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:32.740]   and it's hard to just say, "Oh, Justice Alito didn't seem to like that at all."
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:37.500]   I mean, you might have another agenda going on.
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.940]   It's really tough to say.
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:43.580]   We won't know for months what the court decides.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.140]   Yeah, it could be a few months.
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.140]   A lot of spring.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:52.980]   Yeah, I mean, this is another thing I talked about, Microsoft being in litigation under
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.580]   investigation for 12 years.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.900]   This case has gone on for 10.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:04.700]   Yeah, it's and when you wind it back down to the trial court level, Google actually won.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:08.980]   And that's where the court could go with this.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.100]   There are two big issues.
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.420]   It's whether APIs are copyrightable.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:19.700]   Google says no oracle says yes, and that's really the crux of that part of the case.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:27.140]   But assuming they are copyrightable, Google won on fair use, which is a factual jury issue
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:32.820]   that got undone at the appellate court level, which is really, really unusual.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:37.820]   So the court could just kick it back down to the trial court, make them start all over
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:41.820]   from square one, even though they had trial 10 years ago, and say, "Okay, you're going
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:49.740]   to have to retry this fair use issue because that's where we're going with this."
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:57.140]   It's worth reading the Wikipedia article on this because it is such a tangled, long,
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.540]   and back and forth thing.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:02.940]   It's been to the Supreme Court before, and they kicked it back down to the lower court
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.300]   over this fair use thing.
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.300]   It is kind of an amazing story.
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:11.420]   Let me ask Phil, though, because you have good standing to talk about how important is
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:17.860]   it that APIs can be copied in software.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.980]   What would an adverse decision for Google mean to the software industry?
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.740]   Would it really be bad news?
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:28.700]   You're muted, I think, Phil.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:38.380]   I think the way this works is the most influential book that I've ever read is The Clock of the
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.380]   Long Now.
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.380]   It's by Stewart Brand.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:43.740]   He's got one chapter, chapter seven.
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:49.060]   In fact, there's one page in chapter seven, one diagram that is the most important thing
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.300]   I've ever read about anything.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:53.100]   It's called The Order of Civilization.
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:59.580]   It basically shows these seven concentric circles of how the world spins.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:06.180]   Its main point is that government and commerce are supposed to spin at different speeds, and
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.340]   it's supposed to feel frustrating.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.340]   These people are supposed to feel that government is way too slow and not useful.
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:17.700]   If they don't feel that, then you're living in a much worse society.
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:22.180]   I think this case really shows that.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:27.420]   I think part of what that means is court cases are almost never resolved in time.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.740]   Important ones are almost never resolved in time where the decision is actually relevant
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.700]   to any of the companies that are part of the suit.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:42.300]   They're at best internalized deep learning that we apply in the future going forward.
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.900]   I think the discussion around this, the fact that it's taken so long, just like with a
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:50.460]   Microsoft case, that's the important part.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.860]   I don't know that if that decision had gone one way or the other, it would have actually
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:20:00.980]   had that big of a difference to either Google or Oracle right now, but the fact that the
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:06.260]   whole thing happened and took 10 years or however long it's been and caused the discussion
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:10.020]   about what is desirable for APIs.
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.940]   That's shaped the world in an important way.
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:19.020]   To me, this is like Stuart's brand's seven layer diagram in action where it was anticlimactic.
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:22.260]   It almost didn't matter which way the decision happened to go.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.900]   The actual lessons were already learned and internalized from it.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:30.180]   Those lessons are that APIs are super critical for the functioning of the world and there
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:35.180]   need to be more of them and not fewer of them and they need to be as open as possible.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:45.740]   I think back to when IBM created the first PC, in order to create a PC compatible, I think
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.740]   it was Compaq.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:47.740]   It was Compaq.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:53.020]   Yeah, they sent some engineers into a sealed room and they said, "You may not look at the
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:58.780]   BIOS code that IBM is shipping, but here are the things, here are the calls and here
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:20:59.780]   are the responses.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:03.620]   Here's what a compatible BIOS would need to do."
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:10.820]   They were able to reverse engineer the IBM BIOS and start making compatible computers.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:13.420]   Because of that, the PC revolution happened.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:18.420]   It was important to be no point in Halton catch fire.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.420]   Yes, that's right.
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:20.420]   It sure was.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.740]   Although it's important to note there are two things.
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:26.420]   One, and obviously I'm not the lawyer so I'll defer to Denise here, but one, I believe
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:29.620]   that if there was anything that would have happened from IBM's side, that would have
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.460]   been a patent thing and not a copyright thing.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:38.940]   The second thing is that that was reverse engineering where there wasn't a reverse engineering.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:48.700]   This was just strictly reusing the Java SDK, reverse beta when creating Android.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.460]   It wasn't a reverse engineering situation at all.
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:56.420]   It was in fact there had been discussions and I think that this is where some of the questions
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:00.860]   went into and certainly what parts of the litigation were about and the multiple trials
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:02.100]   that have happened over this.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:06.500]   There had been discussions between Sun and Google over how they would partner or not
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.420]   partner over the use of this.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:17.300]   Google didn't want to be an official signee to having licensed access to Java's for mobile,
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.300]   whatever it was called.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.300]   I can't remember now.
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:25.060]   I wanted to create their own implementation, but they used the same API so that applications
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:30.220]   that were already written could run either without any modifications or with very limited
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:36.060]   modifications in addition to being able to go to existing developers and say, "Hey, you
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:42.780]   can use a language that you already know to develop applications for our platform."
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:48.540]   If you are going to try and read the tea leaves from the argument, it does seem like if you're
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:52.780]   going to take the questions at face value, that a lot of the justices had a hard time
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:23:00.180]   making the distinction between declaring code, which is a real fascinating way of putting
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:06.020]   things, and a method and process that would not be subject to copyright.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:12.700]   Trying to decide what an API is depends on what you decide, whether you decide it falls
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.740]   into one of those buckets.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:20.740]   One of the things that Timothy B. Lee points out in his Ars Technica article quite correctly
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:28.980]   is Google hired one of the most famous, most renowned Supreme Court advocates who has ever
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:35.380]   lived, Tom Goldstein, but he maybe wasn't the right guy for this job because they needed
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:39.140]   to get that explanation and they needed to get it clearly, and it doesn't seem like they
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:40.660]   were really getting it.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:45.460]   Justice Kavanaugh asked an interesting question.
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:52.060]   This is over that idea that you're not copying the code, you're copying the API.
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:56.220]   He said, "Well, but you're not allowed to copy a song just because it's the only way
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.060]   to copy a song.
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:00.900]   Why is that principle not a play here?
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:04.180]   Does that show a lack of understanding?"
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.260]   I think so.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:10.580]   I think so because the really way you should look at it is that, "Okay, if you were to
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:12.780]   copy a song for Batum, that is one thing.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:15.140]   If you were to copy a program for Batum, that's one thing."
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.100]   The API is really the notes.
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:25.140]   I personally do think that it was a misunderstanding, although by the same token, I don't think
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:30.980]   that it's in any way reasonable for us to expect the jurists to have a full understanding
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:31.980]   of all these things.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.940]   I think that's what the lawyers should do, but I did want to-
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:38.540]   Remember, Judge Alsop famously learned how to write a sort routine in Java.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.220]   That's exactly what I was going to point out.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:44.180]   I actually think that's what's really interesting about this is that when you look at the lower
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:48.060]   court decision, and when you look at the initial decision, which Judge Alsop did, he
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:53.460]   actually took on upon himself, he learned Java, and he spent a significant amount of
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:57.140]   time really going above and beyond to get these things right.
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:25:01.780]   Those obviously were not things that then the appeals court took into consideration, and
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:06.260]   these aren't things that we can expect or should expect the high court to do.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:11.660]   But him doing that, I do really think, is commendable on lots of levels because he really went
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.700]   above and beyond to understand the issues.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:18.180]   But to Timothy Lee's point, and to just say what Denise said, based on my listening to
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:26.180]   the hearing, it really did strike me as thinking, "I don't know if you have the right guy for
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:27.180]   this.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:30.540]   You had a really experienced lawyer, but I don't know if you had the right guy for this because
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:37.660]   this is, frankly, not just a very technical argument, but it's also really tricky on
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.020]   their technical multiple ways.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:43.660]   It's technical from the actual level, but it's also like there are a lot of technicalities
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:45.260]   about what you're trying to express.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:48.740]   >> Yeah, Lee said he should have used some colorful analogies.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:56.980]   >> Right, because, yeah, I think it was Breyer who brought up the QWERTY example, which
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:05.260]   is a good one to bring up, and that did kind of, but it's like your lawyer should be breaking
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:09.260]   this down and making the better analogies the more colorful things, or at least being
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:13.820]   able to fight back when the justices are trying to kind of come up with their own analogies
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.700]   to explain why that is different.
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:21.740]   And to me, and I could be wrong here, but I hear the musical analogy and I'm thinking
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:26.420]   that's assuming there's only one way to write a song, which is untrue, but it's also confusing
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.980]   the notes and music with the product that comes from those notes.
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.620]   >> Yeah, Justice Thomas clearly didn't understand it.
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:38.460]   He compared Google's actions to a football team taking a rival's playbook.
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.460]   >> Right.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.460]   >> Yeah.
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:45.900]   >> Gorsuch said this is really odd.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:49.420]   Other companies have been able to come up with phones that work just fine without engaging
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.420]   in this kind of copying.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.420]   >> Right, because they had their own languages.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.420]   >> Yeah.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:59.700]   >> I mean, I think that what they don't understand is how important APIs are to interoperability.
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:05.380]   That's how, that's the agreed upon way companies interoperate.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:08.740]   >> How important interoperability is to everything.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:09.740]   >> Everything.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:10.740]   >> Right, yeah.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.740]   >> And this is the lesson from- >> Including to Oracle.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:13.740]   >> Right.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:19.260]   >> Yeah, by the way, Oracle uses Amazon's S3 API so that they're S3 compatible.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.220]   >> I mean, you even argue, I saw this a lot of places like that they're using, you know,
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.220]   IBM SQL, you know, to create- >> Right.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.220]   >> Blackship.
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:27.220]   >> Right.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:28.220]   >> To program.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.220]   >> It was based on SQL.
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.220]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.060]   >> I mean, because really, I think this is fundamentally, and this wasn't really the question before
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.700]   the court, but really, I think what this whole case has been about, it's been about a licensing
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:36.700]   thing.
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:41.900]   It's been about the fact that Google didn't initially pay to be part of the licensing process and
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:44.700]   then didn't settle, which frankly, I think they should have.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.180]   >> Well, now they might- >> Exactly.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.340]   >> Now they might think, yeah.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.340]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:51.660]   >> Well, I mean, hopefully, I mean, I don't know, personally, my best case scenario here
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:55.100]   just have been heard it, and I agree with Denise, I mean, you know, you can't judge based
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:59.380]   on just the questions they ask, but given, like, what could potentially be on the line
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:05.020]   here, I hope they punt, and they just, like, you know, bump it down to, you know, either
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:13.340]   affirming or rejecting the lower court's opinion, but don't make any decisions on, like, the actual
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:20.140]   questions, because if the response were instead basically say that, you know, you can copy
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.460]   your API's, I don't think that's a good thing.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.260]   I don't think that's a good thing for the industry at all.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:30.740]   >> Yeah, and I actually think it could be really interesting against the backdrop of the antitrust
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:37.780]   discussion we just had that Congress may look at the outcome of this case and see this as
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:46.620]   a way that companies can tie up their goods and, well, I was going to use the word "extort,"
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:53.540]   but that's not really accurate, demand large license fees for things that otherwise might
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:58.580]   be freely available had the court just made a different legal call.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:03.660]   >> Phil, what do you think?
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:09.340]   >> So I think there's a difference here between what I want the world to be like and how the
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:15.460]   law is written and how to, you know, how to, like, bend the current issues into the current
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:16.460]   law.
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:21.460]   I'm very clear that, like, APIs ought to be interoperable.
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:25.420]   Things should not be forced to be different just for the sake of being different.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:31.500]   That regardless of how this decision goes, it's like, the realistic worst-case scenario
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:36.900]   is that it just adds additional complexity, because now you just need to have more translation
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.300]   layers between APIs and you'll have to make them different just for the sake of getting
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.860]   around this law and all of that is going to get automated anyway, so it won't have a
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:47.940]   practical effect other than, you know, there'll be, like, an extra layer of things to introduce
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:51.820]   bugs and complexity in some, you know, in some expense.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:57.420]   I think the important thing is that there is more interoperability rather than less than
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:00.100]   that APIs are crucial to the world working.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:04.420]   They think, like, people learn that from this case, but that's not the role of the court,
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.420]   right?
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:07.060]   The court is not trying to say, like, which way should the world go?
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.140]   They're theoretically saying, well, what does the law say?
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.140]   >> Right.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.140]   >> Do we apply this law to the current thing?
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:16.260]   And they're like, I just don't know, and honestly, it's not that important to me.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:20.020]   I think regardless of which way this decision goes, yeah, there'll be some additional money
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:24.340]   that'll pass hands between lawyers on one side and lawyers on the other side, and then
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:27.140]   the industry already knows what the answer is, which is more interoperability and not
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:32.540]   less, and, yeah, we may be, if it goes the wrong way, then maybe there's, you know, maybe
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:36.820]   there's just a little bit of extra layers and some more bugs and some more expense in
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:40.700]   getting things to work together, which would be unfortunate, but I don't think it's going
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:44.860]   to reverse this trend towards more inter-unertivity.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:48.940]   And then what effect it has on things like, you know, copyrights, form music and stuff
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:56.500]   like that is also like, you know, I don't know, and I don't think it's going to affect, you
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.100]   know, more than just the lawyers.
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:02.580]   It'll just be yet another full employment back to the lawyers and all sides of this.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.820]   >> Very sensible response, actually, because everybody else says the sky is falling.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:11.700]   >> Right, and the other way and the point I was trying to make by talking about what
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:17.380]   Congress might do with this and how it might view it is it might encourage Congress to
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:22.460]   view this as, oh, well, here are large companies getting even more power.
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:29.660]   Maybe this gives us even more incentive to start addressing how we can revamp antitrust
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:34.660]   law, even though we're talking about copyright here, the market effect is similar.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.540]   >> Yeah. Well, I hope you're right.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:44.580]   >> But in other words, the Congress would be the next level of review.
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:45.740]   >> That's an important point, though.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:49.020]   >> Like what the court has done, Congress can write new law.
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.020]   >> Can change.
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:51.020]   >> Yeah.
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:54.260]   >> It's such an important point because I think people sometimes say, well, this is a Supreme
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.740]   Court's rule, it's over, it's done.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:56.820]   But no, of course not.
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:59.580]   That's just the Supreme Court's interpretation of standing law.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.060]   You can change the law.
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:02.060]   >> Yes.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.980]   >> And that's what Congress does.
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:04.980]   >> Yes.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.700]   >> Copyright law wasn't written for software, let alone for APIs.
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.980]   And so, of course, it's going to be a weird, broken fit.
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:13.900]   So yeah, maybe it's a good time to rethink how we want things to be.
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:15.900]   >> Okay.
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.180]   I'm behind that one.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:18.580]   I'm behind that one.
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:19.900]   Let's take a little time out.
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.100]   We have a short video about the fun times we had.
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:25.180]   I like to look back.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.180]   I'm nostalgic about this week earlier on Twitter.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.620]   God, I feel terrible.
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.540]   I've been keeping Steve Martin on hold.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.740]   It's good to talk to you, Steve.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:34.260]   >> Is it up to you?
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:40.340]   Was that a concert where I had to range tickets for you to come see Martin Short and my --
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:42.940]   >> You're never going to let this go, are you?
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:44.940]   >> That was like five years ago.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:45.940]   >> On Twitter.
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:46.940]   >> You felt so bad about it.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:47.940]   >> Hands on iOS.
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:53.300]   Coming up on Hands on iOS, I am going to show you a fun, new feature you can take advantage
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:59.580]   of and iOS 14 can just simply double tap on the back of the phone and voila, it took
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.380]   a screenshot.
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:08.180]   >> What better way to celebrate security must by planning some attacks and defending?
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.740]   >> I think the perimeter is dead at this point in time and we all agree on that.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.260]   It's like the year we're going to know something.
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:14.260]   >> No, you're going to the home.
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:15.260]   There's no perimeter.
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:16.260]   >> Exactly.
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:17.260]   It's wide open.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:20.500]   This was a unique opportunity for hackers to do damage.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:21.860]   >> All about Android.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.140]   >> This is the Google TV with Chromecast.
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.980]   I really prefer this sort of caveman way of using an IR remote.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:33.180]   This is a great way that Google is going to compete directly with the Apple TVs and Roku's.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:37.140]   >> Tech News Weekly, Google Home 2020, also known as Nest Audio.
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:40.540]   >> It's covered in fabric like most of the other Google products released in the last
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.260]   couple of years.
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:47.700]   Could this be used with a Chromecast with Google TV as dedicated wireless speakers next to
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.700]   your television?
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:50.780]   The answer unfortunately is no.
[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:53.380]   You can't use it like that.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:55.340]   This is only a Chromecast.
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:56.340]   >> Twitter.
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:58.140]   >> I see you touching your face, Leo.
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:59.140]   >> I was.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.140]   How did Jim?
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:02.580]   How did you see that?
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:06.980]   He caught me.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:12.220]   That was by the way a great event we had on Thursday, the attack and defense event.
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:14.380]   It's available at twitter.tv/events.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.500]   It's the number nine event.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.820]   Bruce Schneider, guru of security.
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:22.220]   Jerry Bokeld, who's the CISO at LogMean.
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:26.980]   Brian Chee Chebert from this weekend Enterprise Tech and our favorite hacker, the digital
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:29.460]   Jesuit, Father Robert Ballisaire.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:37.900]   He has decided a level 40 chaotic cleric because he caused some trouble.
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:42.020]   I think we all learned an awful lot from that hour long special event.
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:45.500]   Thank you, LastPass, for sponsoring that and letting us put that together.
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:49.900]   That was a lot of fun for cyber security month.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:57.340]   I'll show you today brought to you by World Wide Technology, talking about cyber security.
[01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:02.980]   World Wide Tech and CISCO, WWT offers you security solutions and services to protect
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:04.660]   your business.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:09.220]   My question for you, it's a question I ask Russell all the time, our IT guy.
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.740]   How prepared are you?
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:14.340]   Attackers are constantly updating their strategy.
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:16.260]   I learned so much on Thursday.
[01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:18.220]   Oh my God, I'm terrified.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.220]   What I have you?
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.220]   Are you prepared?
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:23.900]   WWT can help you prepare to combat.
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:28.900]   Next Gen Threats, your team provides resources and the platforms to make it possible.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:32.620]   They've been doing it for over two decades.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:34.180]   They've got the track record.
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:35.180]   We were so impressed.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:37.900]   Lisa and I flew out to St. Louis to visit WWT.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.700]   Beck and March was our last trip before quarantine.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:49.540]   I was just blown away by WWT's commitment to systems, to how things work, to understanding.
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:54.260]   They built that amazing advanced technology center, half a billion dollars worth of enterprise
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.940]   gear so they can test.
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.900]   They can roll out proofs of concept for their customers.
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:35:59.900]   They're amazing.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:04.580]   WWT worked with a large healthcare organization to conduct a security risk assessment of their
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:07.780]   certified electronic health record technology.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:12.580]   A lot of health organizations are trying to do, but boy, you've got to be really careful.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:17.700]   WWT's consultants use their expert knowledge, state of the art tools, in-depth analysis,
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:21.660]   skilled training and repetition to complete their assessment.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:26.180]   You'll actually be glad to know that 90% of the vulnerabilities they've found at this
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:33.220]   healthcare organization could easily be fixed by putting in a comprehensive systematic approach
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.740]   for patching.
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:35.740]   It was that simple.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:37.740]   That's the kind of thing you need to know.
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:40.260]   I think a lot of companies just hide their head in the sand and say, "I'm sure we're
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:41.420]   doing the right thing."
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:42.700]   You need to go to WWT.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:46.380]   They worked with a big retail bank to help them achieve their primary goal of establishing
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:51.460]   an infrastructure that could prevent, and if they couldn't prevent, survive a catastrophic
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:53.940]   cyber security event.
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:58.460]   WWT helped them reduce system outages by 40%.
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:00.100]   By the way, saved the money.
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:04.900]   Ongoing cost savings of 48% through infrastructure automation.
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:10.780]   Whether it's endpoint security, network security, identity and access management, or creating
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:16.420]   the latest zero trust architecture, which is what we talked a lot about on Thursday,
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:19.060]   the idea that there is no perimeter.
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:22.900]   Assume that everybody could be malicious.
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.460]   You could build a next generation security architecture based on strong identity management
[01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:28.660]   encryption and segmentation.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.700]   This is what you need to thwart the most advanced attacks.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:36.260]   No matter what business you're in, security has to be job one.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:41.020]   See how WWT can protect your business assets and intellectual property with a holistic
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:42.700]   security approach.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:46.740]   And of course, they partner with Cisco to give you the best tools to get it done.
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:50.140]   Go to www.wt.com/twit to get started.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:53.540]   Let worldwide technology help you.
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.140]   www.wt.com/twit.
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:03.260]   WWT delivering digital outcomes and modernizing IT infrastructure all over the world.
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.220]   They're really a great group of people.
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.660]   I'm really proud to be partnered with them now.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:12.140]   This is a good year for us, the two of us together.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:18.940]   They were much needed all over the enterprise.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:19.940]   Let's see.
[01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:22.140]   John McAfee in jail.
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:26.140]   Oh my God.
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:27.940]   It happened to a nicer guy.
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:28.940]   What a story.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:33.900]   The DOJ indicted him for tax evasion of all things.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:38.180]   That's what they got Al Capone for too.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:39.180]   Who owns it, McAfee?
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.620]   Is it IBM now?
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:52.060]   The company that owns McAfee antivirus was quick to say we have nothing to do with him.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:39:03.940]   The SEC filing with 55 pages, apparently McAfee was promoting fraudulent ICOs.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:07.980]   Those are internet coin offerings.
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:09.900]   Initial coin offerings.
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:16.180]   It's like an IPO but with a C instead of a P. Initial coin offerings using basically cryptocurrency
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.820]   to fund offerings.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:23.500]   In his defense, it's not clear what a non-fraudulent ICO is.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.140]   It's a strudu.
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:29.340]   It's like deal 1/2 percent accurate though.
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.180]   Excellent point.
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:32.500]   Those aren't around anymore.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.660]   People have learned their lesson.
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:34.660]   I would hope.
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:38.180]   This was in 2017 and 2018.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:47.300]   He promoted seven different ICOs and apparently received $11.5 million worth of promoted tokens
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:48.300]   as a result.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.940]   It's just cashed out, man.
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:55.180]   Yeah, when you get that Bitcoin, don't put it in a wallet and forget the password.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.180]   I'm just saying.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.180]   Yes, this is true.
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.660]   You've been through that.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:02.220]   I'm just saying.
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:05.700]   Turn it into greenbacks as quickly as you can.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:09.380]   Why does sell mine because of potential conflict of interest?
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:13.140]   Then I never even wrote about it again.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:15.380]   Microsoft didn't want you to own it.
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:16.380]   It's not Microsoft.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:17.380]   This was not Microsoft.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:18.380]   This was Mashable.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.100]   This is going way, way back.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:25.060]   I wrote something in 2012 about an explainer about Bitcoin.
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:28.540]   This means you sold it at nothing for nothing.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:31.460]   No, I sold it for a little more than that.
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:33.780]   I bought in at $10 a coin.
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.540]   How much did you have?
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:37.020]   I had 15 coins.
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.940]   You'd be a millionaire today.
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:42.420]   I'd be much better off.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:46.300]   No, I had to sell for like $200 a coin or something.
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:50.140]   I did well, but it was not like what it would have been at all.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:53.140]   What's 15 times $11,375?
[01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:56.380]   It's over a million dollars.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:58.380]   It's over $100,000.
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.380]   It's not only a thousand.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:02.380]   At one point it was $20,000.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:04.100]   It could have been $600,000.
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.660]   Yes, $600,000.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:06.660]   At one point.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:09.260]   I wouldn't be in a closet as someone in IRC pointed out.
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.260]   That is correct.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:12.780]   It would be a much nicer closet.
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:14.260]   It would be a much nicer closet.
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.700]   It would be like the closet of my dreams.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:19.220]   It would be like Paris Hilton's closet.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:23.300]   Dana Carvey once said, "The only thing about getting rich is you have a nicer bedroom to
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:26.540]   watch TV."
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.540]   It's like that.
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:29.180]   You'd have a nicer closet to do your pockets.
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:33.500]   I do have to say though, that at least, I think that you, like locking yours in your
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.500]   wallet is the worst.
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:36.500]   I have seven.
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.500]   I still own them.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:40.500]   I can't get to them.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.180]   There's no way.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:43.700]   I gave them to Florence Ion.
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:44.700]   That's right.
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:45.700]   I don't have any more Florence.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:46.700]   I gave them to them.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:47.700]   He said, "Here's the wallet.
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:48.700]   Do what you will."
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:49.700]   Do what you will.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.700]   Pack and do it.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.700]   I'm hoping.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:56.300]   Maybe quantum computers will be able to help us get you into a quantum wallet one day.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:57.300]   That might solve it.
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:05.140]   Nobel prizes for the gene editing pioneers who created CRISPR to women, Emmanuel Sharpen
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:06.820]   Tia and Jennifer Doudna.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.460]   By the way, this was a good year for women in the Nobel prizes.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:16.460]   I think the first Nobel prize to physics to go to a woman went to, right?
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:17.460]   Am I right?
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:21.700]   Was that the first time a physics prize has gone to a woman?
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:27.700]   Roger Penrose and, ah, I can't remember his collaborators name, Nobel Prize for their
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:30.940]   work on black holes.
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:33.940]   Okay, nothing to say about that.
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:34.940]   Moving on.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:37.820]   Speaking of digital currency, I was surprised to see this.
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:44.860]   Apparently, the Federal Reserve has joined with seven other central banks to talk about
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:51.620]   how if you were going to do a federal digital currency, how should it be designed?
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:55.780]   The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank for
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.780]   International Settlements.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:04.860]   26-page report, the foundational principles and core features of central bank digital
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:05.860]   currencies.
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:10.180]   They want to get in on the act.
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:15.500]   They're not saying they're doing it, but they're saying if we were, if we were going
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:20.580]   to do it, the Facebook buying Instagram.
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:22.300]   Yeah, this is a good time.
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.300]   Get in on it.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:27.420]   I have some Bitcoin I could give you.
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:32.580]   So they are for tenets of a central bank currency.
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:37.660]   They don't want, for instance, a central bank to compromise financial stability by issuing
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:38.660]   coins.
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:42.940]   It would need to coexist with existing forms of money.
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:47.420]   Core features convertible to maintain the signal of the currency.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:53.940]   A CBD should be exchanged at par with cash and private money.
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:56.660]   It should be as easy to use as cash.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:59.980]   You shouldn't have a wallet with a password.
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:03.180]   You can't remember you tapping a card or scanning a mobile phone.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:04.820]   It should be accepted and available.
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:10.340]   It should be usable in many of the same types of transactions as cash.
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:14.100]   And then I just got to pop up ad for Firefox blocking the fourth one.
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.380]   It's not that important.
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:17.380]   Not that important.
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:20.220]   I don't know why Firefox started doing that all of a sudden.
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.220]   Would they use a blockchain?
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:24.980]   That's the interesting thing to me because you could do a digital currency without having
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:27.260]   to use a blockchain.
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:34.180]   So I'm guessing not because these are central banks and the whole point of a central bank
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:38.660]   is to centralize all the information in one entity.
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:42.180]   And the whole point of blockchain is to decentralize.
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:47.580]   So I guess it becomes an interesting thing, which is like, okay, you wanted to have all
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:53.020]   these, you know, tenets of cash except presumably anonymity.
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:57.220]   Presumably that's not something they actually want to preserve with this.
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:00.820]   Because I can't see that being one of their tenants, right?
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:02.860]   Like I assume that they want it traceable.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:05.140]   And I'll see anything about blockchain here.
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.060]   That's a good point.
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:09.940]   It's interesting that they're looking at there at least looking at it.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:15.380]   Sweden, Switzerland, the European central bank, the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Bank
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:17.380]   of Canada.
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:22.340]   Just thought I'd pass that along.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:25.260]   Slack.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.260]   This is good.
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:27.500]   This will really help productivity.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.260]   We might have to switch to teams.
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:31.540]   We might have to switch to teams.
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:36.900]   Slack is introducing Instagram like stories and push to talk audio.
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:40.460]   So that's great.
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.020]   Slack is supposed to be for work.
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:46.100]   We use Slack, but maybe we should teams doesn't have stories, doesn't it?
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:47.100]   I know.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:48.100]   And I hope not.
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:51.380]   I hope that's not a feature that we copy.
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:55.260]   So the way that they've positioned it actually is less bad than the headline.
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:46:00.380]   The headline, I mean, it seems like just a terrible and awful idea.
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:04.380]   The way they positioned it is to say that it would be like replacing kind of like Loom,
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:08.020]   which is a start up that kind of lets you create asynchronous videos so you could replace
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:13.940]   your daily stand up with short videos that people will record rather than having to have
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.620]   everybody meet it at one time.
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:16.620]   That could be useful.
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:20.860]   My concern is that by them saying stories, that indicates to me that the interaction model
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:25.580]   would be like the Snapchat, Instagram stories motif where you see someone's icon and you
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:28.340]   have to tap or click on it and then watch the update.
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:33.020]   And if that's the case, then that to me completely ruins the productivity aspect.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:38.940]   If it were instead just like you can, everybody can upload a very short video clip to this
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:42.900]   channel or this conversation or whatever, maybe that's interesting.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:43.900]   That's a gag.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.660]   There's some news for that.
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.660]   Yeah, there's some news for that.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:53.460]   I mean, I was very much enjoying some of the Twitter conversations with people who were
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:55.660]   like, can we fix some of these other things?
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:56.660]   Yeah.
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.660]   Yeah.
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:00.180]   Just try to stay up for, although I shouldn't say that to you because Microsoft's had a
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:02.180]   little trouble keeping the servers.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:04.180]   Oh, I mean, obviously like keeping the servers.
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:05.180]   Glass houses, I'm not.
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:06.180]   Yeah, be careful.
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:07.180]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:09.700]   I'm not making any of those claims.
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:14.780]   As a Slack user, I enjoy Slack, but I'm like, that is not something I care about.
[01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:19.580]   It's about wanting to have to like click on people's photos to see their updates.
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:24.500]   Like that's just, I don't want that as my user experience.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:29.940]   On Tuesday, when the president was hopped up on steroids and tweeted a bunch of all
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:35.900]   caps tweets, among others, he tweeted this, repeal section 230.
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:36.900]   That's it.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.540]   That is all three exclamation marks.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:44.620]   I'm amazed even knows what section 230 is.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:46.500]   Well, he did that executive order.
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.020]   Oh, that's right.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.020]   That's right.
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:50.020]   So he does know what it is.
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:52.020]   He knows what it is.
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:53.020]   He doesn't know how to.
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:58.220]   He doesn't seem to know that he doesn't have the power to repeal it by an executive order.
[01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:04.060]   Congress has introduced 17 different bills attacking section 230 this year.
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:10.340]   The White House has two executive orders or two proposals.
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:19.220]   This was after his Facebook and Twitter posts saying that the flu is more deadly than COVID-19.
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.980]   Spoiler, it's not.
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:27.780]   So now maybe he doesn't like me either because Twitter put a misinformation warning on it
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:31.180]   and Facebook surprisingly because they've been pretty tolerant.
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:33.820]   They removed the post entirely.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:43.060]   But ironically, neither Biden nor Trump seemed to understand what section 30 does.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:45.980]   Both of them seem to not like it.
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:53.060]   As Mike Masnick points out in Tech Dirt, it would create the exact opposite of what he
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:49:00.140]   thinks would happen rather than putting pressure on social media companies to leave his posts
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:01.140]   alone.
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:09.420]   They're more likely to put it down because their safe harbor would go away and they could
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:12.820]   be sued right now.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.180]   And it would be a problem for me.
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:19.700]   We have a chat room and we have a forum and I would immediately shut them down if 230
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:23.060]   disappeared because I could be sued over any of the content that's there.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:29.300]   230 provides protection for social media, for chatters, for everybody.
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:31.780]   Otherwise, who would run a chat room?
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:33.940]   The internet would barely exist without 230.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:34.940]   Right.
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:41.140]   And as Mike points out, they would have to, I mean, not only would it break the internet
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:46.300]   in so many ways, but specifically it would break the internet in that anything that someone
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:50.100]   tried to post would need to be vetted before it could get posted.
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:57.140]   Imagine, imagine, Facebook, more than two billion monthly active users vetting every
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:00.580]   single thing you posted before it would appear.
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.020]   >> That would actually, you want to talk about splitting up, you want to talk about
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:08.820]   in name big tech, that's how you in big tech is enacting a law like that because those
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:11.380]   sorts of businesses would not be able to continue.
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:13.140]   They just wouldn't.
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:18.580]   >> I guess that addresses the conservative Congress people's concerns about being discriminated
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:19.580]   against.
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:20.580]   >> Yeah.
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:24.500]   >> They just, nobody would be able to post their thoughts to the internet.
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:30.100]   >> Do you think there would be like this insane lawsuit, avalanche if Section 230 were repealed
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:32.020]   or repealed to get repealed?
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.420]   If the law were to be changed, let's put it that way.
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:37.420]   >> No, I mean, I think Mike has hit the nail on the head that companies aren't going to
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.420]   let that happen.
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:40.420]   They're not going to expose themselves to that kind of liability.
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:41.420]   >> No.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:44.580]   >> They're going to change the way they operate and the internet will fundamentally change.
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:53.300]   >> Would it be prudent for me to shut down our chat room and our forums and not allow comments
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:54.820]   anywhere on any of our sites?
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.660]   It would be prudent, right?
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:59.340]   >> That's the examination that every company is going to have to have.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:07.260]   For every sort of instance where they allow the public to use their platform to post something,
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:10.700]   they're going to have to decide do we still want to take on that liability.
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:19.060]   It would be as though if we use a real world example, a library or a grocery store would
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:27.580]   have to ask you or require you not to speak with the other patrons when you're there because
[01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:32.060]   you might defame them or some such thing in your interaction with them.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:36.860]   And if the store or facility were going to be liable, they wouldn't let you do it.
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:41.900]   >> Denise, would it become a first amendment issue if it were that broad?
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:48.260]   Would that potentially, because usually these things aren't first amendment speech issues,
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:52.820]   in terms of what the private organizations will allow or won't allow.
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:55.980]   But if there was some sort of law passed with these sorts of things, would that potentially
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:57.540]   become a first amendment issue?
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:00.700]   >> It could as to government sites.
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:03.540]   That's really where the first amendment kicks in.
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:07.700]   Private entities like Facebook and Twitter, et cetera.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:11.140]   They get to, they're not really impacted by the first amendment.
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:13.380]   They get to- >> I understood that a bit.
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:14.380]   >> Yeah.
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:15.860]   >> I guess my, sorry, sorry.
[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:19.380]   I should have been more clear, because I understand obviously that the private companies aren't
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.540]   bound by that.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:27.700]   But since the message of speech is being transferred using, it's not quite a public utility, but
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:34.260]   it certainly has backing the internet itself of publicly funded things.
[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:35.940]   Does that change it at all?
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:40.220]   >> Yeah, I think it's a really interesting question.
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:46.660]   >> 2030 doesn't just apply to private entities.
[01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:53.860]   The language is internet service provider, I believe, something along those lines.
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:53:00.060]   And that not meaning ISP in the way that we understand that term.
[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:03.420]   But the platform on which you're interacting.
[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:14.140]   And yeah, that could be, it could be Facebook providing a platform for a congressperson,
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:17.820]   say, to interact with their constituents.
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:21.140]   And then they can't, because Facebook's shutting that down.
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:22.660]   >> No, that's interesting.
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:27.020]   >> That's where courts have said the first amendment kicks in and protects that kind of
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:31.060]   speech, blocks people, et cetera.
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:34.660]   So yeah, the first amendment could well come into play there.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:36.500]   >> It would be a mess.
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:39.020]   Fortunately, Congress isn't doing nothing.
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:46.460]   But I just want to point out both candidates in the election coming up in three weeks,
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:51.140]   both candidates have said they want to repeal or somehow change Section 230.
[01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:55.340]   >> Yeah, you're kind of out of luck if you're a one-issue voter on that issue.
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:59.380]   >> Yeah, so this would be an opportunity moment to write a letter or something.
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:01.180]   >> It would be to the EFF.
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:07.900]   >> Yeah, donate to the EFF, write to your Congress Critter, let them know how you feel.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:13.900]   Guys, this has become the court and government episode, hasn't it?
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.500]   One more story.
[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:21.220]   A judge, California judge has denied EPICS request that Apple be forced to reinstate Fortnite
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:23.220]   in the app store.
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:29.660]   They did say that the Unreal Engine cannot be harmed because Apple was threatening to
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:33.500]   revoke developer accounts to Epic Games.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:39.420]   The judge said this is already happened in a preliminary injunction and now it's been
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:40.420]   reaffirmed.
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:45.220]   Yes, Apple can kick you out of the store.
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:52.060]   No, they can't take away your developer certificates for the Unreal Engine.
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:55.060]   So, I don't know.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:56.060]   Is there more to say about that?
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:03.500]   This one we're going to hear a lot more that the trial is until May 3rd.
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:06.940]   >> I guess the only thing I have to add there is that this is the kind of thing.
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:12.220]   It doesn't matter so much what this court does or doesn't do except for how Congress
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:16.700]   is going to interpret what the courts are doing and whether Congress needs to step in
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:21.620]   because Apple's control of its app store is a huge part.
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:26.020]   It's the primary part of what Congress is concerned about Apple on the antitrust front.
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:32.660]   >> Actually, if you read those 14 juiciest quotes, two of the juicier quotes are actually
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:38.340]   from Apple showing that they do indeed, they do indeed sometimes favor companies by do
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:45.060]   in this case, even though they denied that repeatedly and have often said, "No, no,
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:46.780]   we treat everyone fairly."
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:47.940]   You know what I'm going to call it.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:52.460]   I think we've had enough court and legal action for the day.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:55.900]   I am so glad my counselor was here from this weekend law.
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:58.700]   Denise, how it's great to see you always.
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:01.100]   I'm glad things are going well.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:02.540]   >> So great to be here.
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:03.540]   >> Come back soon.
[01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:06.300]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:08.100]   >> I don't want to plug anything in particular.
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:13.820]   I just want to emphasize how happy and lucky I feel to be here with you all today and I
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:16.060]   hope you're all doing well.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:20.740]   I want to take a moment to congratulate you, Leo, on what is it?
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:22.540]   You started this network in 2005?
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:24.220]   >> 15 years ago, yeah.
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.220]   >> Oh my God.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:26.220]   >> 15 years.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:28.980]   >> I was a young man when this all started.
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:29.980]   No.
[01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:30.980]   >> It's such a great community.
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:32.620]   >> I wasn't even a young man then.
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:33.620]   >> Yeah.
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:38.660]   It's such a great community and a tribe that you've developed and I'm just so thrilled.
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:43.180]   You have many podcast options all of you listening to us probably more than ever today.
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:47.540]   The fact that you've joined us all today meets the world to me and I'm sure all of
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:48.540]   us.
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:49.540]   >> Thank you.
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:53.340]   >> It's been a tough year and it's not getting any easier.
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:57.220]   I just want to tell people how much I appreciate them.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:58.340]   I'm good at answering emails.
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:00.220]   I'm Denise at twit.tv.
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:05.220]   If anything's on your mind, you just need to vent, talk, chat, connect.
[01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:06.220]   I'm here.
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:07.220]   >> Is that nice of you?
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:08.220]   >> Shout out.
[01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:09.220]   >> I've always, you're just great.
[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:10.220]   Thank you, Denise.
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.180]   I've had ditto right back to you.
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:13.940]   I've always thought the world of you.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:14.940]   >> Thank you so much.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:17.020]   >> Thrilled to be able to get you on the show.
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:18.900]   Same with you, Christina, Christina Warren.
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:20.420]   She's film girl.
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:23.300]   I've known you since you were knee high to a grasshopper.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:24.300]   >> You have.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.300]   >> Yeah.
[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.300]   >> You have.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.300]   Yeah.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:33.700]   I'm always so grateful and happy every time you ask me to be on the show and I've been a
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:37.700]   fan of yours since I was younger.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:43.660]   We won't, we won't, exactly.
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.660]   Actually, can I plug something?
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:46.660]   >> Please, yes.
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:47.660]   >> Okay.
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:48.660]   So this is kind of cool.
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:50.660]   I've got a new podcast coming out.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:56.300]   I believe it'll be on Wednesday that I did with Verizon and T brand at the New York Times
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:58:00.020]   and it's called Networked and the 5G future.
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:02.220]   I know, I know we were kind of making fun of 5G.
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:03.220]   >> Oh, God.
[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:04.220]   I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:05.620]   >> No, no, no, no, you're fine.
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:06.620]   You're fine.
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:07.620]   But it's actually really interesting.
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:13.620]   I interviewed a ton of people in different industries, education, healthcare, sports,
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:17.740]   esports, music, and other cities and whatnot.
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:21.820]   And we talked about what some of the challenges around connectivity are and not talking about
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:27.500]   like solutions that might fix it in the near term, but solutions that technology could
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:32.780]   empower to maybe solve some of those or help with some of those challenges in the future.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:35.100]   The first episode is about education will be out this Wednesday.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:40.740]   I'm really happy with how it turned out and so to Networked, just want to plug that.
[01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:41.740]   >> That's great.
[01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:42.740]   Where can we find it?
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:44.740]   I guess wherever you want to get podcasts.
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:50.180]   You just search Networked on Apple Podcasts or Google or Spotify or whatever.
[01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:54.740]   I think there's like a two minute kind of preview thing right now and then the first
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:56.380]   episode will be out this week.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:59:01.700]   >> Networked the 5G future hosted by Christina Warren.
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:02.780]   I'm so thrilled.
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:03.780]   That's exciting.
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:08.500]   Is it an open end and one or are there going to just be a number, just a certain number
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.500]   of shows?
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.780]   >> We reported a certain of episodes but I don't know for sure.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:14.500]   I mean there's always a possibility it could go beyond that.
[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:19.180]   But we recorded a certain of episodes and that was kind of my fun quarantine project.
[01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:20.180]   So it was a-
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:21.180]   >> Fun.
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:23.540]   >> Well, I'm ready to hear a case be made for 5G.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:24.540]   So good.
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:25.540]   I want to hear all about it.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:26.540]   That's great.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:27.540]   Great.
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:28.540]   Thank you so much.
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:32.620]   And Phil Liben, another person I've known for a long time and I've always been proud.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.060]   Now he's in his bunny.
[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:37.260]   You're back in your beehive.
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:38.900]   You're muted also.
[01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:40.740]   There's no buzzing in the beehive.
[01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.620]   >> I'm not being muted.
[01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:44.980]   >> Now you're okay.
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:46.780]   >> I wasn't before.
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:47.780]   Can you actually hear me?
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:48.780]   >> Yeah.
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:49.780]   I couldn't hear you earlier.
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:50.780]   >> You're here.
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:54.220]   >> All of these great backgrounds come from Phil's app.
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:58.460]   MMHMM.app.
[01:59:58.460 --> 01:59:59.460]   Is it free?
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:02.460]   I don't- you've never asked for money.
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:03.940]   Well, we're still in beta.
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:04.940]   So it's still the beta app.
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:05.940]   >> Well, that's why.
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:10.100]   You can sign up at that app and then when we launch, which hopefully is coming up pretty
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:11.500]   soon now, I think we're getting close.
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:12.500]   It'll be free in the end.
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:13.740]   It'll be a free version.
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:15.380]   It'll be a premium version.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:19.380]   We are big believers in direct revenue models only.
[02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:25.020]   So we make money when people want to pay us for using our products.
[02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:27.700]   >> You've learned, and I see you've added a lot of features.
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:28.700]   This is great.
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:30.340]   >> Yeah, there's a bunch of new stuff.
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:31.340]   >> Yeah.
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:32.340]   >> Just about every week.
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:34.060]   >> I just gotta say, I got a plug.
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:36.260]   I love whatever it takes.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:41.260]   Denise's idea of a world where people are not allowed to speak to me at a grocery store.
[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:43.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:46.700]   >> Just stay out of my aisle, man.
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:47.700]   I don't care.
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:48.700]   >> You don't speak to me in a grocery store.
[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:50.260]   >> I don't even want you in the aisle with me.
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:53.340]   I want to be all alone and I want my aisle to myself.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:54.340]   >> Over it takes.
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:55.340]   >> It's the weirdest thing.
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:58.100]   Sometimes you go shopping and you're all alone in an aisle.
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:01.460]   And finally, five people come and they come nearer and nearer and nearer.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:02.460]   [SINGING]
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:06.580]   And I'm like, and I'm masked up.
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:08.020]   I got a face shield.
[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:11.860]   I'm gonna have to get more scary stuff to protect me.
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:15.540]   Okay, no one can ask Phil anything in the grocery store.
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:18.500]   If you see him, just wave.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.420]   Say, I know who you are.
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:22.300]   I appreciate your work.
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:24.340]   All dash turtles dot com.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:26.180]   It's always great to have you on.
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:30.340]   You're so smart and you've got so much history and so much knowledge about the industry.
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:31.340]   >> Thank you.
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:32.740]   It's always good to be on here.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:36.100]   >> Our show this week in tech appears every Sunday.
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:37.100]   We do the show.
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:41.060]   We record it and you're welcome to watch us do it live Sunday afternoon, 230 Pacific,
[02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:44.260]   530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:51.540]   The live streams, there's audio and video and they're a variety of each at twit.tv/live.
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:55.020]   So by the way, if you're watching live, you certainly should be in the chat room because
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:59.860]   they're all chatting at the same time and it's IRC.twit.tv.
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:04.220]   And the live stream sometimes has recorded material after the fact, after the show's
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:07.820]   over like later tonight, but the chat room seems to go on all the time.
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:08.820]   They're talking at me.
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:11.020]   They're pretending they're listening.
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:14.460]   I'll sometimes sneak in there and go, I hear what you're saying.
[02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:15.780]   Just throw them off.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:16.780]   It's a great place.
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:19.820]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:22.020]   Most people though listen or watch on demand.
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:25.420]   We have on-demand audio and video available in a variety of places, our website's the
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.820]   first place to look.
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:27.820]   Twit.tv.
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:31.500]   Actually, all of our shows are there.
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:34.900]   We also have a YouTube channel for this and every other show we do.
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:38.500]   Just go to youtube.com/twit and you'll find links to all the individual channels plus
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:44.780]   Twitbits and other features there or search for Twit in your favorite podcast application
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:45.780]   and subscribe.
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:48.180]   That way you'll kind of get it automatically.
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:49.820]   We are putting together our best ofs.
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:54.460]   In fact, I think we're getting, believe it or not, getting close to finishing them.
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:58.980]   I know it's only October, but we run these at the end of the year, kind of our holiday
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:02:59.980]   specials.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:04.180]   If you have a moment from this show or any of our Twitch shows that you say, "Oh, it has
[02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:08.380]   to be from this year," but I know this has been an interesting year, it has to be in the
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:13.620]   best of at the end of the year, go to twit.tv/bestof and you can fill out a form there.
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:19.180]   You don't have to fill out every field, but anything you can give us will help us figure
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:23.820]   out where that clip was from and perhaps include it in our best of episode, which will be coming
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:25.740]   up later this year.
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:27.420]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:28.380]   We'll see you next time.
[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:34.380]   As I have said now for 15 years in a row, another Twit is in the game.
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:41.820]   Bye bye.
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:43.820]   Alright, doing the twist.
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:52.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
