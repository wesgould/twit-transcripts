[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.080]   I'm excited. I love this panel.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.480]   Some of my favorite people, Alex Wilhelm is here.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.880]   Owner of my childhood home reporter at TechCrunch at Alex.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.520]   I wish I only wish I'd sold it to you, Alex.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.320]   And I would have some money for it.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.160]   Yes, sadly, you got none of the profits, but you have
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.280]   dragooned me into being on Twit for like 10 years now.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.440]   So I have to resolve.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.560]   As a result, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.520]   A pleasure to be here.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.320]   Thank you as always.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.160]   It's always a pleasure to see you also with us from Tech meme ride home.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.560]   The internet historian himself, Brian McCullough.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.920]   Great to see you.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.640]   Hello, Leo in the pitch black environment.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.040]   Where are you these days? Where do you live?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.840]   In Brooklyn, usually I when I do these, I do them from my office.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.400]   And so this is the first time I'm doing it from my house and it didn't work out.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.880]   And so I'm trying to hide everything.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.360]   It's fine.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   Just to be clear, though, this is not my childhood home.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.160]   Right.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.440]   I mean, I don't think it is.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   Anyway, could be.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.160]   I don't know.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.880]   It's confusing.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.360]   I was born in New York, raised in Rhode Island.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.600]   And now we also go down the peninsula a bit to say hello to Mike Elgin, our good friend.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.560]   Last time I saw you, Mike, you were in Wohaka.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.840]   We were in Wohaka.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.640]   Yep.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.480]   You're going back tomorrow.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.240]   Back tomorrow, we're going to be in Mexico City for three days and then Wohaka
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.480]   for a week and then back here for the holidays.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.680]   This was an amazing gap.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.960]   We're going to actually get Mike and Amirah on our discord server to a special
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.280]   guest or a nomad experiences because super excited about that.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   I can't wait.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.800]   Can't wait.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.200]   And I just a huge pleasure to do this.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.640]   They go all over the world.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.840]   We were in Wohaka for the day of the dead.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.960]   It was incredible.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.840]   The food, the people were with us.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.280]   It was just so much fun.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.200]   And then you left to go to Indiana with Kevin, your son.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.520]   How did that go?
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.880]   It was huge.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.480]   Leo is so amazing.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.160]   So it was the Indiana Tech Conference.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.400]   So it was a little in Indiana who run this thing, just do an amazing job.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   And they bring literally educators from all the schools in the state to this place.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.800]   And Chatterbox was the featured tech product.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.560]   And he was doing four sessions a day and it was just amazing.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.800]   All these educators who were dying to get back in their classrooms were learning
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.080]   about Chatterbox, learning how to build it, all that kind of stuff.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.920]   So it was really, really, and I was basically a booth bunny.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.720]   We don't say that anymore, do we?
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.480]   I was a representative in the booth and no, it was absolutely amazing.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.720]   It was its first time I'd ever been to Indiana.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.080]   And it was just a really great experience for all of us.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.760]   Chatterbox is Kevin's.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.320]   If you go to Hello, Chatterbox.com, you can read about it.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.600]   Kevin's smart speaker that's designed for kids to learn literacy, to learn that the
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.720]   speaker is not a human and you don't have to say please and thank you.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.720]   But it's also private, which is great.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.840]   Really cool, cool, cool product.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.160]   It's a wonderful one.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.880]   If you want to know more, hello, Chatterbox.com.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.640]   So the last time Adam Curry was on the show,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.840]   he expressed his feelings that the US military had built a army base on the dark
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.360]   side of the moon.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.520]   That was the last time Adam Curry was on the moon.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.520]   But I imagine, yeah, ever on the moon or on the show, but I imagine he is perhaps
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.920]   taking a victory lap right now because China's U2 rover has spotted what the Chinese
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.040]   are calling a mystery hut on the dark side of the moon.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.920]   It is a as close as you can.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.320]   And they're still they're going to drive over and see the three months away from that.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.640]   But it takes a while, I guess.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:17.320]   But it's apparently about 20 meters in height and it looks like a pretty human made
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.720]   cube. Yeah.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.400]   It's a 2001 space, honestly, but it's our moon and it's sorry.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.760]   Should I call it the monolith?
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.280]   It should be a monolith.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.800]   Yeah, it's better than probably got there.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.120]   No, no, hot is 20 meters tall.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.120]   I think is when I would start with that's a little hot.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.600]   Probably not a good structure for the moon.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.760]   More like for the South Pacific, maybe or
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.280]   it's only as warmer.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.960]   It's puzzling because it's only 260 feet away from the rover, but it's taking three
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.560]   months to get there.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.360]   Again, just it doesn't move very fast.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.760]   Get a helicopter, China, like everybody else.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.320]   You know, it feels to me like it would be a great movie like Bruce Willis and Matt
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.800]   Damon decide they want to get there before the Chinese rover.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.200]   Three months to create a mission, launch it and get there to find out what that cube
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.400]   is.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.280]   And then of course, yeah, we're the Americans in the Russians want to be first to film
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.520]   a movie there, Tom Cruise is trying to get to the hot.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.320]   But it's crazy.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.200]   Anyway, probably it's a boulder.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.760]   This side of the moon has a lot had a lot of impacts.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.800]   I mean, your impact is probably just a boulder that is coincidentally square.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.800]   But it could be the long lost military base on the dark side of the moon.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.360]   And I'm sure Adam will say it is for the next three months.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.120]   So I just want to give him a little heads up.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   It's it's it's it's there.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.960]   It's out there.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.800]   The truth is out there.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.320]   That's not the big story of the week.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.000]   Probably the big story of the week is Jack Dorsey's tweet,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:04.400]   which went not sure anyone has heard, but I resign from Twitter out of here left that day.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.880]   Now, Alex Wilhelm, you cover financial markets.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.000]   So there's been a number of speculat about a speculation.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.360]   One is that the the activist investors,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.280]   Elliot management who wanted Jack out last spring, maybe finally got their way.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.000]   What do you think?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.480]   I'm sure that's part of it.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.880]   The other thing to keep in mind is that Jack has had an increase in interest in
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.560]   all things kind of cryptocurrency.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.360]   And I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted some more time to focus on that.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.800]   And with the changes we've seen at his other company Square,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   it's not an enormous surprise to me that he was willing to kind of set down the Twitter mantle,
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.960]   especially because he had his kind of number two in place ready to take over.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.240]   And you know, Twitter is in a good spot right now.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.920]   I feel like it's product work has been really good.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   They did fend off Elliot for some time.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.080]   But you know, I mean, how long can you really run to public companies when your
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.640]   hearts only really in one of them?
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.840]   That's my general read.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.440]   It's less pernicious and more is kind of like maybe it's about time.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.600]   The markets generally kind of disappointed that Twitter, given its importance,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.880]   its cultural currency doesn't make more money.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.920]   And so they've been angry at Jack as if that's his fault.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.400]   I'm not sure it is his fault.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.280]   It's also, you know, he's not the only tech CEO to say, yeah,
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.080]   I'm going to get out of here now before it gets really hot in the kitchen.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.480]   Yeah, could have something to do with that, you agree, Mike?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.800]   Well, I think that I think that the problem, I mean, I personally am disappointed
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.560]   because I feel like Jack Dorsey for whatever perceived flaws he may have was
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.880]   at least a very, very thoughtful person.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.320]   Well, presumably still is.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.680]   He's a very thoughtful person.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:45.000]   And he's he's I thought he was he did his best for the policy parts of it,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.240]   for dealing with the impossible task of having free speech, but also not allowing
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.720]   lunatics to create too much trouble, etc, etc.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.800]   And he handed the reins over to somebody who's essentially a technologist.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.400]   I don't really think that the technology part of it is well,
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.520]   certainly not as a user, the part that interests me the most.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.120]   I would love for Twitter to continue to be the public square.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.000]   Obviously, it's a terrible business
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.040]   compared to Facebook, their Instagram or any of those other companies that have
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.400]   so many more opportunities to make so much more money simply because it's text based
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.880]   and it's for people who want like a news fire hose and that's always going to be a
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.080]   minority, right? So I think Twitter, you know, I would have loved for Twitter
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.280]   to have been the pet project of some billionaire.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:43.160]   So he didn't have the the pressure from activist investors to push them to try
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.960]   to make it a cash cow like Instagram is.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.800]   But well, and of course, sort of interestingly, the markets initial reaction to
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.080]   Jack's resignation was to boost Twitter's price by as much as 10 percent.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.480]   And then they announced that the Twitter CTO, also the guy in charge of Twitter's
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:09.920]   crypto arm, Parag Agro wall was going to take over and stop plummeted.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.320]   Right.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.280]   So sell sell sell.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.880]   This is this is your article, Alex, along with Natasha and Amanda.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.720]   Jack is leaving Twitter and we have thoughts.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.640]   No, this is the equity.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.480]   Sorry about that headline.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.080]   We have thoughts.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.600]   We've been working a lot this year.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.280]   And so my title and headline discipline has declined in the last couple of weeks.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.320]   What does the mean around thoughts?
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.840]   What does that mean?
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.560]   Tilda thoughts, Tilda, is that like?
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.160]   So it's like this.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.960]   So you don't read it.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.480]   Jack is leaving Twitter and we have thoughts.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.680]   I believe that's the news.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.440]   It's scared.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.160]   Tilda's is that what you're saying?
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.240]   Yeah, or skilled us if you're into it.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.520]   To Mike's point, though, the issue with Twitter and the billionaire idea is that
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.800]   it's a little bit too expensive.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.200]   I mean, Twitter, I just pulled up its stock chart here.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.480]   Even after a lot of declines in the last couple of months, it's still worth
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.280]   $34 billion.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.200]   And so it's not really an asset you've had a tuck under your arm like
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.120]   Washington Post.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.520]   I was on Musk.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.600]   I was on Musk.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.960]   I was on the phone.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.160]   I was on the phone.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.560]   I was on Musk.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.600]   Yeah, even Eli's not going to spend that much money on a money losing
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.800]   social network.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.240]   Come on.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.840]   Right.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.680]   Now you're right.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.920]   It's too much fun for free.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.520]   So I just wish it would have happened like 15, you know, 10 years ago,
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.400]   12 years, you know,
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.840]   that's the irony of this is people like Elon love Twitter and use it and they
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.600]   use it for free.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.160]   And so they don't need to buy it because they've got the benefit of it.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.240]   They don't need to own this.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.040]   What is it? Is it a dog? Is it is?
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.000]   Oh, no, no, it's not a dog.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.800]   It's not growing as quickly as it should.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.720]   But I mean, like they just rolled out Twitter blue.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.880]   They've done very well with their audio product.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.040]   They bought a newsletter,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.680]   Twitter is managing to kind of build on top of its core ethos, which is what
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.640]   Mike said, that the stream of news, the firehose of headlines.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.200]   And I'm kind of bullish.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.080]   I mean, I'm now a Twitter blue subscriber.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.520]   I've never paid Twitter before.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.800]   Anybody here in the pan three bucks a month for Twitter blue?
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.560]   I'm not.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   You're not.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.000]   I just haven't had time to be the first person.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.720]   How about you, Brian?
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.680]   I am paying and yeah, that's who Twitter blue appeals to tech journalists.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.440]   Right.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.800]   One of the problems that's that's who Twitter appeals to Twitter.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.000]   Yeah, but see, that's always been sort of the problem, like philosophically,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.560]   Twitter, there were times when they thought or at least the markets thought
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   that they should be like Facebook and have billions of users or whatever.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.680]   Like, I feel like the problem has always been from a business perspective is that
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.720]   they have the alternates and you can make a business out of alternates.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.840]   You can make a business out of only the, you know, that 10% law or the whatever
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.200]   the percentages of your users that produce most of the content.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.960]   It's just that they've never tried to.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.600]   And so like Alex is saying, a lot of these products are like, all right, fine.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.960]   There's a certain percentage of you that live on Twitter all day and I'll raise
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.720]   my hand for that one.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.360]   And so by the way, throw a couple of shekels at us a month and but, you know,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.920]   that's theoretically a good way to start building a business.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.240]   Can I can I make one other point, though?
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.040]   Yes, this might this might lead us into
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.880]   what will logically be the next discussion into square slash block.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:24.760]   But, you know, so the only person left of these of this generation of founders
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:30.560]   of of social media platforms that is still at his founded company is is Zuck.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.520]   And we talked about earlier how it's maybe no fun to run one of these anymore.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.760]   Everybody hate you.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.040]   Somebody's not having fun.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.680]   It's got to be Mark Zuckerberg right now, right?
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:47.520]   So, you know, when Jack has a choice, it's not exactly a Sophie's choice.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.160]   He's going to pick one company.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.360]   One of the reasons and this will get into
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.960]   the idea of Web 3, if you want to cover that.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.920]   Oh, Lord, we are.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.000]   We're going to talk about it because we can't know.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.960]   So why is Zuck doing meta and the rebrand?
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:10.880]   Because all of the energy seems to be in crypto and NFTs and Web 3.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   That's where the talent is going.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.320]   People are, you know, fleeing, not fleeing, but jumping ship to these Web 3
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.240]   companies and all the kids have bored
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.280]   a icons on their Twitter accounts and things like that.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.520]   So one way to look at it is is Jack sees more fun and maybe what Jack was
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.240]   into, which is sort of like utopian style, changing the world stuff, which he can do
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.440]   with Square that he can't do with Twitter, where it's essentially a maintenance job.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.600]   It's putting out fires.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.480]   I should point out that Bitcoin has gone down like $10,000 since he he he quit.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.920]   Related? No.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.360]   No, no, no.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.480]   But let's talk about the story.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.920]   I like to stir the pot a little bit.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.200]   OK, we're actually going to get to block.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   I really do want to talk about that and Web 3.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.880]   But let's stay with Twitter for a little bit longer.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.600]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.000]   Yeah, the crypto flash crash is a lot of fun.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.800]   We will talk about that because nothing makes me giggle more than watching everyone
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.600]   who brags about crypto prices all of a sudden goes silent as a unit.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.320]   No, they'll be back.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:10.840]   Don't worry.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.720]   Oh, they always are.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.600]   I take a point about Twitter, but talking about Twitter as if it is this kind of
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.640]   failed entity and I do agree in comparison to Facebook or meta, depending on how you
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.000]   want to call it, it is small.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.520]   But in the last quarter, Twitter had 1.28 billion in revenue up 37 percent year
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.000]   over year.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.080]   How much profit are business?
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.080]   They had adjusted operating profit of like 23 million.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.320]   OK, I mean, it's not, you know, and they have that weird metric that's monetizable
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.480]   users or something, but they're growing that metric, which is the one that they want
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.840]   people to care about, right?
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.080]   Yes, MDIU, which is the most non gap way to the same people use our site and we
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   sell them stuff.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.520]   I don't know why they had to invent that.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.200]   Well, they did because the growth is stagnant.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.680]   So they had to make up some other number that didn't reflect growth.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.800]   Real growth, right?
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.280]   OK, look, Leo, let's tweet more.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.600]   Let's help them out.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.000]   You know, let's let's go.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.680]   It's not that we're not tweeting enough.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.200]   It's that it's the same 300 million people tweeting.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.240]   It's there's no growth in their in their user base.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.400]   I think the problem with their business is that we're all we're all somehow, for
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.240]   some reason, gotten all wrapped up in the all importance of massive profits.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.280]   Why do we care?
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.160]   As long as they have enough money to survive.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.760]   I think the thing that's interesting, if you don't own Twitter stock, why do you care?
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.720]   Exactly.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:30.920]   Exactly.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.640]   They're cultural significance, gigantic.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.000]   It's that's right.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.680]   Arguably bigger than Facebook.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.800]   But that's the problem is you have this huge cultural significance and $24
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.200]   million in revenue.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.840]   Yeah, I'm happy with that profit.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.800]   I'm happy with that.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.880]   What's wrong with that?
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.000]   It feels like that should be bigger.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   If you're that important, it should be big.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.960]   All right, Leo.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.720]   Keep the that's only four million.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.120]   What?
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.560]   Eight million dollars a month.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.720]   It's nothing.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.280]   What is the?
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.800]   I mean, it's more profitable than Twit.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.520]   It's more profitable than you.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.800]   OK, they make more in a month than we make in a year, but it's still for something.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.360]   That's Twitter.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.640]   We're talking here.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   What's Facebook's profit of a infinite infinite?
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.240]   So big.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.920]   Mike Mike said at the outset that Jack is very thoughtful, right?
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.880]   And the problem is, is that from Wall Street's perspective, he was thoughtful
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.000]   to the point of being unable to make unable to make any decisions.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.320]   It's only in the last year that this sudden I remember when it happened
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.600]   on my show, we kept saying, Oh, hell froze over again.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.600]   Twitter actually iterated on product.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.520]   But now that joke is this is is is way dead because they've done nothing.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.040]   But this product over the last six months, this six months has been an amazing
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.880]   unprecedented for Twitter. But there are those who say Twitter doesn't need to
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.480]   iterate on product.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.360]   Right. In fact, the best thing Twitter could do is just stay Twitter.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.480]   Right.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.680]   So there's a big risk.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.200]   There's a big risk for Twitter when they change things because it's working as it is.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.240]   I know it's not profitable.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   Actually, Ben Thompson has a great piece on this in which he said,
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.040]   Twitter can't be profitable with an ad model because of the nature of Twitter.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.320]   He says Instagram for him.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.280]   Here's Instagram. Instagram does very well with that model because it's a it's a
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.560]   sit back engagement.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.320]   You're sitting there.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.800]   You're leisurely looking at photos.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   You get a photo for, you know, a new kind of underwear.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.560]   It's not such a big deal to buy it.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.760]   Peter Twitter, he says, quoting Ben Thompson in Stratecary is intense and combative
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.080]   and far more likely to be tied to something happening in the physical world,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.000]   whether that be watching sports or politics or doing work.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.120]   And that does not lend itself well to.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.040]   Oh, in the middle of all this, let me click and buy some underwear.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.400]   So Twitter, they said, he says, and I think I don't think he's wrong.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.960]   Twitter's not going to make money, especially with the kind of direct
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.320]   response advertising that they're doing.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.520]   It may be brand advertising, but at least not click to buy advertising.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.760]   And then he says that's one problem.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.480]   Another problem is the number of people who actually want to experience the
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.800]   internet this way and this intense lean forward thing is relatively small.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.600]   People know about Twitter, but people don't go, oh, I got to get on there,
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.360]   except us, you know, there's a group of people that do.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   So his suggestion is there are there is a group of people, a few hundred million
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:34.280]   people that certainly value Twitter, often professionally politicians, sports,
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.360]   stars, tech journalists, those people will pay.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.960]   He says, Twitter should just make it be a pay service period.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.360]   Is that crazy?
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.080]   Well, it's it goes back to what I was saying before, which is that it would
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.200]   essentially to me involve ruining Twitter for the benefit of the minority who make
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.280]   money from Twitter.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.760]   It's basically saying that the monetary significance for the shareholders is more
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.160]   important than the cultural significance for everybody.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   So even the people who don't use Twitter benefit enormously from journalists
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.960]   talking to politicians, hearing from these other people interacting with each
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.520]   other with professors, it's a it's a
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.280]   the town square isn't just for the people at the town square meeting.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.520]   Well, what if you had to pay to post but not pay to read?
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.680]   Yeah, that would be better.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.960]   I guess in a way, that's really what Twitter blue is.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.640]   It's going to capture those people probably three bucks a month.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.840]   It's it's going to capture those people.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.040]   Leo, multiply it by five, charge me 15 and take away the advertisements.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.240]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.920]   You would prefer. So like just admit the fact it's not to be a billion people.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.280]   Realize that those of us who use it use it a lot.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.720]   Realize that those of us who use it a lot don't want ads in our iOS feed.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.600]   And let me pay you to get rid of them.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.760]   Can the people please can the there's nowhere else the people who use it can go.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.320]   Right.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.640]   There's a certain use for Twitter.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.720]   For instance, if if if somebody tells me
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.560]   Bob Dole just passed away.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.720]   First thing I'm going to do is go to Twitter.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.240]   Right.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.520]   Right.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.360]   Because maybe not Bob Dole, but if we're a famous person.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.000]   I would go to.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.800]   Oh, Bob Dole was famous.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.480]   Too soon.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.480]   If I were a comedian that did him Bob Dole impressions,
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.680]   I probably would have stopped doing them long ago.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.680]   Let's put it that nobody under the age of 30 knows who Bob exactly.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.360]   Exactly.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.880]   So 40 Mike, I think.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.560]   And I only use that because he did pass away.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.240]   But today, but I don't know what if Paul McCartney passed away?
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.320]   If somebody told me Paul McCartney's dead, I would immediately go to Twitter to verify it.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.440]   So there's so there's certain things you do.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.120]   You know, earthquakes, earthquakes in the California.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.120]   It's all about earthquakes.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.960]   If you're a big F one fan, we won't say no spoilers because Alex hasn't watched the race yet.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.080]   But you would.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.240]   And that's by the way, to Ben Thomas's point, you would actually have it open
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.280]   while you're watching and you'd have a community around you.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.840]   Same thing with the Oscars or any any other live event talking about it.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.680]   Yeah, those are the people who and I think those people would be willing to pay.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:03.960]   I don't know.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.760]   15 bucks.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.560]   That's a lot.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.240]   But say seven bucks, eight bucks a month.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:17.920]   Mike, what Mike, one more thing that you said was that Twitter would benefit from a billionaire sort of
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.680]   Jeff Bezos.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.000]   Yeah, well, but guess what?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.240]   We had a billionaire sort of benevolently overseeing it for us.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.080]   There's a piece that Mike Solana, another Mike wrote this week about Jack.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.320]   And he ended like this saying, I think we're all about to realize just how much he was
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.640]   being quietly in stewardship over a power he was wise enough to fear and good enough not to use.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.600]   So that's the flip side of Jack being overly thoughtful.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.880]   Perhaps we're going to find out pretty quickly that for the last six years,
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.360]   we had a really useful guy overseeing Twitter and not
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.000]   being it up too badly.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.040]   That's how I feel.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.240]   Exactly.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.960]   Why do you announce that day of,
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.520]   isn't it more typical that you would say as Bezos did?
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.960]   I'm going to have a theory.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:17.240]   OK, I have a theory and it involves block and square, which is the block square
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.400]   announcement happened.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.040]   I think it was the 12 year anniversary of squares first,
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.520]   I don't know, public trial or public beta being launched or something.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.640]   So he needed to get the Twitter news out of the way so that he could launch
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.800]   the square block news that was probably really where his heart was at anyway.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.200]   So almost immediately after resigning,
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.400]   he announced that Square announced it was going to change its name to block.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.520]   By the way, why is that a big announcement?
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.360]   It's just a name to be a it's like changing the name to meta.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.480]   Yeah, but it's different though, because remember when Square bought title
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.760]   and we were all standing around going like, whoa, why is a consumer
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.520]   service and a business transaction application buying when this news broke?
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.640]   I was on twig and I mentioned Square
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.240]   by title and everybody went really?
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.600]   Nobody remembers that exactly.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.320]   But my point is as a holding company that may make digital products via the
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.840]   blockchain for artists and musicians, it makes a lot more sense to block the
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.640]   holding company to own type.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.680]   Because you know who makes money on NFTs, the people who mint them.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.880]   Yeah, not the creators, not the buyers, the people who mint them.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.720]   For 12 bucks a pop.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.200]   They're the ones making money.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.960]   You think that's what Square wants to do?
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.360]   That kind of thing.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   I mean, it makes more sense than it did before.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.400]   I mean, I don't think that we fully understand where Jack wants to go with
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.520]   block, but on the point about him leaving, though, one last little little note,
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.040]   if you go read the letter he posted on Twitter, he talks a lot about how
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.560]   companies shouldn't always be run by its founder and he talks a little bit.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.360]   He does mention go. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.000]   And inside a Silicon Valley, that was heresy.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   Because the Mark Zuckerberg Facebook story was an early data point that led
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.240]   people to think that maybe startup founders should not only stay CEO of their
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.920]   company through their public private life, but also into their public life.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.640]   And here was the job also.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.920]   Yeah. Well, I
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.640]   take that Jack writes.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.440]   There's a lot of talk.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.320]   This is in his tweet.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.280]   There's a lot of talk, by the way, I think it's ironic that Jack Dorsey can't
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.680]   find a way to resign in 280 characters.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.280]   He does what everybody else does and posts a picture of his resignation.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.640]   Jack Hint Hint.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.840]   There's a lot of talk about the importance of a company being, quote,
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.080]   founder led.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.560]   Ultimately, I believe that's severely limiting and a single point of failure.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.920]   I've worked hard to ensure this company could break away from its founding and
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.600]   founders.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.760]   There are many companies that get to this level and there aren't many founders
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.400]   that choose their company over their own ego.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.800]   That's an interesting shot.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.680]   Who's he thinking?
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.360]   Spicy.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:55.920]   Spicy.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.760]   Mark, all of them.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.120]   Mark, it's Mark and it's also Leo the porch.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.680]   I want to announce my resignation today, but I'm going to keep doing the show if
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.040]   you don't mind. OK.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:13.560]   I long ago gave up the reins running the company.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.480]   So maybe that, you know, by the way, a couple of interesting.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.920]   Let's talk a little bit about his successor.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.960]   He also
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.400]   chose as chairman of the board.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.160]   He was going to resign from the board as well in a few months.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.480]   Chairman of the board is Brett Taylor, who is really one of the great people in
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.160]   Silicon Valley, I think former Google engineer.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:31.800]   He was at maps.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.240]   He was a Gmail started friend feed.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.760]   Not just a career.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.120]   I mean, a real creator and founder.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.480]   And I think an interesting person to put on the chairman of the board.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.880]   And let's talk about him and let's talk about Agro wall.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.880]   Good choice.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.680]   Good choice, says.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.760]   Thoughts I was surprised.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:00.640]   I was surprised that it was not Kavan who has been, you know, sort of the product
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.120]   head leading things.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.080]   I think Kavan was surprised, actually.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.720]   I've heard some some things.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.040]   But when you he did not quit, by the way, did not know.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:19.240]   When you do, you know, find out, because that's that's one of the things is that
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.200]   Agro wall was not very well known, even to those of us that follow this stuff all
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.560]   the time, because he didn't have a very big profile.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:32.320]   But when you read the details, he has been involved in basically every major
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.000]   important sort of iteration at Twitter for the last few years.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.880]   When Jack decides, hey, we're going in on the blockchain and Bitcoin.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:45.000]   Agro wall was the one that was that headed up that team the last few years as CTO
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.880]   and they're we're doing things like launching spaces and Twitter, blue and all
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.800]   that stuff, you know, he's he's the CTO that's in charge of all that stuff.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.840]   So it does make sense.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.000]   But then also, I think there was a lot of speculation and maybe this is more
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.400]   from Wall Street types that that we're like, well, what Twitter does need to do
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:09.040]   is maybe hire somebody from outside that would never use Twitter.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.280]   You know, like, like, you know, this didn't work out necessarily for Yahoo.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.800]   Remember with Yahoo brought in that Hollywood guy to like save it after the
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.040]   dot-com burst or something like that.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.240]   I feel like a lot of people thought that was going to happen too.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.400]   But if what you want is Twitter to continue firing on all the cylinders
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.320]   that's been firing on, I think Agro wall is a decent pick.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.520]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.600]   I agree with you, Mike, that Agro wall is
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   technical, but that's not where the problems lie with Twitter.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.440]   You need, I think, a guy with vision and strategy, don't you?
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.000]   Seems to me that he's a product guy and not a policy guy.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.720]   And I would prefer personally to have Twitter be run by a policy person,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.920]   somebody who really understands the all of the nuances and maybe he does.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.400]   I don't know. Well, you know, time will tell, but somebody who really has a passion
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:05.360]   for figuring out this, the biggest problem, which is fake accounts, bots,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.920]   trolls, harassment, how to allow free speech, but not hate speech.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.480]   How many problems? Yeah.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.840]   Yeah. And that's that's where Twitter,
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.360]   I think that's where Twitter is going to succeed or fail for its most passionate users.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.800]   It's not like how does the data center work?
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.920]   How many more how many more products can they throw into the mix?
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.120]   I personally, I mean, other than,
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.160]   you know, other than, well, actually, I can't think of any recent addition that
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.000]   they've made that's really changed the way I use Twitter.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.240]   I use it exactly the same as I did two, three years ago.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.360]   And I'm a really active user.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.840]   I just don't think all these new products, which may help in monetization and so on,
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.040]   are really what Twitter really are the things that make Twitter better.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.320]   I think Twitter make Twitter better is if they would get rid of all of those
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.880]   hundreds of thousands of fake bot driven, you know, figure out figure out that problem.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   I feel like Twitter has solved most of those problems.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.400]   I really do. I mean, I guess there's still a lot of bots on Twitter.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.080]   That might be one reason they don't count active users, but monetizable users instead.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.560]   You can't monetize a bot.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.160]   But I don't think that that's really a problem because the way most people use
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.840]   Twitter, they follow certain people.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.640]   And two days ago, they just or three days ago, they just removed 3500.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.480]   Yeah, they're going to keep doing that.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.640]   They're going to keep doing that.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.680]   I don't think that's a huge problem.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:34.440]   I think that they've saw that they've made themselves culturally important.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.360]   They've done a good job. I think it just announced another policy.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.440]   Actually, probably something Jack had been working on, but it was announced
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.200]   under Agrowal that they're going to and I think this is a big step.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:52.160]   They're going to prohibit the posting of media of private individuals, not not celebrities
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.120]   without the permission of the people depicted.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   That's an idea towards getting rid of harassment.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.600]   And I felt that the way that they rolled it out was a huge blunder.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.840]   One point and then I'll get to that.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.840]   OK, go ahead. The point is that in the US, everything is better on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.320]   The attention given to these issues is way better in the US.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.520]   But in the other 200 in something countries,
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:21.360]   depending on how small the country is sites like Twitter, Facebook, also WhatsApp
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:28.640]   and these other communications media are just having huge problems with fake news,
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.520]   causing riots.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.000]   See, I'm not aware of that.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.600]   Yeah, so I think that that's another issue.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:39.200]   But back to the rollout of this policy, the way they stated it.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.920]   And this happened immediately after the new CEO took charge.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.480]   It was like, oh, you know, it's like you can't.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.760]   We're banning the posting of private individuals.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.440]   Well, that's ridiculous.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.880]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.200]   Most pictures have people in the background.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.600]   They're not actually banning it.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.800]   What they're what they're actually doing is they're saying, OK, if someone complains,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.960]   that's me in that picture and I don't want myself, that's my pride.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.880]   That's me in a private situation.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.960]   They'll consider it.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.120]   That's really what they're talking about.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.080]   Yes.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.120]   And that's fair.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.360]   I mean, yeah, you don't want to just you can't automatically do it.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.640]   You have to wait. There's a complaint.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.520]   They do say that they're not going to remove stuff where the company tweet text
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.280]   is shared in the public interest or adds value of public discourse, even if it is a
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.880]   private individual, that would allow things like the George Floyd video to get
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.920]   through, even though he's not a celebrity, the police officers could perhaps say,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.640]   that I'm a private individual.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.120]   I don't want that image posted.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:41.960]   Except it's already been sort of weaponized by trolls where if Leo, you posted a picture of me,
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.320]   it's sort of like a takedown request.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   Oh, you could request they could request on your behalf.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.040]   Exactly.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.680]   So if I wanted to screw your account and you posted a picture of me on your Twitter
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.400]   account, all I have to do is file the complaint.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.720]   And then like on YouTube with the DCMA or whatever, take down request.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:05.280]   Yeah. And it's on you to spend the next few weeks fighting to get your account back.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.320]   It's not on me because all I had to do was rat you out.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.800]   Well, the white supremacists are already all over this.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:18.120]   And they're actually organizing around this idea that one of the whole bunch of anti
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:25.840]   white supremacy, anti-racist organizations who who show people waving swastikas
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   and stuff and shame them. And that's part of what they do in their work.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.720]   But Twitter has preserved their capability of moderating that and saying,
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.400]   no, that's public discourse.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.800]   So they've given themselves an out after removing those accounts and then putting
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.840]   them back. Well, that depends.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.120]   Have we seen that they're immediately taking them down?
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.080]   I mean, is there an incident?
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   I believe somewhere actually taken down.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.760]   OK, so there is an instant takedown.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.600]   That's perhaps something they want to change.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.320]   This is the reporting form on Twitter.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.680]   And you can you can say the information belongs to me,
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.720]   someone I'm authorized to represent or someone else.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.560]   I guess if if I said me,
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.680]   I would have to provide my own Twitter information and I would have to sign it.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.480]   And by the way, they they say electronically sign this notice by typing your full name.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.040]   So that perhaps has some legal power.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.720]   I think they're trying to look at their their obviously go try to try to do.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   I'm just right.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   I'm just my complaint is easily game.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.920]   That's not good, obviously.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:32.360]   As a writer and editor, why can't Twitter write a clear tweet or a clear policy?
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.720]   I have it was the tweet I have a policy problem with it.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.400]   Yeah, it caused an entire cause, you know, millions of people in entire day arguing
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.840]   about what it means and freaking out and all this kind of stuff when they could
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.920]   have just written a they could have written an unambiguous tweet and I write.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.680]   Yeah, I'm willing to give the new CEO a little bit more time to get their feet
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.320]   underneath them.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.440]   I don't expect them to be perfect from day one.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.600]   I think everything that Mike is talking about is totally fair and valid,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.520]   but I just want to let him breathe for a couple of weeks and see how this goes out.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.880]   It just happens again.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.160]   Gosh.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.120]   But I don't think Jack made a mistake in picking or I don't think he made a quick
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.400]   choice in this decision and also like keep in mind we have also had how we liked
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.000]   Twitter's product choices in the last six, twelve months.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.120]   Well, Brett Taylor was on the board that entire time and now he's chairman of the
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.520]   board or will be.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.600]   So there's going to be some continuity of leadership there from the reason there.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.000]   So maybe that will help see them through some of the more sticky questions and
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.880]   product choices. I hope so at least as a Twitter fanboy.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.680]   The best headline came from the onion.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.800]   Self important a hole making big show about leaving Twitter.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.640]   Who has it? Who has it?
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.600]   I didn't say that.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.880]   That's amazing.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.240]   Oh my gosh.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.800]   Can we talk about Jack's beard and how it needs to go because Jack is a handsome boy
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.960]   and he's wearing this like ZZ.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.240]   It's just it's only good when he's in front of Congress.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.200]   Otherwise, it was fantastic when he was testifying for Congress.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.400]   It was like so good.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.800]   It just did not one of these things is not like the other.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.160]   Let's take a little break because I do.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.640]   I mean, the next thing, let's talk about block.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.320]   Let's talk about web three, whatever the hell that is.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.800]   I think I have a pretty good crew here to explain that to me.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.120]   We will get back to a very good panel.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   I think we'll have a very good panel.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.720]   We'll have a complete return to normality.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   Good luck.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.920]   Good luck.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.120]   But yeah, it's going to be awesome.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.320]   Perseco and then Provence.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.920]   I was very nervous because I hadn't traveled internationally since the COVID started.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.320]   But it worked out really well.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.720]   We all got tested before we left.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.920]   Everybody was negative, which is positive.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.120]   It was very positive that we were negative.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.720]   We took another test before we left.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.520]   That was a very positive negative.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.320]   And as you saw, as you saw, Leo,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.520]   you can tell that Wahawk has a great place during a pandemic.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.120]   There's a lot of open space.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.920]   Restaurants are outside.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   Everybody wears a mask.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.120]   Every restaurant has an as outdoor seating.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.720]   It was really great.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.520]   Fantastic.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.520]   Our show today brought to you by Egg Knight.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.920]   We're really thrilled to have Egg Knight on the network.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:39.520]   All over the world, these days, you know, companies hit by ransomware attacks.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   Their digital files are held hostage.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.520]   They have to decide, do we pay these crooks to get them back?
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.120]   That's just got a stink.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.920]   You don't have to say, oh, I'm not to pay these guys.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:56.120]   On average, even if you do pay them, it takes 23 days to recover.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.920]   So no matter what, that's 23 days of disruption of downtime of chaos.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.320]   And that could be a problem.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.720]   City of Atlanta, remember, was shut down for five days.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.520]   The whole city shut down for five days in 2018.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.200]   Ransomware can come for any company in any industry, but small to medium sized
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.800]   businesses, we get hurt the worst.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.520]   We have fewer cyber defenses.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.720]   Ransomware has more ways to sneak through.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.920]   And frankly, it can put us out of business with smaller teams,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.120]   small companies usually slower to recover.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.200]   And of course, for those companies in particular, the downtime and reputational
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.320]   damage can be devastating egg.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:39.120]   E-G-N-Y-T-E is the first ever file system.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.920]   This is so clever.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.520]   The first ever file system with sophisticated ransomware detection
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.520]   and recovery tools fully built in.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:53.120]   It lets your teams create and share documents in Microsoft 365 or Google Docs
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.320]   or Slack or Salesforce or DocuSign and countless others still keeping your
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.120]   company's data safe.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.520]   And you know, I know one of the reasons people aren't secure is because most
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   of the security software has a terrible user experience.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.120]   Not true with Ignite.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.000]   It's a team.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.520]   It's a tool your team will actually love using.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.720]   And because ransomware detection and mitigation run in the background, you
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.000]   don't even have to think about it.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.320]   You'll you'll work without disruption.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   It's just efficient in the background and it's getting the job done behind the
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:23.960]   scenes.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.520]   Ignite gives companies with limited IT and security staff the power of much
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.840]   larger teams.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.920]   You're going to get total visibility.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.320]   It's exactly where your key documents are.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.520]   And this is very important.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.520]   You'll know who has access.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.720]   And I love this.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.920]   It can automatically detect more than 2000 ransomware variants.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.320]   It'll flag unusual behavior as well.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.920]   It's completely turnkey.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.920]   You don't have any onsite hardware or software.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.720]   You shut down compromised accounts, quickly identify and restore encrypted
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.120]   files all from a single cloud based platform.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.320]   And forget 23 days to get back to work.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.920]   Recovery is almost instant.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.120]   If ransomware does sneak through, you can restore your files fast.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.200]   You'll be back up and running in hours without having to pay one penny to those
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.800]   schmucks.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.160]   Ransomware attacks are inevitable.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.400]   They're going to happen, but losing your valuable data is not the right
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.560]   preparation is everything with ignite.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.240]   You won't need a specialized security ops team to keep up.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.040]   The system is always learning, always adapting to new threats.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.320]   Your team does business as they always have.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.360]   And you can rest easy.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.520]   I love this solution.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.520]   And more about how ignite EGNYTE can protect your business from ransomware.

[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.320]   Speaking of smart, I am not smart enough to know what the hell they're talking
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.520]   about with web three.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.920]   Not by the way, not web 3.0.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.520]   No space.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.320]   Very important that you do this right.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   I bet you Alex Wilhelm can explain what the hell web three is.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   I'm going to show you this headline.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   Actually, this tweet from Elon Musk.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:32.120]   Web three sounds like BS tweets, Elon Musk.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.920]   Yes.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.720]   So Leo, thank you for putting me in the hot seat on this one because that we all
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.920]   get all the tweets and not you.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.520]   Better you than me, buddy.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.520]   No, I appreciate that.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:48.120]   Web three is a rebrand of blockchain, which was a rebrand crypto.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.720]   I think it's the simplest way to put it.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.320]   It's broadening each time because cryptocurrencies were originally just, you
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.720]   know, Bitcoin and Litecoin back in the early days.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.120]   And then we talked more about blockchain thinking about the broader
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   crypto economy in a larger sense.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.920]   What else can we build with blockchain technology?
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:08.120]   Web three encompasses NFTs and kind of like the games you can play on the
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   Ethereum chain and so forth.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.320]   And so I think it's a broader term, but it is mostly the same stuff.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.920]   But I will say there was a shift overnight.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.720]   Sometime a few months ago, Web three became the thing to say and I don't know
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.720]   quite what changed, but all of a sudden it became what people use to describe
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.320]   the larger world of Bitcoin at all.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:32.320]   So if you want to sound cool, say Web three and by cool, I mean, not cool.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.520]   If it sounds like a rebranding of the original vision of the Internet,
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.640]   which is no borders, no controls, everybody just does everything that they
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.520]   want and there's no governments.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:43.920]   Can that work?
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.320]   That works so well.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   And then that didn't happen.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.720]   It was, you know, argue, you know, the Internet was largely taken over by giant
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.520]   corporations.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.720]   And so this is an attempt to get back to that original vision.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.320]   Nobody's nobody characterizes like that, but it's clearly that's what it is.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:05.520]   Taking the basket of hot new technologies like blockchain NFTs and lumping in
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.520]   Meta if you were lumping in the Metaverse, et cetera.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.520]   Don't forget the Metaverse.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.920]   You get this new world, which is the original vision of the Internet.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.520]   But Mike, it's claims to be so punk rock, right?
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.920]   What you just said is so dead on.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.520]   It claims to be this this open freewheeling place.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.840]   And yet it seems that the same people who made a bunch of money on Internet's one
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.320]   and two are making all the money in Web 3.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.520]   So to me, like, are they just failing to live up to that kind of punkie?
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.920]   Those who are describing or is or by misreading where things are today, technologically.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:42.400]   I just I just think that's there's a technology type people are into that sort
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.520]   of thing is that somebody in your door that's that's my Alex.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.320]   Sorry about that.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.720]   She really wants in.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   Are you in her playroom?
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   I'm sort of.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.920]   Yes, you've taken over your your granddaughter's playroom.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.720]   And now she wants in.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.920]   She's pounding on the door much as many people want to get into Web 3 point.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:12.120]   It's not 3.0, by the way, W.E.B. 3.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.320]   Let's get that right.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:18.720]   OK, I've heard people in the media call it Web 3.0 because it was Web 2.0.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.800]   But no, no, no, that would just be a successor to Web 2.0.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.920]   This is nothing like Web 2.0.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:28.080]   This is Web 3, except for the fact, Leo, that it's literally all the same stuff
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.440]   from Web 2.0 on the blockchain.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:34.360]   It's games, it's social, it's, it's, you know, like different interest groups
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.920]   around different cultural means.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:43.720]   Am I old out of touch or dumb to every time I hear the word blockchain?
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.720]   Think, watch out.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.720]   Watch your wallet. This sounds a little bit like a pyramid scheme to me.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.520]   Leo, you heard of Axie Infinity, the chance?
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.720]   No, what's that? OK.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.120]   Well, there's a lot of these these pay to earn games or start play to earn.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.920]   So like you kind of play them and then you earn tokens that are then have some sort
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.920]   of monetary value.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.720]   And that always strikes me as slightly skeevy.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:12.520]   And then also there's a lot of ways to like essentially loan your crypto cats.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.120]   It's kind of kind of.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.440]   It's closer.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.720]   Alex, isn't it closer to like essentially
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:25.200]   Pokemon kind of like, but do you like money characters and you fight them or
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.880]   something, but then you earn money?
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.120]   Yeah, I do. Yeah.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.440]   But where does all the money come from?
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.920]   Because usually in my experience as a longtime gamer, I pay money.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.440]   Right. And then I play versus I play and then I get paid.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.640]   That sounds like work and yet it's a game.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.520]   And so to Leo's point about just having a general sense of unease,
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.920]   that's how I feel because as far as I'm concerned, there is no never
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.120]   an infinite font of capital.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.200]   There is no way to make money for free forever.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.360]   So from whence does it come?
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.040]   But no, but there is because
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.000]   you know, I mean, people always get mad at the Federal Reserve for creating more
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.560]   money, but there's nothing to stop us from creating more cryptocurrency.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.800]   Leo, you might feel more skeevy about
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.600]   actually infinity specifically when you find out that the majority of the players
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:18.280]   are in the Philippines and that what happens is rich Westerners higher.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.360]   To grind to grind to them.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.200]   Right. Yeah.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:27.440]   Now there's they're making more than they would at a in-meat space job.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:33.240]   But apparently like 90 percent of the active players are in the Philippines
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:38.680]   right now, even though a lot of that money is flowing to bigger wallets elsewhere.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:46.080]   So I'm just setting up my XC account and I have to get a Ronan wallet and I have
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:51.120]   to deposit Ethereum or Ether into my Ronan wallet.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.360]   So I am paying to play. Yes.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.160]   And don't forget that's going to cost you several hundred dollars in gas fees.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.000]   These transfer to your wallet.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.360]   I never heard the phrase gas fees until Constitution DAO.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.320]   This is down.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.920]   I've been saying down and then I thought, Oh, I should probably say DAO since it is an acronym.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.440]   Also, no one says Ether.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.120]   Everyone says if I know it's a web three, no space and down.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:24.760]   So you're saying I'm basically marking myself as a future sucker and that yes,
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.120]   you are marking yourself as a mark.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.760]   I'm a mark.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   I'm wearing the sucker hat when we were in Mexico many years ago on the beach in
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.320]   the West, Gondido and beautiful Oaxaca.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:42.040]   Met vendors came down selling hats, one of which was made from palm leaves.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:47.880]   It was a very cute hat and my ex at the time with my wife bought it, Jennifer bought it.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.520]   And I said, Jennifer, you just bought the sucker hat.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   Now, everybody coming down the beach is going to make a beeline to you because you
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.400]   just gave somebody $10 for some palm fronds.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:03.160]   So you're saying to me that I'm wearing the sucker hat when I say Constitution DAO
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.560]   or Ether.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.120]   Yes, but the good news is Leo, you don't have a lot of your personal net worth in
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:08.960]   crypto assets.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.480]   I have none.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.160]   I think you're probably.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:10.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.960]   I do have that wallet with 7.85 Bitcoin.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.160]   But thank God, I can't get into it.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:20.600]   Alex, Alex, wait till he finds out that good morning is a very, very loaded acronym.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.160]   Good morning.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.560]   GM, baby.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.760]   GM.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:29.560]   I say GM, you say GM back because apparently the crypto meme world in culture is rooted
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.360]   in middle school terror.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.760]   What does it mean?
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.360]   Good morning.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.160]   But if you're in the crypto, no, you say GM back.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.960]   It's this like weird shibblest.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:42.880]   Oh, it's a handshake.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.960]   It's a secret handshake.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.760]   Oh, OK.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.960]   And we're all going to make it or we're not going to make it.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.160]   There's there's a flag me.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.360]   But right, right, right.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.760]   Let me to give them their credit.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:00.120]   One of the things that you have to say about the Web3 crowd is that now they're
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:05.720]   very eager and excited, but generally they're very optimistic and friendly.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.920]   So, you know, their secret handshake is literally good morning.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:09.520]   Good morning.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   All going to make it.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.320]   Good morning.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.320]   It's what Tim Cook says at the beginning of her apple event.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.320]   Good morning.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:15.720]   Jeez.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:19.120]   But if you want to say you're in the know, you say GM.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.320]   GM, which I presume comes from texting, right?
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.720]   ROTFL.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.320]   WUT, right?
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.720]   It's maybe.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.320]   I don't know.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.720]   I don't think that's right.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.840]   But I do think Brian's point is great, though, because no one is having more
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.840]   fun than the crypto kit.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.520]   They're having like, yeah, I mean, they're having an absolute blast.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.720]   Like do I want this week?
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.920]   Yeah, not this weekend because of the sell off, but like I'm never going to spend
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:50.120]   $10,000 on an NFT because I don't want to purchase the digital signature to a
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.720]   particular image on one blockchain.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.120]   Doesn't really drive my buttons, but they're having an absolute blast.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.920]   They're making room.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.120]   So, you know, the next thing you're going to do is you're going to make money on
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.120]   this stuff, right?
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.920]   You have to be bullish.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.720]   There's no bears in the crypto world.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:11.920]   Well, I've well, can you show it sell crypto?
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:16.320]   Probably, but I've written mean things about Bitcoin off and on for since 2013.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.720]   I got for you.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.320]   Poorly people have been crossed for a long time with me.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.920]   But online money is an index fund.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:28.320]   This is the problem, by the way, with any pyramid scheme or any other scam is the
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.320]   most threatening people are the people who don't believe it.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.720]   You want to you know, you got to beat them down because it's all based on this
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.320]   optimism.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:39.320]   We're going to get rich philosophy and anybody who doesn't is, you know, is peeing
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.520]   in your chowder.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:47.120]   Alex, you would know this better than me because you cover the VC space closer
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.320]   than I do, but my theory is that and this is going to be something that's we
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.720]   don't know about also, but I think you said show is full of that, by the way.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.120]   Go ahead.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:57.320]   Why?
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:02.520]   A few months ago, did web three suddenly become the saying and my theory is
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.920]   that that it's literally Chris Dixon.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.720]   It's literally Andreessen Horowitz.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.120]   It's literally VCs.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:14.120]   Yeah, decided on mass to brand it this way and my motivating theory for that is
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:19.920]   they made so much money from Solana that all the sudden, especially Andreessen,
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.320]   a lot of the VCs are like, we need more Solanas.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.520]   So let me explain a couple of things about what Brian just said.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.320]   I think it's pretty good.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.520]   So first of all, Chris Dixon and Mark Andreessen have both blocked me on
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:31.920]   Twitter.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.520]   I just I don't know why that matters, but I wanted to bring it up.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:41.920]   I just want to say I am so way ahead of you in 1993 on MSNBC.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.920]   I told the world when Microsoft and NASA Internet Explorer 3.0, it's all
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.120]   over for Mozilla.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.620]   It's all over for Netscape.
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:54.920]   They're charging for a browser Microsoft's giving away and Mark Andreessen apparently
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:01.220]   at that point began a longstanding hatred of me because I told the truth.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.620]   By the way, I was absolutely right.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:07.220]   Yeah, I was told later he came screaming down the halls at Netscape saying,
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.720]   who is this Leo Leport?
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.620]   Who is this all?
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.520]   Well, I was like, join in the club.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.820]   Join the club, Alex.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:19.320]   Yeah, I'm always like you Leo and marks never like us.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.320]   And that's fine.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.220]   But what I'll say is the Solana example that Brian brings up is actually a great
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.920]   point because Solana is a is a blockchain.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.120]   It has some similarities to the Ethereum blockchain.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.520]   It is better in some technological ways.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.220]   It is cheaper to execute transactions.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.520]   They're often faster.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.920]   And as a piece of technology, frankly, it's kind of cool.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.220]   It shows the evolution of blockchains from Bitcoin to Ether.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.920]   Ethereum to I would say is Solana and some other ones do like maybe polka dot.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.320]   I don't know.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.720]   There's a couple of options out there.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.620]   But I think if you look at the initial token distribution of Solana and I'm
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:53.420]   pulling back to my memory here, so if I get this a little bit wrong, don't jump on me.
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:57.220]   I think a lot of the early backers got a bunch of early tokens and that I've
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.520]   appreciated very, very well.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:02.420]   And so the people that invested in it, I think was injuries and Horowitz or maybe
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:04.920]   their crypto fund made out like bandits.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.520]   And so that was my point earlier about the same people that already have money making
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.420]   the bulk of the money in the crypto space.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.720]   And that's why I'm not that interested today.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:15.020]   It's not bringing economic prosperity to poor people, right?
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:18.420]   So you could actually argue it might even be doing the opposite.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.820]   It's, I mean, it's not good for the environment.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.520]   It's not good for cybersecurity.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   It's, you know, Bitcoin is the main is one of the things that makes ransomware
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.320]   work the way it does.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.920]   My well, first I have a comment about Alex's watch.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.920]   I've never seen anybody wear the watch on their hand.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.720]   Let me see Alex doing.
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.220]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:46.320]   So basically everyone, if you're not watching the video, I'm wearing my Apple
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:46.820]   watch around.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.420]   You have a boo boo on your hand that you're covering up.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:53.720]   I do not have a boo boo nor do I have a cut.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.420]   I'm just kind of a twitchy boy.
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.220]   And so I play with my watch when I'm sitting around.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.120]   And if I, yeah, it's not easy.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.020]   He's a risk model and he has to protect his risk.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.920]   The risk at all costs.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.320]   Yes.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.320]   I just like to call out any sort of innovation I see no matter what it is.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:14.920]   But in terms of cryptocurrency, the thing that bothers me is whenever I say
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:21.220]   something that's vaguely negative about about any of this stuff, I get the argument
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:24.020]   is that, oh no, this is a great currency.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.220]   It's for purchasing things and it's really not used that way.
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:27.520]   Is it?
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.020]   I mean, it's not to.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.420]   The value will go up.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:35.420]   The people buying things with it regret it deeply like the guy about the, what is the $100,000 pizza.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:36.420]   Exactly.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:43.920]   The thing that, and I'm probably wrong about this and I probably will be proved wrong over time because I don't, I don't look at it that carefully.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:51.820]   But it seems to me that this is a place where you can invest money and then make money without really contributing to society.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.020]   Yeah, it's beyond employing anyone without making anything.
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:58.820]   It's like the whole thing kind of bothers me, but I'm probably just going to take that.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:59.820]   I don't think so.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.220]   I think that's exactly what it is.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:06.020]   And I think a lot of the enthusiasm is for coming from people who speculated successfully
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:10.220]   and was with any pyramid scheme, you got to pull in new people because, you know,
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.820]   that's what keeps it going.
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:12.820]   That's where the growth comes from.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.620]   It keeps it floating.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:20.420]   To bring it back real quick to the original question of what Web3 is and Alex helped me out here because I feel like maybe we're the closest.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.820]   The difference.
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.720]   So, so Mike is talking about currencies and things like that.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:30.220]   The way I understand it is Web3 is moving crypto beyond just the idea.
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:36.020]   Satoshi is a original idea of something that can replace money to essentially being the person.
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:45.220]   The promise that's always been there for utopian folks of a global computer where it's not just money that is digitized.
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.020]   It's contracts.
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.220]   It's gaming.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.620]   It's all of these things.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:59.020]   It's moving towards the metaverse where your NFT is going to be your image that you present to the world when you're in the metaverse and things like that.
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:05.940]   And so it I think Web3, the people that are proponents of Web3 think that this is the
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.940]   next evolution beyond just, oh, what's this new coin?
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:15.340]   It's what's this new thing that allows computing to happen natively on the internet.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:15.940]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.940]   And the question this cuts at and this is why it's interesting.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:35.780]   Even if you're not a active spectator in current crypto coins is is the internet and the future of technology better distributed and therefore slower, more expensive, the more censorship resistant or centralized Allah AWS Azure and the other major cloud platforms or DocuSign for
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.580]   contracts, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:46.500]   My question is the decentralized world can only really kick the butt of the centralized world if it can provide what large companies need.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:51.780]   And if you've ever talked to a company like Ignite who was in the ad, I know that company for a thousand years and doesn't see you for a while too.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:59.340]   They have to build stuff like single sign on and provide uptime guarantees to their customers to get them to use their service.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:04.180]   Blockchain and DIOs are having gotten close to kind of that level.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.140]   I believe they're called Dows.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:06.980]   I've learned that.
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.780]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.740]   This is why this is why I shouldn't come on to it because I was caught on myself.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.420]   I'm not so good.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:20.740]   So I look, I think the central technology of blockchain is actually really interesting.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:29.460]   The idea that it's decentralized, that it's secure, that no one, you know, the financial system has as currently constituted.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:34.100]   It's centralized in banks, you know, national banks, central banks.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.580]   Immutable ledger so that in theory it can't be messed with.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.940]   It can't be messed with.
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:43.740]   There is a privacy component, although, you know, that can vary depending on how it's implemented.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.740]   I think that's all very positive.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:52.260]   I'm not sure why the web needs to be running on on blockchain.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.980]   I don't understand the benefit of that exactly.
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.340]   But, you know, I, you know, it's interesting.
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.180]   How's it going in El Salvador?
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:05.500]   That sounds like a real non sequitur, but of course El Salvador is now using blockchain.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:11.140]   They must be really happy this weekend using Bitcoin as their currency, their national currency.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.940]   They must be so thrilled, right?
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:19.140]   I've seen all the stories, but I've never seen stories about actual ordinary Salvadorans.
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.940]   It sounds like hyperinflation.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.580]   This is what happened to the Weimar Republic.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.860]   I have, oh, I'm so excited.
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:29.940]   I've taken all my dollars because they used to be on the dollar system, US dollars.
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.660]   So I had $100,000.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:35.660]   I put it in the bank, converted it to Bitcoin.
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:37.940]   I got one and a half bitcoins for it.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.060]   And now they're worth $20,000.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:46.340]   There is nothing to celebrate, but it's secure and decentralized.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:47.180]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.900]   I mean, it's bad for money.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:52.340]   Let's just say it that's a different, you know, and that's another argument.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:58.220]   I want to replace government run fiat currencies with some sort of mathematical
[00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.660]   equation run fiat currencies.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.900]   That's a different conversation.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.700]   But the underlying technology, blockchain, that's I think that's kind of interesting.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.180]   I mean, I could see some uses for it.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.580]   Fundamentally, I agree with you.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.340]   And this is why I'm never going to be fully dismissive of it, though I will be
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:18.500]   critical of certain actions, certain coins, certain projects, whatever.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.300]   But like fundamentally, technology has been driven by optimism and people being
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.900]   to tear up the prior rule sheet and start again.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:29.460]   And maybe it'll eventually become true that the promise of Web3 or call it,
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.780]   which we will will bear out.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:34.500]   But today, transfer wise is doing fine in the money movement space.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.620]   So it hasn't killed off traditional ways of handling
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.260]   remittances, which was one of the original promises.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.820]   It might be a better way to do it.
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.980]   Down the road, right?
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.540]   Maybe.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.380]   It certainly hasn't killed off art.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.780]   It hasn't killed off gaming.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.420]   I mean, what it has done is captivated people that are interested in making quite
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:48.980]   a lot of money.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.940]   And that's fine.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:54.700]   But that isn't the world changing thing that we often hear people discuss
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:55.940]   when they talk about Web3.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:00.500]   And I would love to see more income equality, more economic distribution.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.340]   The things that are the higher level promises of what blockchain is supposed
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:08.700]   to become, that's what I'm interested in much less today's NFT meant, for example.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:14.700]   By the way, obviously, the president of El Salvador is all into buying the dip
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.020]   because when Bitcoin dropped, President
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:24.420]   Kayleigh bought 150 more great investment opportunity for El Salvador.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:27.900]   That's not going to solve the GDP issues there in the corruption and the
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.380]   gang violence is buying more Bitcoin.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.700]   I'm more Bitcoin.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.660]   Well, at least he bought it a low.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:34.860]   Will it be a record low?
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.300]   I don't know.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.100]   I think it's also very we're going to take a break.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:43.300]   But I think it's also very interesting that venture capitalists have invested
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:49.860]   $27 billion this year in Bitcoin more than all previous 10 years combined.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:55.100]   That'll give you some idea of the acceleration of not Bitcoin alone, but crypto in general.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.780]   That'll give you some idea and it's a gold rush.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.460]   It's a gold rush.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:03.900]   And when you see Staples Arena, rename crypto.com arena, when you see
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:08.900]   the F1 race with crypto.com all over all the cars, I was just watching the world
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:15.420]   this championship even there, you see FTX, you see crypto everywhere because
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.220]   well, the money is.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:23.980]   But that doesn't mean to me that it's necessarily important in the sense that's
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.500]   going to change the world, right?
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.580]   But those advertisements are for crypto exchanges, essentially the gateway
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.460]   between the fiat world and the blockchain world.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.900]   And they're not decentralized.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:35.900]   They're not dows.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.980]   They're just traditionally run corporations that have
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.260]   rich in documents where you expect them to exist.
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.060]   So are those really like blockchain companies or are those just normal companies
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:48.300]   aping their way like a more serious crypto company?
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.860]   Coinbase makes money from fees.
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.540]   Right. Banks have been doing like a bank.
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.420]   It's the dawn of time.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:52.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.540]   Just like currency exchange, you know,
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.700]   travel X, they're the travel X of crypto.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.980]   And in fact, when you talk about native crypto, like constitution,
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.780]   Dow, there you go.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.100]   And then go all that well.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.260]   Not only did they not get the printed constitution, the printed copy of the
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:14.300]   constitution, they lost their bid to hedge fund billionaire
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:18.660]   who was the guy who bailed out coin coin.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:24.260]   Robin Robin Hood, by the way, Leo, as an example of how hopeful all of these
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:29.380]   folks are we had about six members of the Constitution Dow on our show last weekend.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.580]   And they were nothing but like, man, this is awesome.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:36.540]   You know, like we were talking to them, I guess, 48 hours after they lost.
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:41.580]   And why were they bullish because you have to be bullish?
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:42.980]   Right.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:47.660]   They were taking the position of, can you believe we did all this in a week?
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.420]   It didn't work out.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:53.260]   Can you believe the gas he's made away almost every single donation?
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:56.060]   Who made the money on Constitution Dow?
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.460]   The gas, gas, the gas, the miners.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.860]   Sorry. Ethereum miners.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.460]   I'm going to call it ETH, but I might be wrong.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.300]   The what do we call it?
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.940]   Again, I'm just going to go cry now.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:17.380]   I go to Constitution D AO and all the money was made by the Ethereum gas fee
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.980]   monitors.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.500]   That I mean, they could kill.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.100]   That's legitimately the reason why I didn't contribute because I wanted to put
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:29.300]   in a hundred dollars and at the time because gas fees vary by the hour, which is
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.540]   another great thing about it.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:35.180]   It would cost me a hundred and forty five dollars to contribute my one hundred dollars.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:35.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:40.260]   Not only do you not know what your crypto is worth at any given point in time, you
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.460]   don't know what it's going to cost to even buy or sell it.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:49.500]   Yeah, I tried to buy an NFT and by the time I put my $50 on Coinbase, moved it to
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.220]   MetaMask and then brought it to OpenSea, which is an NFT exchange.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.700]   I couldn't afford the gas fees to buy a free NFT.
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.420]   So now it's like this is not an improvement.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.740]   I believe this is still the first podcast that was minted as an NFT.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.700]   But back in March, I minted a podcast.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.940]   It's an NFT.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:07.300]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.500]   Now I have 10 copies available.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.900]   I've sold two, so there's eight remaining, but I haven't sold anymore because
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:18.340]   after the fees, even if someone offers me the equivalent of a hundred dollars, I
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.300]   lose money if I sell it.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.020]   You lose money.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.220]   Yes.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.340]   So welcome to Web 3.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.780]   It's like Visa, but way worse and you have to pay.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.100]   I appreciate you doing the experiment, Brian.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.620]   That's that was a good experiment.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.020]   We've all learned something vice did the same thing.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.220]   I think they tried to donate two hundred dollars to Constitution.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:45.180]   Now, by the time it got there and got back with the refund, they've lost money
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:46.260]   on the whole thing.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:52.340]   So yeah, I mean, yeah, you know, to buy or be where?
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:56.780]   Although this I have to say this axi infinity looks like a lot of fun.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.860]   It's popular.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.500]   I mean, people like to play Pokemon.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.060]   Pokemon's a big game for a reason.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.020]   It's still popular.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.820]   I played Pokemon cards when I was in elementary school.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.140]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:06.580]   And it's still a big deal.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.660]   Yeah, you know, it's staying power.
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.660]   I saved all my beanie babies from the 90s.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.060]   I hope someday I will be rich.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.180]   Our show today, let's take a little break.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.260]   We'll come back lots more to talk about.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.220]   Our show today brought to you by Stripe.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.420]   I love this.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:29.180]   The complete payments solution.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:29.900]   And yes, you can.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.380]   I believe you can pay in crypto with Stripe.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.500]   Stripe actually supports and we use Stripe.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.700]   One of the reasons we use it is Stripe supports a hundred and thirty five
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.100]   different currencies and payment methods.
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.860]   It is the payment platform.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.260]   No question about it.
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:47.980]   That's why leaders of adaptive businesses, businesses on the move.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.580]   Choose Stripe as their payment platform with Stripe.
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.140]   Your business can easily optimize your payments infrastructure,
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:58.660]   simplify expansion plans, create new revenue streams, all to help you grow
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.700]   and initiate change rather than having to react to it.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:05.220]   That's why Shopify uses Stripe and Postmates and Twilio.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.500]   They all look to Stripe to power their global payments.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.900]   And one of the things and I didn't really know much about this until we started
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:13.340]   taking Stripe for Club Twit.
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:19.620]   But one of the problems in general with taking credit cards or payment systems
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.420]   is authorization rates.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:27.460]   You can really lose a lot of purchases with a low authorization rate.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:32.460]   Twilio increased its authorization rates by 10 percent with Stripe.
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:37.540]   They actually did an A/B test with multiple global payment processors, Stripe one easily.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.420]   And to give you an idea of how much difference this can make,
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:47.220]   Stripe helped Postmates generate over $70 million in revenue by increasing their
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.660]   authorization rates.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.100]   That is important.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.060]   Stripe is easy to use once you integrate it.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:56.500]   There's single platform world-class stocks allow businesses to easily experiment
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:00.020]   like an A/B test to scale to grow revenue.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:04.220]   Stripe processes billions of dollars each year for every kind and every size of
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.580]   business from pre-seeds startups to Fortune 500 companies.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.540]   And they're always improving the platform.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.540]   I'm always impressed.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.860]   Hundreds of new features and improvements every year.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:14.860]   So you will keep up with the industry.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.500]   You'll stay ahead and man is it reliable.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.820]   Five nines of API uptime.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:26.700]   They handle more than 250 million, a quarter of a billion API requests every single day.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.940]   We launch club Twit this year on Stripe.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.540]   That's our payment platform.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.060]   We're very happy.
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.540]   It's easy for our customers, our listeners.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.420]   It's seamless and accepting payments.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.180]   We don't like to issue refunds.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:44.260]   We don't have to, but when we do, it's very easy.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.420]   We couldn't be happier.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:49.620]   And with all those currencies, it means we're truly global, which is
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.860]   important to us.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.460]   We're able to focus on the business of making these shows while Stripe handles the
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.420]   business of payments and money movement.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.540]   That's just how I like it.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.780]   I also like this and you should, if you're a Stripe customer, flip this switch.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.580]   Stripe climate.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:07.020]   You can direct a fraction of your revenue to help scale emerging carbon
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.340]   removal technologies.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.620]   You might want to turn that on.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.780]   So whether you're an online or in person retailer, software, platform, marketplace,
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.260]   or a subscriptions business like ours,

[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:32.020]   Ah, OK.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:36.420]   I'm sure the Bitcoin bros are going to say, well, I see why Leo's
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.380]   all against Bitcoin.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.580]   He takes credit codes.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.380]   Let's see.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.580]   What else?
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:47.100]   There was some money spent, but not a lot on Cyber Monday and Black Friday.
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.780]   We had the Black Friday report last weekend.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:55.340]   Cyber Monday sales dropped 1.4 percent from an already slow year last year.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.940]   10.7 billion.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.020]   That's the first time ever.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:06.100]   Alex, you say this is evidence that e-commerce growth is slowing.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:11.140]   So critical phrasing there, e-commerce growth is slowing, not that e-commerce is
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:15.380]   in decline, but we did see, I think it was year over year declines in digital
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:18.740]   sales for Black Friday and then also slight declines in Cyber Monday sales.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:23.140]   Did it go up a lot last year because of COVID and is it now just kind of normalizing?
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:23.700]   Is that why?
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:27.780]   That's why broader thesis about all of this because like a lot of folks, I've
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.180]   spent much of the last two years at home, which means I've already bought all
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.260]   the stuff from my house.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:33.260]   I could possibly want.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.540]   We got a new dishwasher.
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:38.180]   You know, we bought Sonos and so like now my house is pretty kidded out.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.260]   I have a home gym now.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:44.060]   And so when Cyber Monday comes on or Black Friday, I'm like, oh, I'm actually
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.420]   done. I've completed all that stuff.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.220]   And so I wonder if there's just is it also possible?
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.140]   I think this might be maybe a part of it.
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.300]   I noticed we're doing this.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.140]   We're buying more locally.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:58.180]   It's a little more expensive sometimes, but it's certainly less convenient.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.940]   But we want to support our local merchants because we're terrified.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:03.060]   They're going to all disappear.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.660]   Because yes, very much so, right?
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.180]   All their restaurants are closing for sure.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.740]   I'm worried a lot of stores downtown are closing.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.580]   So I wonder if people are also saying maybe we should buy,
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:15.380]   spend our money locally.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.780]   We turn to the books.
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:19.380]   There's a book store in Providence called Books on the Square.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.860]   And we're trying to do most of our book buying there because we don't want them to go away.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.180]   They have a great children's book section.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.020]   We want to have kids.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.540]   I want that to be there when I have children.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.540]   Every dollar you call books on the world.
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:31.220]   Amazon doesn't get puts on the block.
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.940]   Yeah, you can use your teeth there.
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.980]   You know, these don't have any thing.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:40.020]   It's actually worse than I think it's worse than it sounds because one of the
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:45.900]   strange phenomenon that happened during COVID and continued to happen is that people
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:51.740]   have shifted their purchasing from services to some degree to products.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:52.300]   Right.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:55.740]   So travel services, people are traveling a lot less.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:59.580]   All the things that people do for business travel, business travel is way down.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:04.060]   So, you know, services in general,
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:09.020]   the kinds of services you can't take advantage of during a pandemic are down and people
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:09.860]   are buying products.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:15.380]   And so if you're looking at declines in what are essentially products on e-commerce,
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:18.820]   it's going to be even worse once the pandemic is over because I think there's
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:25.220]   going to be a rush at Pendulum Swing back to services and the money available to be
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:32.180]   spend to spend on products is going to, I think, crash to a certain extent as a correction.
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:41.700]   So I guess we'll watch next year.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.700]   I feel like e-commerce is here to stay though, right?
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.620]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.140]   That's the thing.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:48.620]   Like it's not that e-commerce is going to go away.
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:52.540]   It's at the rapid ascent of e-commerce as a percentage of the larger economy is slower.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:52.900]   Right.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.660]   And so we saw this in Amazon's earnings.
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.180]   AWS crushed it.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:58.940]   The broader e-commerce business of Amazon was kind of soft.
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:03.540]   Shopify had its first kind of quarterly miss, if you will, in its history as a public
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:06.140]   company, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:09.020]   So we're seeing signals that this great
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:12.460]   acceleration of e-commerce or the movement to e-commerce is slowing.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.180]   But Amazon's not going away.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.700]   There's still going to be struggles in the town square.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.420]   But I think that we are seeing a bit of a
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.700]   reversion towards a more normal period of growth, which matters, frankly.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:29.060]   And speaking of the new normal, I mean, I think for a while, for several years,
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:33.860]   Black Friday was a thing, Cyber Monday was a thing because there was a certain
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.620]   volatility to it. There was a lot of competition to drive down prices.
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.220]   There was a lot of loss leading and so on.
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:44.700]   And now I think we've gotten to a new normal where essentially there are discounts
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.820]   all year long.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.500]   And it's really not that big of a deal.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.660]   So it might be spread out, not just that down, just spread out more.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.620]   Exactly.
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:56.780]   It doesn't make sense for a lot of companies to compete for that, you know,
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:00.660]   low price for that one day when they can offer a super low price in the middle
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.900]   of February and like get all the sales for that, you know, for that particular moment.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:08.820]   So I just think I just think it's kind of over now.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.740]   Also, fake shopping holidays are stupid.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.300]   Like why do we have Cyber Monday?
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.380]   One terrible name, two, just awful branding in general.
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:19.540]   Three, it's a Monday.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.300]   I'm busy.
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:20.940]   I'm working.
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.220]   It comes from that fall.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.580]   Let me Brian McCullough.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:24.780]   He's the Internet historian.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.460]   I'm sure can explain this.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:30.140]   It comes from the idea and the word cyber is the dead giveaway.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:36.260]   That back in the day, you would wait to do your online shopping until you got to
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:41.980]   the fast internet at work the day after thing, you know, Monday after Thanksgiving.
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:46.780]   So it was Cyber Monday, but now most people at home have faster than they do at work.
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:50.260]   So nobody's waiting to cyber Monday to buy stuff.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.220]   But I think it's larger point.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.060]   They're spying not only all November, they're buying all year long.
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.940]   I mean, you could surf the Internet
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.380]   or highway in cyber space at work much more precisely.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.300]   Yeah, the Internet superhighways.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.420]   It's a bottom of them.
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.140]   Exactly.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.940]   Another thing to us words now, like if and
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:10.740]   blockchain.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.460]   GM.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:12.660]   G.M.
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.180]   Web three Monday.
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:14.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:14.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.180]   But I mean, another thing to keep in mind is that there are some supply chain issues
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.260]   in these numbers.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:23.180]   So for example, I tried to buy an iPad and I wanted to get an iPad error.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:26.260]   I wanted to get the rose gold one because I bought a pink iMac recently.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.460]   And you kind of match.
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:31.500]   And so I went to the Apple store and they didn't have any iPad errors in
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.260]   Providence and they didn't have any regular iPads either.
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.700]   So I was on the website trying to find one to buy for a long time.
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.020]   And I got buying a refurbished iPad Pro just because it was the only one that
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.540]   would ship to me.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.500]   But I think there's just some stuff that people want that may have a high
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.060]   dollar amount or high ticket price that is just not available.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:49.540]   And that may have also led to some softness in the numbers.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.740]   For sure.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.540]   I mean, you couldn't buy a car.
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:54.820]   You couldn't buy a lot of things.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:00.980]   You know, people buy cars on each e-commerce, but certainly those shortages
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.380]   must have very much had an impact.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:03.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.340]   There's a lot of stuff going on right now that adds to these numbers.
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:10.100]   But I think even given all of these caveats, the fact that we saw some
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:14.300]   declines in volume of sales on these two kind of photo shopping holidays is
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.700]   still a data point worth considering.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:20.300]   It's worth chewing on but not changing your view of the broader market for.
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:25.420]   As as the supply chain crisis itself, there are a whole lot of very complex
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.620]   reasons for it.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:29.540]   And, you know, it's not just one big thing.
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.780]   And speaking of which, Alex, do you have any predictions on when the supply chain
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:37.020]   crisis will ease up, especially around electronics?
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.700]   713 days and two hours.
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.460]   OK, good.
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.940]   I learned something very.
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:42.980]   To be honest, I have no idea.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:47.180]   I learned something very interesting about the supply chain.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:50.140]   I thought it was, you know,
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.780]   I couldn't make enough chips.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.940]   Maybe it's the legacy what they call legacy.
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.260]   No, the older chips.
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:58.660]   But I learned that one of the biggest problems has nothing to do with chips.
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:02.380]   It has to do with substrates.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:07.020]   And there was a substrate fire factory a while ago.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:12.820]   The companies that make these substrates are
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.700]   having a really hard time making enough.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.260]   There's actually a good article in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:22.900]   The chip shortage has made a star of this little known component.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:26.900]   Sourcing a low margin part called the substrate has become a priority for
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:31.820]   Intel NVIDIA named you can't make the chips without the substrate.
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:36.300]   And because of various shortages,
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.020]   we're running out of substrates.
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.180]   So there you go.
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:43.540]   I'll give you that for your tech crunch plus article.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.660]   You can tell the world about substrates.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.420]   Thank you for working in a plug there with the elbow.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:49.620]   I appreciate that.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.020]   I want to throw in to there's other small bottlenecks.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:56.380]   For example, there's a Dutch company that has this specific chip making tool
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.980]   that is very hard to get in there,
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.180]   but essentially a lock on that part of the market and the US wants to prevent
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:02.500]   that tech from reaching China.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.060]   And so there's like, you know, the chip
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.700]   shores can also be kind of focused down to like one Dutch company,
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:11.300]   which is not the way you think about the global, the interconnected economy that we
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.100]   live in.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:15.820]   But there's more weakness than you think because you've stripped all the fact
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:21.420]   out of the supply chain in kind of this this pursuit of marginal profitability
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.540]   at the major corporate level.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:25.260]   And so when something goes wrong, it goes really, really wrong.
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:27.620]   There's no built in cushioners in the system.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.500]   We've just taken all that out just in time stuff.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.340]   So I don't know.
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:37.500]   Leo, do you ever have Chris Mims from the Wall Street Journal?
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.620]   I know him by his byline, but no, we've never had him on.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:43.060]   So he had he has a book.
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.420]   This is a great Christmas present.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:48.260]   Chris is a friend, but he's not paying me to pimp this book,
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:51.700]   but it's called arriving today from factory to the front door.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.380]   It just came out like two months ago or something.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.420]   And it's all about supply chain stuff.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:58.820]   And he started writing it when COVID hit, right?
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.900]   You can't get the book though, because it's a supply chain.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:05.900]   Actually books books have been there's been shortages of books recently anyway.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:11.100]   But so I highly recommend this book because he literally follows a USB
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:17.940]   charger from a factory in Vietnam, you know, shipped across the oceans, then on a truck.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:21.980]   And so he goes into each and every segment of how something gets to your
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:24.500]   door across this global supply chain.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:28.540]   And one of the takeaways and from his subsequent reporting on this stuff, too,
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:32.780]   because as he says, this is accidentally his beat now that now is the collection.
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:38.700]   The pledge is the biggest story in the world is this idea that it's almost an accident
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:44.220]   in the history that since the Berlin Wall fell and globalization happened,
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:50.100]   relatively speaking, the world was a relatively stable place.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:55.060]   And so the supply chain took out all of the slack, as Alex is talking about,
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:20:00.820]   where to get something sitting in a warehouse is costing a corporation money.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.820]   So they only seven days after it's made, they want it in your hands, right?
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:09.660]   And so there's this thinking now that that was again, an accident of history
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:13.700]   that needs to be corrected because maybe going forward for the next few decades
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:18.780]   in theory and hopefully or I don't know, maybe even longer, but that you can't
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:25.420]   rely on the globe being stable enough not to have this level of disruption where a
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:32.780]   hurricane can knock out chip supply or a global pandemic can do things.
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:39.140]   And so a lot of the thinking now is that we need to build capacity back in and
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.820]   take the slackness and put it back in the system.
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:47.300]   This is probably a larger conversation for another day and maybe we can get some
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.700]   people with some expertise in this.
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:53.540]   But I also think it might have been a mistake to rely so heavily on China and
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:21:01.060]   Taiwan for so much of this because it's given China a huge leverage against the world.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:04.700]   And frankly, they have their eyes on Taiwan.
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.420]   They're arming up on Taiwan.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:11.700]   And I wonder, I was talking about this with Lisa the other night, what would we do
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:17.020]   if China decided and we decide we're going to take Taiwan back?
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:20.620]   Would the United States have the willingness to go into a global, what would
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:25.100]   certainly be a world war against superpower over Taiwan?
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:30.460]   And yet without Taiwan and China's manufacturing capacity,
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:34.220]   we lost the war without a shot fired.
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.540]   Well, don't forget how go ahead, Mike first.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:42.140]   Yeah, that's why we need diversification of the supply chain.
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:47.220]   And one of the things, you know, the essential way that complex electronics are
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:51.780]   built is that many of the components are from multiple Asian countries.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:57.540]   They go by ship into China and then they're assembled in final products with
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:01.220]   additional components that are made in China and then shipped out from China.
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:05.780]   And the ports in China have been just overwhelmed,
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.900]   constantly for most of the pandemic.
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:12.300]   A lot of the dock workers were sent home because of
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.460]   quarantines and stuff like that.
[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:16.580]   And by the time they come back, all the ships are like out there waiting.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:20.140]   And so it's it's it's not just the manufacturing part.
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.660]   It's not just the substrates.
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:27.260]   It's dumb stuff like shipping and there's a trend in cybersecurity where
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:32.980]   hackers are targeting ports for ransomware attacks.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:36.820]   And so the port of Los Angeles is completely backed up.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.260]   Lots of the ports where things come and go.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:44.100]   So yeah, what we need is to get everybody thought it was the greatest thing in the
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:46.380]   world to have this just in time stuff, no inventory.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.100]   Everything was shipping in the last minute.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:51.460]   Everybody's patting themselves on the back at how efficient that was.
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.460]   But what we really need is we need to get back to inventory.
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.260]   We need to have lots of diversification.
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:00.420]   A lot of that stuff that's happening in Asia needs to move to Latin America and
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.860]   elsewhere.
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.740]   And I think that process has begun.
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:07.540]   Certainly is funding a lot of that.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:12.260]   TSMC is building a $17 billion fab in Taylor, Texas.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.220]   So that but it takes a long time.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.900]   Takes several years to build those plants.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.940]   Because think about it.
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:26.060]   And I only know this because reading great Bloomberg articles about this, but
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.700]   it's affecting everybody.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:33.220]   China invading Taiwan can't happen yet, even if they wanted to, because if they
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:36.460]   invaded Taiwan and blew up all the factories, they don't have the chip
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.300]   capacity.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.260]   Just as they discovered.
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:44.100]   They discovered that when the Trump administration started to have the trade
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:49.660]   war with them and they lost access to certain chip designs and chip technology.
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:57.300]   They're on this crash course, even in China, to build local chip fabs.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:02.020]   Because if they lost access to Taiwan, they'd be up a creek just like everybody
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.220]   else.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:09.860]   We're all the real message of this is that we are all interdependent.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:14.060]   And we cannot afford to fight each other.
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:15.940]   We've got to work together.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:19.220]   There's a lot of problems that are global that we've got to solve.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:28.140]   And and battling over territory or political mind share is a foolish thing to do at
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:32.620]   this point. We need to solve our problems.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.780]   Somebody's been watching that Beatles documentary.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:41.060]   That is a good way to waste 18 hours of your life.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.140]   No, guys, we can't talk about the Beatles.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:45.700]   I I've already picked a five with the crypto guys.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.140]   I can't also get in trouble with the boomers.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.540]   Oh, no, no, it's I've been watching it.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:55.060]   You have to I mean, you got to bring a lunch because each one of them is three
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.660]   hours and there's three of them.
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.460]   And it's mostly just the Beatles sitting around going on board.
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:00.780]   What do we do now?
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:04.300]   Should we make an album? OK, I'm leaving.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:07.980]   Goodbye. It's just it's really at one point.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:12.100]   Peter Sellers wanders in because he's about to make a movie next door to
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.580]   Kingdom studios and the guys are sitting around.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:15.580]   I don't know what to do.
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.580]   What should we do?
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:18.740]   Sellers sits there for about five minutes ago.
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:19.660]   And this is what he says.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:20.260]   You want to cup of tea?
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:21.620]   Yeah, no, I can't.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:24.540]   I'll be I'm by.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:30.580]   He said with the Beatles, even, you know, at that time in 1968, they were pretty big.
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:31.980]   And he's even he's bored.
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.340]   They were too boring for him.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:34.980]   They were too boring for Peter Sell.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.660]   So but it is fascinating to watch.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:42.380]   And especially when Paul starts noodling at the piano and in effect, rights, let it be
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.780]   in front of you is is amazing.
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:46.060]   So I'm glad that exists.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.220]   Not a Beatles fan, Alex.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:53.820]   Beatles are fine, but I've viewed them as a little bit over indexed upon and I find
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.700]   sort of documentary to be slightly that's why it's great.
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:57.700]   He's a master story.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:58.740]   That's why it's great.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:02.540]   No, no, that's why it's great because we've never it's never before been seen.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.940]   It gives you insight.
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:08.620]   If you are like me, Beatles obsessed and you've read every book and all that because
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:13.020]   things happen there and you're going, that's how that happened.
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.740]   It's fascinating.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:19.660]   But the idea of the documentary about the music creation process is certainly not new.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.100]   I mean, like Metallica got into a large
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:26.300]   bubble with some kind of monster, which was an even deeper dive into the psychology
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.660]   of a band, a kind of the peak issue of their popular.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:29.460]   Oh, I love it.
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:34.660]   When James Hetzfield storms out and slams the door, it's over and goes and goes
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:38.940]   right to rehab, goes straight to rehab, which is fine.
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.700]   No, I mean, all this is fine.
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:43.500]   It's just it's just soft for boomers and that's fine.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:46.220]   I have no beef that I guess I qualify.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:47.100]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.100]   You're I like you.
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:48.860]   You're fine by me.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:54.420]   Yeah, I could it was it's I haven't finished it because it's really long and not a lot
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:56.340]   happens, but it's fascinating when it happens.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:59.780]   It's really like you're watching this and you're going, he's writing, let it be.
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:05.340]   Do you realize that he's and he's his his is like one of the engineers sitting
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:10.460]   next to me, says, well, should it be find myself in times of trouble or maybe find
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.020]   myself in times to double?
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:13.220]   What do you think?
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:18.940]   And Glenn Johnson, a tight trouble and they're writing the song in front of you.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.140]   And it's I don't know.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:20.740]   OK, never mind.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:21.580]   Let's take a break.
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:22.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:23.260]   I'm a boomer.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.340]   What can I say?
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:29.500]   Have we talked about how to do any lunchboxes because I can go on and on about that
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.620]   to our flyer flag, man, yourself.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.460]   Don't listen to me.
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:35.940]   There might be one buried out in the backyard out there.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:36.620]   I don't know.
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.180]   I'll go.
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:37.740]   I'll get a shovel.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.580]   I like to bury stuff out there.
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:45.900]   Alex Wilhelm on the scene of my childhood home reporter at TechCrunch at Alex.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:46.940]   Great to have you.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.460]   Tech.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.020]   Good to be here.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:48.740]   Crunch.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:49.700]   What is it?
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:57.100]   Pro plus plus TechCrunch plus get it for all his incisive writing and the equity
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.300]   podcast, the equity.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.300]   Oh, equity is great.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:27:59.620]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.860]   I'm going to take the extra plug there, Brian.
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.100]   Thank you.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.220]   But I'll go back to you.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.180]   Tech meme right home.
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:04.820]   Fantastic.
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:05.380]   It's nice.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.220]   You guys both listen to each other's podcasts.
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.780]   Yeah, we do really do.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.940]   And they really, and it's sincere.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:14.580]   The tech meme right home, you can find it at TechMaim.com right there on the front
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:18.500]   page, Brian McCullough, the host internet history podcast and others.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:22.020]   And of course, Mike, Mike Elgin at Elgin.com.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:28.180]   And the official photographer of get chatterbox.
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:28.740]   Right?
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.660]   Yes, that's right.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.620]   Chatterbox.com.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:34.500]   Our show today brought to you by
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:38.060]   worldwide technology and Dell technologies.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:44.100]   WWT, if you are a business and you know, you know, technology is the backbone of every
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.700]   business these days, but you need a partner when it comes to enterprise
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:50.100]   technology, I can I make a suggestion?
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:51.660]   Worldwide technology.
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:52.940]   They are amazing.
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:54.340]   They're at the forefront of innovation.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.980]   They work with clients all over the world, transforming their business.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:01.980]   And it all starts with the advanced technology center.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.540]   Fascinating.
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:07.180]   Started with one, you know, one rack in one building and it's spread.
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:12.020]   Many, many hundreds and hundreds of feet of racks in five, I think four or five
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:16.740]   buildings, a research and testing lab that brings together technologies from all
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:21.060]   the leading OEMs, more than half a billion dollars in equipment in this lab.
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:26.980]   This is where WWT's own engineers go to spin up proofs of concept and pilots.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:30.380]   So customers can confidently select the best solutions.
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.420]   They can play with stuff, learn about it.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.060]   But here's the cool thing.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.340]   It's open to you.
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.860]   You can use it too.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:42.140]   Members of the ATC platform can run their own labs there.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:47.700]   I mean, it's this is kind of an amazing gift to the world from worldwide technology.
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.380]   The ATC offers hundreds of on demand and
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:55.100]   schedulable labs, things like Dell's VX Rail or cyber recover solutions.
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:59.060]   You could try the power store, the power flex, the power scale, the power max, all
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:02.900]   the power, unity, data protection, central IDPA.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:07.860]   These labs represent the latest advances in primary storage.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.460]   And you can try it all, but it's not just storage.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:14.580]   Other labs in the ATC represent the newest advances in multi-cloud architecture and
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:19.180]   security in networking and primary and secondary storage and data analytics and AI
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.980]   DevOps and so much more.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:24.900]   With ATC, you could test out products
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:26.700]   as solutions before you go to market.
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:30.460]   You could access technical articles, expert insights, demonstration videos,
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:34.940]   white papers, hands on labs, all the tools you need to stay up to date with the latest
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:37.300]   technology. And here's the best part.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:42.780]   It's free as a member of the WWT platform.
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:44.220]   You can use this.
[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:45.900]   They've virtualized it.
[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:48.380]   You can access these resources anywhere in the world.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:49.060]   You don't have to go to St.
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:52.180]   Louis to do it 365 days a year.
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.980]   And not just the platform, there's also events.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:58.460]   There's communities, all sorts of places you can learn about technology trends.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.820]   Here are the latest research and insights from the experts.
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:01.500]   I love this.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:07.340]   WWT shares their knowledge, shares their resources, and it's all available to you.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:11.860]   If you go to www.t.com/twit, whatever your business need,
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.340]   worldwide technology can deliver scalable,
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:21.780]   try and test tailored solutions because they know that it's not just about the tech.
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:23.740]   It's about execution.
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.060]   It's about strategy.
[01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:29.460]   Tech only works if it supports your business and your business goals.
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:33.100]   They know that better than anybody and they're the partner you want to help make
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.020]   this new world happen.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:39.140]   Learn more about WWT, the ATC to get access to all these free resources.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:45.220]   Again, WWT.com/twit, just create a free account on the platform.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.620]   Amazing.
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:54.460]   Worldwide technology, www.t.com/twit.
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:58.060]   FTC, boy, they have been active.
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:06.980]   Under Lina Khan, going after big tech, now they've sued Nvidia to block acquisition of arm.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:12.060]   This was going to be the biggest semiconductor chip merger in history.
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:18.340]   In fact, because arm stock prices gone up, it was first $32 billion that it was $40
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:19.780]   billion.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:29.340]   As of this week, the cash and stock transaction is now worth $75 billion.
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:33.180]   And the FTC is about to scuttle the deal entirely.
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:37.340]   Alex Wilhelm, is it over for Nvidia and arm?
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:38.980]   It certainly seems so.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:42.540]   I mean, we've seen a much more active American government on the antitrust beat.
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:45.260]   Just think back to what happened with Visa and Plot.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:48.540]   That was a smaller deal, to be clear, and a different kind of industry.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:50.940]   I think this is the new normal now.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.340]   What's their objection to this?
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:55.300]   Because that seems to me that this would be a good thing.
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.180]   Why?
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.780]   Does it make Nvidia too powerful?
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.900]   I'll tell you why.
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.900]   We've got really Intel.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:02.660]   We've got AMD.
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.340]   That's the x86 guys.
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:06.980]   Under arm, we've got Qualcomm.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:10.300]   We've got Samsung, MediaTek, a few small companies.
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:12.420]   We've got Apple, of course, making arm.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:16.860]   What would be wrong with making Nvidia a big player in that space as well?
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.100]   More than the merrier, the better the competition.
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:23.260]   We clearly, that's one's answer to supply shortage, right?
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:26.660]   Well, why doesn't Nvidia just get into the arm business itself, as opposed to?
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:27.780]   Well, they are buying.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.660]   They make Tigris.
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:30.100]   They make arm processors.
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:33.580]   They buy, they have an arm, I'm sure that it's an architecture license.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:34.940]   They have an arm license.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.900]   Arm doesn't make anything.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:37.780]   Right.
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:40.980]   They're a fabulous design firm.
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:43.140]   Do you want to have the fabulous design firm?
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.500]   Then in that case, under the auspices of one particular company,
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.500]   do you think they should stay independent?
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.940]   To me, the anti-dependent of angle here isn't too hard to see.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:55.180]   Versus, I'm struggling to really figure out who's going to benefit from the
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:57.540]   takeover aside from Nvidia.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:00.940]   Well, maybe not at that price because I have to say 75 billion.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:05.460]   It's starting to look like maybe Nvidia might breathe a sigh of relief here.
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:10.900]   But that's also, that's the problem for arm and soft bank that owns them is that.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:14.780]   So if this deal goes down and soft bank is like,
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:17.260]   fine, we'll just do an IPO.
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:21.340]   There's no way that IPO is going to be 75 million dollars.
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:21.780]   No.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:22.260]   So.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:23.260]   But so.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.460]   And I don't think soft bank is a better
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.500]   owner to answer your question, Alex,
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.020]   then Nvidia would be.
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:31.420]   I think they're probably a worse owner.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.500]   Go ahead, Brian.
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.100]   Are they?
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.820]   But my question maybe to Alex is,
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:40.420]   are they essentially unacquireable because is there a buyer
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:43.580]   for whom a strong argument?
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:47.460]   Anyone that could buy them, you could make the argument that,
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:51.220]   well, we can't let them buy them because then it's too strategic for everybody.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.820]   But they just cut everybody else off.
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:53.620]   That's a good point.
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:56.500]   It's not only applies in video that.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.020]   Sorry, everybody's lost now.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:58.500]   Nobody.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:00.020]   That only applies to US companies.
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.740]   So the FCC has no, you know,
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:05.740]   but the EU also investigated UK,
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:10.420]   which is where arm is headquartered, said, we don't like this idea either.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:12.380]   I mean, I think there's a global.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:12.900]   Yes.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.300]   And if no, this isn't going to happen.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.500]   China was also looking into the deal of.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:21.260]   I'm sure I'm sure the Chinese companies
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:25.340]   probably love to buy arm and then cut us all off of it.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:28.540]   To me, the more important thing is not this particular deal,
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:32.580]   but just the change in how technology transactions are being viewed by major
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:34.500]   governments around the world or governing blocks.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:39.220]   And we just saw this recently with Facebook, sorry, meta and Giffy.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:40.420]   I think that was in the UK.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:40.900]   Yes.
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:41.700]   The UK.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:46.420]   I'm curious, can they force meta to sell Giffy?
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.020]   That's what they say.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:53.660]   I don't know how much market leverage the UK has outside of the European Union body,
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.740]   but we do know that the EU can throw its weight around.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:58.140]   So, well, the EU would probably be successful,
[01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:01.340]   but what would would meta have to withdraw from the United Kingdom and say,
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:04.260]   OK, I guess we will ignore them and not do business there.
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:05.860]   Alex, I don't know if you've heard this,
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:09.340]   but I've heard they're considering that that they're considering just, you know,
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:12.860]   being like, all right, we'll either take the fine that you would levy against us
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:19.140]   or rewrite it just for the UK market because it might be it might be worth it
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:23.100]   to take any slap on the risk to to do this everywhere else in the world.
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:26.420]   Well, this is why I've been a big advocate for larger technology finds.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:29.140]   But I find really funny is when like the FCC or the SEC is like,
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.980]   we find Facebook a million dollars.
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:31.540]   Yeah, big.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:35.300]   And I'm like, stupid is you just literally told them the price for doing this thing
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:36.100]   is a million dollars.
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:39.500]   They're going to do it a hundred thousand times because they don't care.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:44.460]   That was one of the strengths of GDPR is the fines were a percentage of your
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:50.060]   income of your revenue and I mean, significant fines, billions.
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.700]   On the point there about the actual Nvidia deal, keep in mind,
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:56.660]   I just pulled this up to refresh my memory, but there were a huge chunk of shares
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:00.380]   involved. I think it was that's why it's seventy four point three million.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:00.780]   Right.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:05.380]   So what we're seeing is the appreciation of Nvidia right in the Bitcoin blockchain
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:06.980]   GPU era, if you will.
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:10.620]   So they've essentially priced deal in their own their own currency, which went up in
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:10.980]   value.
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:15.700]   So you got screwed yourself to a degree, I think.
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:22.380]   I don't know what you know, on the one hand, I'm glad that governments are
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:26.620]   sitting up and developing a spine and saying, you know, this isn't a good thing.
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:28.620]   This is this kind of aggregation of tech.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:32.100]   But on the other hand, I'm kind of terrified of the notion that governments
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:36.060]   are going to have such a huge influence on how tech companies get run.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.260]   I don't know, which is worse.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:38.380]   I really don't know.
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:40.180]   I don't think I don't think that's entirely fair.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:43.460]   And to bring up a point, why think about what Christopher
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:49.220]   Mendez wrote again for the journal about neo conglomerates recently and how we
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:52.500]   used to kind of look up to GE that did, you know, everything from like airplane
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:56.220]   engines to like appliances and now we're seeing major tech companies in that way.
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.540]   I don't see the government telling tech companies what they can and can't do.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.980]   You're not going to break up Amazon.
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:01.700]   Good luck.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:07.300]   But not letting Amazon buy more smaller companies to increase its own in market
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.700]   half seems very reasonable to me.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:11.260]   We're not saying that Facebook can't make its own gift product.
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:13.260]   We're saying that they can't buy Giffy, which is different.
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.900]   I loved this piece, by the way, from your your your pal Chris.
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:22.500]   Move over GE, the tech conglomerates of the new leaders of industry.
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:29.260]   And his proposition is that Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta are the big
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:32.020]   farmers as GE and others fade away.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:35.980]   The dismantling of general electric to she, but Johnson and Johnson, Siemens
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:39.420]   Dow DuPont, United Technologies.
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:40.380]   That makes sense.
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.380]   The industrial era is over.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.820]   It's the information era. Yeah.
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:48.820]   I actually I have a small I'm going to tell you nice about myself.
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:51.060]   I wrote a piece about this in like 2014.
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:53.900]   I'm like these platform companies are just getting to be super huge.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.060]   They're doing everything now.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:58.580]   And it's one of the very few things I've noticed slightly early that ended up
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:00.380]   correct, usually I'm wrong.
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:03.100]   So I just want to get myself one point for actually getting to be right.
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:04.180]   Just you know what?
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:06.140]   You're so self deprecating.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:11.340]   Alex, just a little advice say, you know, I knew that back in 2014,
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:15.020]   see my article Christopher Mims, you're late to the game.
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:17.420]   Yeah, but Leo chest thumping here.
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:18.380]   It's OK.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:22.180]   Yeah, 2014, you would have said that, but post rehab need as a much smaller ego.
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:24.060]   It's a different it's a different Alex.
[01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:26.580]   It's an important one. I hope.
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:29.020]   Yes, you were always great.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:31.980]   You were always always enjoyed you, Alex.
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:35.020]   Always means them's lump together.
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:39.220]   Companies like Amazon and Apple, which aren't really lumpable.
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:40.340]   They're different businesses.
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:45.900]   Yeah, because because Amazon does a vastly larger number of things that are
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:48.620]   completely his point is Apple wants to, right?
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:49.700]   They want to get into cars.
[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:50.820]   They want to do other things too.
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:54.540]   So but my argument, which again, I'll thump my chest.
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:55.860]   I wrote this long before Christopher
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.100]   wrote it even before Alex Wilhelm.
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:02.540]   Yes, it vlog before Alex will have ever wrote anything like this.
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:04.500]   He a
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:08.020]   before he was a twinkle in the eye.
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:08.740]   Go ahead.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:12.220]   I know that car is not a car.
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:15.140]   A self driving car is a supercomputer and a robot.
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:19.100]   Yeah. And actually, that's what Tim Cook, I think, said, is it's a robot.
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:20.100]   We're building robots.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:23.420]   Apple is in the artificial intelligence business.
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:26.020]   And in the consumer electronics business, it's going to be a content
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:30.460]   consumption device as much as it is at conveyance.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:38.300]   And so if Apple did ordinary gas, gas and cars with no sophisticated computers,
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:39.820]   yes, that would be a different business.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:43.180]   But the future of self driving cars, the car that Apple's actually working on,
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:47.620]   is a lot more like a, you know, a lot more like an iPhone
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:52.020]   than than than a car is true.
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:55.860]   Cook, we were talking about this on Macbreak Weekly on Tuesday.
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.900]   Cook doesn't see himself as getting into the car business.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.740]   He says himself is getting into the autonomous robot business.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:05.060]   That autonomy is what they're interested in.
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:07.900]   Yes. Cars is just one manifestation of that.
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:11.580]   That's kind of that's kind of that's a much bigger ambition.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:14.140]   So, you know, I think, well,
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:18.820]   currently Apple is not in Amazon territory, but they'd like to be.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.580]   They'd like to diversify.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:25.020]   I think the biggest, the biggest area that they're getting into that is
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:26.900]   unrelated to the business is finance.
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:29.620]   So the whole platinum card and all that stuff,
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:34.820]   I think that there's a huge future for Apple in doing banking, essentially.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:40.340]   Alex Lindsey keeps wondering why they haven't turned Apple card and Apple pay into a bank.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:46.060]   Alex is all I know from banks that I learned in the TV show Billions.
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:49.460]   Well, I'm sure that's representative.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:50.540]   But I think Mr.
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:54.260]   Algon is dead on that there is a large future for them there because people have
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:58.060]   a willingness to give Apple control over parts of their finance.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.020]   We trust in the TV show.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:06.060]   So much more lives billions owning a bank was a completely different kind of business
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:09.100]   because of regulators like Paul.
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:10.860]   Do you money like Paul Jamari?
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:12.140]   Yeah, he's tough.
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:16.740]   And then there's that then there's the I don't know.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:17.860]   It's a complicated story.
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:22.060]   Wags wags wags as kids go to my kids school.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:22.660]   No kidding.
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.060]   That's why I see him.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:25.060]   I love him.
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:25.980]   He's a great actor.
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:26.660]   Ask him.
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:27.460]   David Costable.
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:34.260]   If asked David if he read the article that said he is the Tinkerbell to Axelrod's
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:36.260]   Peter Pan.
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:37.260]   I'm curious.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.660]   He has a goal alert on his.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.060]   Yeah, it probably does.
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:40.660]   Probably does.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:45.260]   Is this how most people feel when people bring up like NFTs because I have no idea
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:47.460]   that we're doing this to you on purpose?
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:50.060]   Yes, we're doing this to you on purpose.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:52.060]   Well, you don't have a Showtime subscription.
[01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.460]   Come on.
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:56.460]   I refuse to watch capitalism.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:58.660]   You have enough of it during the day.
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:02.260]   Yeah, I don't need to watch succession to realize that.
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:03.060]   I love success.
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:05.060]   I love success.
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:05.660]   You know why?
[01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:08.860]   Because these guys are so they're wealthy to the Murdoch land basically.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:13.860]   They're multi multi multi billionaires and their lives are so dreary and horrible
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:15.060]   and miserable.
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:17.460]   And I just love that about it.
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:20.860]   Make sure you can buy your own island, but you're miserable on it.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:23.260]   That's what I that's what I like to hear.
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.260]   So I watched the first episode and gave up.
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:27.860]   So I'll show it to you from it gets better.
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:28.860]   It gets even better.
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:30.460]   So Giffy.
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:32.260]   So what is Facebook going to do?
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:34.460]   Are they going to divest?
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:37.060]   Oh, my gosh, I mean, I don't know.
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:39.660]   I don't think anyone knows quite yet, but I think it will be a lost or dead,
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:43.460]   which you're really asking their Leo is when you get hit with something like this,
[01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:45.260]   what is the big tech response?
[01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:46.860]   And I don't think we really have a play.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.460]   It's just the beginning, isn't it?
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:50.460]   Yeah, just disable.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:55.060]   I mean, this is just for this particular instance, can they just disable it in the UK?
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:56.060]   And would that be enough?
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.060]   That's what I've heard.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:01.660]   That's what I've heard is that you can disable Giffy big deal, but would the UK then take
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.660]   arms against meta?
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:08.460]   Well, right, because like the the nuclear option would be, oh, what are they going to block
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:11.060]   Facebook on ISPs across the land?
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:12.260]   Like they would never go that far.
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:12.860]   Sure.
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:14.660]   Mark Zuckerberg would love it.
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:15.900]   That would be the best thing.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:18.980]   It's just like when Google said to Spain, well, you don't want Google News.
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:22.460]   You don't get Google News and Spain capitulated.
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:26.660]   I think go ahead, UK government challenge.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:30.860]   I think about see how your see how your voters feel about that.
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:34.940]   Between Zuckerberg and Boris Johnson, who would you rather have won a cage match?
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:38.580]   I would like to see the both in the cage match.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:40.460]   Yeah, to be clear, though, but who would you root for?
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:44.660]   It's kind of like I don't know mutual assured destruction, I guess.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.860]   Speaking of which the Russians, this is crazy.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:54.060]   When is when have ever people put the word crazy in Russians together?
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:59.860]   So yeah, first time ever, the Russians are threatening criminal charges against a
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.460]   NASA astronaut.
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:07.660]   They say drilled a hole intentionally in the International Space Station because
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:09.860]   they were homesick.
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:15.060]   Ross Cosmos, the Russian Space Corporation has completed an investigation into the
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:20.860]   whole fan in a Soyuz spacecraft while docked to the ISS in 2018.
[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:29.860]   They've all along said we think it was astronaut Serena Onyun Chancellor who
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.660]   wanted to go home.
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:36.060]   So intentionally drilled a hole in their spacecraft.
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:41.060]   The NASA says we have cameras on all the astronauts during the time this must have
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:42.460]   happened when the leak was detected.
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:45.060]   They were nowhere near this.
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:50.460]   NASA thinks it was the Russians building the Soyuz that made a mistake.
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:55.660]   They screwed up and they're covered up and they're covering it up.
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:57.660]   Crazy man.
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:00.860]   The best part of the story though in the actual artist technical piece, there's a
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:02.660]   section called Russian Prodications.
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:06.060]   And the first sentence reads the reality is that these the Russian
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.660]   attacks are indeed false.
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.460]   Just I love the declare.
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:10.260]   I declare it.
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:11.460]   That is all the way.
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:12.060]   It's BS.
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:12.660]   Yeah.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:18.060]   Well, and then the Chinese or I'm sorry the Russian military that shot its own
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:23.460]   satellite testing their anti-satellite ballistic missiles creating debris which
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:28.060]   forced the astronauts to shelter for two hours because they were afraid the
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.460]   debris would hit the ISS.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:33.860]   Oh, this is like having a crazy neighbor.
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:35.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:40.060]   You know, who blames you because their bears have gotten loose.
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:44.260]   Yeah, or more like a crazy flat made who like takes your mixer and crashes it
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:45.660]   on the floor and is like, you broke it.
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:46.460]   You broke it.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:47.460]   You broke it.
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:48.460]   What's wrong with you?
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:53.660]   Do you want to hear sounds the sounds of Mars?
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:54.260]   Would you like to?
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:54.860]   Yes.
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:47:00.660]   The sounds, ladies and gentlemen, the Mars Rover sounds from Mars.
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:01.660]   That's it.
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:02.860]   That's it.
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:04.060]   There's no difference.
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:05.260]   It's just going to sound like that.
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:06.260]   There's no many.
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:07.460]   Hello.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.260]   Hello.
[01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:10.860]   But they put, they did to their credit.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:15.060]   They put good quality microphones on the perseverance.
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:20.660]   And now we hear actually, I think you're hearing the giant correct me.
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:22.260]   Is the wheels moving?
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:23.660]   There's something you're hearing.
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:24.660]   Yeah.
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:26.660]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:29.860]   There's something you're hearing.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:35.860]   Sounds of space.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:36.660]   OK.
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:37.660]   Is that a typewriter?
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:39.660]   I don't know what this is.
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:43.060]   Just what I just know you should never write on the CMS.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:43.660]   I just know that.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:44.460]   That's all I know.
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:45.260]   Oh my gosh.
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:46.860]   I can't believe we've asked that.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.660]   We talked about that off air.
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:49.860]   Hours ago.
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.660]   OK.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:57.260]   Do you remember that time on the Internet when everyone would take little
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.660]   steps and like auto tune them and turn them into songs?
[01:47:59.660 --> 01:47:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:00.460]   It was that.
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:01.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:05.260]   We need to take the sounds of Mars and do like the dubstep remix of what
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:06.860]   Mars sounds like because that would actually be fun.
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:13.580]   I think that they stopped doing the auto tune songs after a song
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:18.780]   if I did the definitive auto tune with Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:20.060]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:21.460]   Everyone.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:25.260]   We are live from my backyard where I am.
[01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:28.060]   Smokey means me like a brisket.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:29.660]   I'm making me now.
[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:31.860]   Someone asked me to I spoke me.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:33.460]   It's going to be delicious.
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:34.260]   I spoke me.
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.660]   That's all I'm talking about.
[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:36.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:37.660]   Give me a sock.
[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:38.660]   Give me a sock.
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:39.860]   Fuse.
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:41.060]   The stock.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:41.860]   My name.
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:43.060]   Maybe give me a sock.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.060]   Give me a sock.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:44.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:46.860]   I can't stop playing this.
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:48.460]   I'll talk to you.
[01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:52.060]   Thanks for hanging out with me in my backyard while I'm smoking these
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:55.260]   needs to the thing about smoking me is it takes a long.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:57.460]   Time sitting around with my Wi-Fi.
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.660]   I like racing.
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:48:59.460]   Grilling me.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:04.100]   Racing cars are two of the most fun things that you do that you'll
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:04.860]   transmission.
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:06.260]   I enjoy that.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:06.860]   Do I.
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:08.660]   Smokey.
[01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:09.060]   Beep.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:09.860]   Smokey.
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:10.060]   Beep.
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:10.660]   Smokey.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:11.060]   Smokey.
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:11.660]   Smokey.
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:12.060]   Now.
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:12.860]   Zuck.
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:14.260]   Oh no.
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:16.260]   It seems I was daydreaming again.
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:19.260]   That's why I made clear that you have had subpoenas.
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.860]   Is that correct?
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:23.300]   Mr.
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:28.860]   Zuckerberg, what is Facebook doing to prevent foreign actors from interfering
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.260]   in US elections?
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:31.260]   We are smoking.
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:31.860]   Beep.
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:32.460]   Beep.
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:33.660]   Like a brisket.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:35.260]   I'm making me now.
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:35.660]   OK.
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:37.460]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:38.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:41.460]   I'm just going to watch this for the next hour and we'll be back with more this
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.260]   weekend tech.
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:44.660]   It's just a little bit.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.260]   We had a great week on Twitch.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:52.660]   Let's watch this movie and enjoy Jeremy says have you experienced a
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:55.460]   battle from the cameras on the Pixel 6 Pro?
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:56.660]   I definitely have a rattle.
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:58.660]   I don't have a rattle that way.
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:49:59.060]   OK.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:00.660]   I have a rattle if I do it this way.
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:01.060]   All right.
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:02.660]   It's very scientific experiment.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:04.060]   Stay frontal and phone.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:06.260]   It's a treat on Twitch.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:07.460]   Tech News weekly.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:11.860]   Jack Dorsey leaving Twitter for Square and Square becoming block.
[01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:13.660]   It's a tangled mess.
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:15.060]   Especially over the last few months.
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:19.460]   He's really become more focused on Bitcoin and crypto in general.
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:23.060]   They've announced that they are going to come up with their own consumer
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:25.460]   hardware wallet hands on photography.
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:29.060]   We're going to talk about moon photography and how you can capture moon
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.660]   photography with whatever camera you're using.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.060]   Yes, I said whatever camera you're using.
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:36.260]   Windows weekly.
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:39.260]   Microsoft keeps messing with edge.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:43.060]   There's some indication that this by now pay later may in fact literally be
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:46.260]   malicious and have serious problems.
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:47.660]   It's not a Microsoft service.
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:48.860]   It's a third party service.
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:49.460]   Wait a minute.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:50.860]   It's not even Microsoft service.
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:52.660]   They just said to some third party.
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:53.260]   Go ahead.
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:55.060]   Put your crap in our browser.
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:55.460]   What?
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:56.660]   So here to it.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:57.860]   Tell your boss.
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:59.260]   It's job related.
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:03.660]   Now I have to shut it off because there's so many intrusive things like rewards
[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:04.260]   are coming up.
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:07.860]   I got one that said you can put out coupons on paper from this site.
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:08.860]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:09.660]   That one.
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:10.260]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:11.260]   Yeah.
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:17.460]   By the way, I got a rattle to Jason on my Pixel 6.
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:19.660]   That's just the optical image stabilization.
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:20.860]   Don't worry about it.
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:23.060]   He's going to blame me because Mike, you know this.
[01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:24.660]   I borrowed his Pixel 6.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:25.860]   It took it to Mexico.
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:28.860]   So I had pictures from Oaxaca, which came out great by the way.
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:31.860]   And this is mine.
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:32.660]   It has the same thing.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:35.660]   So don't blame me, Jason, for your jiggles.
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:40.060]   Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:44.460]   I love these guys using the internet without Express VPN
[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:49.460]   is like leaving your laptop exposed at the coffee shop while you run to the bathroom.
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:55.460]   A good VPN protects you, protects your privacy and also gives you the chance to,
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:57.660]   you know, watch Netflix in another country.
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:02.460]   There's three very valuable things a VPN could do, but there's something you should be aware of.
[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:05.460]   If you're trying to protect your privacy and security,
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:09.460]   you rely on the VPN provider to be secure and private.
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:12.660]   That's why I recommend and only use Express VPN.
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:20.260]   Express VPN is regularly audited to make sure that they protect your privacy
[01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:21.660]   and they protect your security.
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:22.460]   How do they do that?
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:23.860]   Well, in a couple of ways.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:25.860]   First of all, they destroy all logs.
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:27.260]   They keep no track of your visit.
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:31.660]   That's really important because they cannot be subpoenaed for what you were doing online.
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:34.460]   They can't sell your information on to marketers.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.860]   They care so much about this.
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:38.860]   They actually wrote the trusted server technology they use,
[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:41.660]   which when you join an Express VPN server,
[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:44.860]   easy to do, press that big button on the app.
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:48.660]   They spin up into RAM only the trusted server.
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:50.660]   It runs in RAM sandbox.
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.060]   It cannot cannot write to the hard drive.
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.660]   So it can't log what you're doing.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:59.460]   And then immediately after you close out the session, it disappears out of RAM.
[01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:03.260]   There is literally zero trace of you being there.
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:05.260]   That's what you want.
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:08.660]   It also protects you if you're in a coffee shop from being hacked.
[01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:11.260]   You can go out now and buy a Wi-Fi pineapple.
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:16.460]   Makes it easy to attack people's computers if they're sitting there on an open Wi-Fi access bar point.
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:19.260]   But if they if you're using Express VPN, they can't see you're there.
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:22.860]   All they see is gobbledygook encryption.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:24.260]   That's it.
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:27.060]   So it's an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet.
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:28.260]   They can't steal your data.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:29.860]   They can't get into your system.
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:32.260]   And then of course, there's the great geographic benefits.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:33.660]   I love Express VPN.
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:34.460]   You can trust them.
[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:39.460]   They spend money to make sure that their infrastructure is fast enough to watch HD video.
[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:43.780]   In fact, one of the problems with some older VPNs was it was so slow.
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:45.460]   I didn't want to use it with Express VPN.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:46.660]   I leave it on all the time.
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:47.860]   You can run it on your phone.
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:52.460]   You can run it on your computer, but you can even put it on a router so that your entire home is protected.
[01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:55.260]   And I guarantee you nobody's going to say, what happened to the internet?
[01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:56.660]   It's going to be just as fast.
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:59.660]   You won't even know, but you'll be twice as safe.
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:06.260]   It would take a hacker with a supercomputer a billion years to get past Express VPNs encryption.
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.260]   It works everywhere you go.
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:11.060]   It is the best VPN in the world.
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:15.660]   And right now we got a deal for you three extra months free when you sign up for a year
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:17.660]   that brings it down below seven bucks a month.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.860]   I know you can get free VPNs.
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:21.460]   How do they pay for themselves?
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:22.660]   You might ask that question.
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:23.460]   It's worth it.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:30.660]   Secure your online data today by visiting ExpressVPN.com slash to it less than seven bucks a month for absolute protection.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:33.460]   Express VPN.com slash to it.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:38.260]   Express.
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:49.460]   Three months extra free with one year subscription protector online privacy with Express VPN.
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.460]   I don't know even know what this means.
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:58.860]   The headline is meta has chosen AWS as its long term strategic cloud provider.
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:03.260]   I was baffled by this doesn't didn't Facebook a.k.a.
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:09.860]   Meta the company formerly known as Facebook spent all this money open compute and network centers.
[01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:12.460]   And what do they need Amazon for Alex?
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.860]   Do you know?
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:19.860]   I mean, I have a hunch, which is that Facebook is the service used around the world by lots of people all the time.
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:26.660]   And Facebook is not going to put quite as much capital as Amazon is into AWS or Microsoft and Azure.
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:31.660]   So they probably want to have someone to cover in some blanks office for global use then.
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.060]   That's my that's my read.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:36.060]   I love to get Brian and Mike to back me up and tell me if I'm wrong or right.
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:37.860]   But that was my hunch when I when I saw this.
[01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:40.460]   Yeah, that was weird.
[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:43.660]   You agree guys?
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:56.660]   Well, yeah, I think I think that I think they're they're reengineering or claiming to reengineering the entire company around around the metaverse making social, you know, creating an alternative digital.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.260]   Reality that we all live in.
[01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:06.060]   And I think that they would like to focus on that and not focus on running gigantic data centers in the Arctic Circle and all that kind of stuff.
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:08.060]   So, you know, I think it's just a focus thing.
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:18.660]   I think they if you can imagine what they're already up against with the videos and photos that are uploaded and downloaded from Facebook every day with the number of users they have.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.860]   It's just a catastrophically huge mine data.
[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:23.860]   Absolutely.
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:28.260]   And now they're talking about, oh, let's increase that by a hundredfold.
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:36.060]   You know, it's probably, you know, AWS is probably one of the few companies that can handle that sort of ramp up that they're talking about.
[01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:38.860]   And they still have to deal with the photos and the videos, right?
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:41.060]   So it's all additional.
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:48.260]   Sorry, I was on mute, but my only take would be, I mean, for things like this.
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:51.060]   Does it hurt to have your eggs in several different baskets?
[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:52.060]   You know, right.
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:56.260]   Like, I know, I know if you're Microsoft, you want to do all of your stuff in house.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:57:01.660]   But if that's not your main core business, then I'd have a little, sure I'd have a little AWS.
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:03.060]   I'd have a little here, a little there.
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:03.660]   All right.
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:04.660]   Seems smart.
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:05.460]   All right.
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.660]   I won't worry about that too much.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:09.860]   I wonder one last thing on this point.
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:21.860]   I wonder if there are recent blackout, which was really embarrassing for Facebook where multiple of their products went down.
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:25.060]   Facebook is incredibly PR driven.
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:35.060]   And that just made them look like a bunch of clowns that, you know, these stories about how they couldn't even get into their own, you know, server cage to fix it and all that kind of stuff.
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:42.060]   Most of those stories were not true, but basically they had a big crash and everybody was kind of pointing and laughing at Facebook on Twitter.
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:48.660]   And so part of this might be just somebody else to blame if things go south.
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:52.860]   Because it's not like that hasn't happened to AWS, by the way, and Microsoft.
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:56.860]   But again, if it's going to happen, it's better for Facebook to say those guys.
[01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:58.460]   It's over there.
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:57:59.860]   Pay no attention.
[01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:05.260]   We were talking or you saw in the promo about what Microsoft is doing with Edge, which is just reprehensible.
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:07.860]   They added a buy now pay later feature.
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:08.860]   It's not an extension.
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:10.060]   You can't turn it off.
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:12.460]   They have a coupon search built into Edge.
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:14.660]   But there is some good news.
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:17.860]   This broke a couple of days ago, Tom Warren writing in the Verge.
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:22.060]   But I think actually it was Raphael Rivera who found it.
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:33.460]   For a while, the reason people were upset about Edge is being bloated was that Microsoft was making it really hard on Windows 11 to change the default browser.
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:37.260]   You couldn't just push one button and use Firefox or Chrome.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:45.460]   You'd have to go through every single app extension, every single document extension that a browser could open and say, yeah, I want that to be opened by Chrome.
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:46.260]   Yeah, that too.
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:52.260]   And it was a very long, multi-click process that was just from a normal person, probably undoable.
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:54.460]   Firefox figured out a way around it.
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.060]   Microsoft reversed that.
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:58.060]   They blocked Firefox from doing that.
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:01.660]   So we really thought they were going to make people use Edge as the default browser.
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:06.460]   Well, at least for now, they've backtracked on those browser changes.
[01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:15.660]   They're going to let you with one button as it used to be change all of the things.
[01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:24.860]   So this is the dialogue you'd get where you'd have to go through every extension, HTML, PDF, HTML, SVG.
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:26.860]   Now you just click this one button.
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:28.460]   I hope that stays.
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:30.860]   They probably got a little bit of heat from.
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:41.260]   Isn't it funny that everybody's remembering the hits with Microsoft all the sudden because Europe is thinking of suing them for bundling teams.
[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:47.460]   So you've got bundling, you've got Microsoft playing fast and loose with browser bundling and things like that.
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:52.260]   It's like everyone's like waking up and being like, oh, yeah, if we're going to do antitrust stuff,
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:55.860]   Microsoft has gotten a free pass these last few years, but they're the OGs.
[01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:59:57.060 --> 02:00:00.260]   Also, you can just hear echoes of the pre-sauce,
[02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:04.660]   Angela, Microsoft in these issues like who thought this was a good idea?
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:06.860]   Who signed off on this system?
[02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:09.060]   Who thought, oh, yes, we're not going to get a hit for this.
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:10.460]   We're not going to have to backtrack on this.
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:12.660]   This is not going to create problems for us.
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:21.660]   Let's make everyone use Edge and then let's bake in some crap to try to what really drives some tiny incremental revenue compared to their aggregate.
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:23.060]   Like that's the question.
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:24.560]   Why would who cares?
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:27.860]   Why would you even do that Microsoft for you that desperate for?
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:28.660]   No, they're not.
[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:29.060]   Yeah.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:35.560]   But I guarantee you there was there was some corporate planning OK are about how edge you drive X revenue by day.
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:35.960]   Why?
[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:38.160]   And people wanted to get their bonuses so they followed it.
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:45.560]   And I was just it's amazing that I got out and made it into the public and that they made the double down mistake on Firefox and had to end up here.
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.260]   It was always going to end up here.
[02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:51.260]   And by the way, if you want to poison user trust, do stuff like this.
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:53.660]   For example, on iOS, it happened to be today.
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:59.160]   If someone texts you an address and you click on it, it wants to load Apple Maps.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.960]   Well, I deleted that and I run Google Maps like everyone else.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:05.760]   But iOS, when you click on an address that says, oh, you don't have Apple Maps.
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:06.860]   Do you want to download it?
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:09.660]   I'm like, no, I want to send me to my mapping application.
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:14.760]   I know you can do that Apple because you're not made up of morons.
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:19.260]   You're just trying to get me to use your crappy product and it makes me really hate iOS.
[02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.060]   So like, don't do this Microsoft.
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:22.060]   What the hell?
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:22.860]   Yeah.
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:25.560]   Yeah.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:26.860]   Right.
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:27.660]   I agree.
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:28.260]   Yeah.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:31.660]   Frank Frank Shaw is going to see a tweet, but I'm still right about this.
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:36.860]   Well, next week, we're going to have the chief marketing officer, Chris Capicella on Windows Weekly.
[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:37.660]   That should be fun.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.860]   I'm surprised he wants to be on, but OK, Chris, Chris, Chris.
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:42.860]   I know I'm on Chris.
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:43.260]   Great.
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:44.060]   Love Chris.
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:47.060]   He's always straight forward and honest.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:51.660]   You know, and this is the thing you learn is that these companies are filled with great people,
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:55.660]   but they don't necessarily control every aspect of the company's operation.
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:02:00.660]   You know, and somebody in marketing at Microsoft said, you know, we really need to buy now,
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:03.660]   pay later, plug in for edge and forced it through.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:04.660]   Yeah.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:05.660]   But here's the thing.
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:06.660]   Ryan's right.
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:10.860]   There is a different climate of antitrust and making mistakes of this sort.
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:17.860]   Now, it's the worst possible time to appear to be a platform player over leveraging your built in advantages.
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:18.860]   Just stupid.
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:19.660]   Don't do it.
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:20.260]   Don't do it.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:27.260]   Especially if you've been skating so much lately, everybody forgot to invite them to all the congressional hearings about that.
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:28.060]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:33.260]   But this was a good time for Microsoft just to keep its head down and pay no attention.
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:34.860]   And keep mentioning that's why they did it.
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:35.860]   They're going left out.
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:36.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:37.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:40.260]   We really want to go to go to go to Washington.
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:42.660]   Such it was lonely lonely.
[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:47.060]   A new rule will allow debt collectors to track you down on social media.
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:49.260]   You can't DM you, but they can't.
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:53.060]   I guess they can't tweet you in public, but they can DM you.
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:54.060]   Yes.
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:58.860]   Email text messages, social media all open.
[02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:03.260]   These are changes to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:08.660]   They were introduced under the Trump regime and now are law.
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:14.860]   So get ready for your creditors to slide into your DMs.
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:19.660]   Maybe we'll just say we should be upset about.
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:23.460]   I mean, I don't, you know, they can do it, but you can block them.
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:23.860]   Right.
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:26.060]   I feel like it's fine.
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:27.260]   I mean, yeah, exactly.
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.460]   What do you call you?
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:30.060]   They can send you a letter in the mail.
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:33.660]   Why not? Why not? You're publicly known Twitter account.
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.260]   Yeah.
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:35.460]   Yeah.
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:40.460]   Just making sure we've covered all of our bases.
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:44.660]   I did want to mention the passing of Jim Warren.
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:46.060]   I don't know if any of you knew.
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:48.260]   Might you remember Jim?
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:50.460]   No.
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:55.060]   He was the guy who created the West Coast Computer Fair.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.060]   Uh huh.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:04:00.660]   In fact, you might remember the famous images of him roller skating around.
[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:02.660]   This was back in the 70s.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:05.060]   This was where the Apple II was introduced.
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:12.060]   In fact, here's a picture of Steve Jobs at the Apple booth at the first West Coast Computer Fair.
[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:17.060]   It was really a big part of early days in Silicon Valley.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:21.860]   Jim Warren was a great guy, passed away at the age of 85 this week.
[02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:27.860]   I just wanted to mention that a very important person in the early days of personal computing.
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:33.660]   And now I think we can let you all enjoy your Sunday evening.
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:37.060]   Mike Elgin, let's give a plug to Chatterbox.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:38.460]   What do you say?
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.860]   I would love to and thank you for that opportunity.
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:44.660]   Chatterbox is my son Kevin's brilliant educational product.
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:48.860]   And it's a smart speaker like an Amazon Echo, but kids build it themselves.
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:54.660]   And they program it themselves. And then after that, they have this smart speaker that's totally private.
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:58.660]   There's no way for Chatterbox or any other company to know who the user is.
[02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:03.460]   So it's unmonetizable in any other way other than after you buy the product.
[02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:08.940]   And it teaches AI literacy, which is super important because kids these days are the first generation
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:12.460]   who grew up in a world where there's a talking AI thing in their house.
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:12.860]   Right.
[02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:15.860]   So psychologically, we're not really prepared for that.
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:19.660]   And the way to teach kids what that thing is is to build one.
[02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:21.460]   So that's it.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.660]   And it's a big push for schools now.
[02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:31.860]   This year, next year rather, there's going to be Kevin's companies going to create all kinds of brilliant curriculum
[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:37.260]   to help teachers teach all these programming concepts and kids love it.
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:38.260]   It's like super fun.
[02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:42.460]   So yeah, hello, Chatterbox.com is where to go to find out more.
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:44.660]   And it's just a brilliant product.
[02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:47.660]   And I love it, but I'm biased.
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:56.060]   And how's he been able to get parts because I know it uses a Raspberry Pi, right?
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:57.260]   Yes.
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:03.860]   Well, one of the the the the voice hat part is proprietary and everything else is open.
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:06.260]   The hardest part has been Raspberry Pies.
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:08.860]   And so he's been kind of hoarding them for a long time.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:12.060]   So he's able to fill Christmas orders and stuff like that.
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:14.660]   But he's he's nervous about it.
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:18.860]   And you know, hoping that that starts flowing sooner rather than later.
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:21.260]   But that's the hardest part is the Raspberry Pies.
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:23.860]   Yeah, you can buy one off Raspberry Pies.
[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:28.260]   If you're a consumer on Amazon, if you get the kit with the with the keyboard and all that stuff,
[02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:30.460]   you can buy that and it'll cost you a hundred and fifty bucks.
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:31.060]   There you go.
[02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:37.560]   But to get but he needs hundreds of just the Raspberry Pi fours and that you cannot get right now.
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:39.260]   So he's working on it.
[02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:41.860]   You can probably get three is a little bit easier.
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:47.860]   So the other box can use three out of box works with all of them, which is which is nice.
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:54.060]   But but fortunately for schools and also people who are inclined toward this type of product,
[02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:58.060]   many of them already have a Raspberry Pi that in a lot of schools bought Raspberry Pies.
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:01.160]   Thinking we're going to teach kids about computers and they're just kind of sitting there.
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:02.260]   They don't know what to do with them.
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:02.860]   Here you go.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:05.460]   So for those kinds of schools, this is a fantastic product.
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:09.260]   He also sells the chat about with no Raspberry Pi in it.
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:13.360]   And of course for reduced price, greatly reduced price.
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:16.860]   And so schools and individuals can buy those and use the Raspberry Pi.
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:18.660]   They are so pretty great.
[02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:20.160]   That's a brilliant idea.
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:24.160]   And Gastronomat, I imagine you're sold out for Prosecco.
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:26.160]   We are not.
[02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:27.760]   We're doing a pretty big Prosecco.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:33.460]   Oh, no, we we we normally only have three couples for that one, but this time we're going to have,
[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:36.460]   I believe six couples.
[02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:39.960]   And so we already have three couples signed up, but we have room for two more couples.
[02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:42.660]   So that's going to be amazing.
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:52.360]   And so, you know, I'd recommend if people want to really, you want to really score big with your spouse for Christmas gift.
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:58.360]   As somebody who just came off your most recent Gastronomat adventure, highly recommended.
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.360]   Highly.
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:07:59.960]   Thank you, Leo.
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.360]   Yeah, I appreciate that so much.
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:02.260]   You appreciate that.
[02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:03.960]   And I had so much fun.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:05.960]   Yeah, so good.
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:08.660]   Yeah, I'll never forget it.
[02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:10.560]   It was really an amazing experience.
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.060]   You and Amira do amazing things.
[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:12.660]   Well, thank you.
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:13.960]   And your your pixel photos.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:16.960]   We are in so many low light situations because it was day of the dead.
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:19.160]   We're in a cemetery after midnight.
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:23.960]   We were in all these low light situations and your your pictures of some of the best ones.
[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:26.360]   Well, Mike is the official photographer.
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:31.660]   So I probably shouldn't show all of these because I don't know.
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:32.160]   You can.
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:32.560]   You can.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:33.260]   I totally find.
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:33.560]   Okay.
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.160]   Absolutely.
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:34.460]   Yeah.
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:42.260]   So it was, I mean, there were so many great things and you really do a great job taking pictures.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:43.660]   Thank you.
[02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:44.360]   A lot of food.
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.560]   Pick a lot of food.
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:48.060]   But there's people happy people.
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:51.060]   Here we are enjoying our final meal.
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:52.060]   That was so much fun.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:56.660]   That's a that's that beautiful church in the background across the across the cobblestone lane there.
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:02.760]   That's a beautiful spot was a really God, the food and the people.
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:04.060]   And I love a Wahaka.
[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:06.760]   I just really love the people there was just so much fun.
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:08.460]   They're just such wonderful people.
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:08.760]   Yeah.
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:09.260]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:09.760]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:11.860]   Mr.
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:13.160]   Brian McCullough.
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:14.760]   Tech.
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:15.160]   Yes, sir.
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:15.460]   Neem.
[02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:17.760]   Ride home podcast.
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:19.960]   I thought you were doing seven days.
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:21.060]   You've cut back to six.
[02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:21.360]   Huh?
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:26.860]   No, what it is is we've always done five days a week because that is the.
[02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:28.760]   What is the Friday minute?
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:29.060]   Yeah.
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:29.860]   News roundup.
[02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:30.260]   Yeah.
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:37.760]   Where it's just the news of the day and then on the weekends now, Chris Messina and vendor of the hashtag.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:38.860]   Oh, my co-host.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:39.660]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:40.660]   I love Chris.
[02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:52.960]   We we do these bonus episodes where, for example, we had the Constitution Dow folks on as I told you when Twitter launched Twitter blue.
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.460]   We had cave on on.
[02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:59.760]   Chris is really good at getting guests because he knows everybody's worked everywhere.
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:00.260]   Yeah.
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:05.960]   When when NFTs were popping again, we had some big NFT folks on there and stuff.
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:11.360]   So essentially the weekend bonus episodes are sort of deeper dives into stuff.
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:14.360]   And so that's the sixth day of the week.
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:14.860]   Nice.
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:16.860]   Oh, go give Chris my regards.
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:18.260]   I had no idea he was helping you out.
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:21.860]   That's he's a legend that created the hashtag, baby.
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:22.460]   Exactly.
[02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:24.560]   That's that's pretty good stuff.
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:30.260]   And we have a good rapport, which happened accidentally because he just started coming on regularly.
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:33.060]   And then I'm like, well, why don't we do this officially?
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:40.360]   So he's very nice officially the co-host ride home.info for the tech meme ride home podcast.
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:42.060]   It's great to have you, Brian.
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:42.860]   And of course,
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:43.460]   Thank you, sir.
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:52.760]   Alex, who is the caretaker of my childhood home, Alex Wilhelm reporter at Tech Crunchy said you're trying to have children.
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:55.660]   Yeah, that's the stage of life that I'm.
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:59.360]   I feel like I'm currently like the Alex Trebek moment on Jeopardy.
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:05.160]   And our contestant from Rhode Island, you're trying to have children.
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:08.760]   I didn't know this was a game show.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.760]   What did I win?
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:12.360]   It's always the part of Jeopardy.
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:13.360]   I skipped through.
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:15.560]   It's the contestant in your fuse.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:16.560]   It's like, who cares?
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:16.960]   I don't care.
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:18.160]   Just go back to the questions.
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:19.360]   So good.
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:20.860]   Congratulations to you and Liza.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:21.960]   You're wonderful wife.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:28.260]   I hope everything's going well in Rhode Island and tech crunch.com tech.
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:34.760]   Get the tech crunch plus feed because that's where you get the best stuff from Mr.
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:35.460]   Wilhelm.

[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:49.060]   If you are into startups and venture capital and want to hear people talk about startups and venture capital equity is for you.
[02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:51.560]   If you are not into those things, you will hate it.
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.360]   So, you know, it's it's kind of like it's either for you or it's not.
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:55.960]   Oh, we didn't.
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:56.760]   You know what?
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:58.460]   We didn't even get to talk about block.
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:04.760]   So if you want to know more about Square's new name, go listen to the equity podcast.
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:08.860]   They did my three days a week, three days a week.
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:09.860]   How do you survive?
[02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:11.560]   Join Alex Wilhelm.
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.860]   Let me try this now.
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:16.560]   Natasha Muscarrenas and Marianne as a Veto.
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:17.560]   Yes.
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:17.560]   Yes.
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:19.060]   That is our Friday day crew.
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:23.260]   I do the Monday show solo Wednesday's be niche to a single topic and Friday's our news roundup.
[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:23.860]   It's a good time.
[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:25.860]   Man, silverling joins you for that.
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:28.060]   Actually, can I just say Leo?
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:29.860]   We hit our five year anniversary of equity.
[02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:35.260]   I think in March and I am in awe of how fast time moves.
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:35.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:37.260]   That that took me by surprise.
[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:38.860]   Yeah, five years is nothing.
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:44.460]   People used to ask me when it, you know, we'd have our hundredth episode and they say, well, don't you want to celebrate that?
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:46.860]   Talk to me when we write a thousand.
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:47.360]   Okay.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:49.060]   You know, a hundred does nothing.
[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:50.160]   It's nothing.
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:53.360]   So this is Twitch number 852.
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:57.560]   According to my notes docs, who were three years away from episode 1000.
[02:12:57.660 --> 02:12:58.160]   That's right.
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.860]   And I think we're going to make it at this point.
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:07.560]   Unless the lights drop from the ceiling and hit me in the head, we shall be doing an episode 1000.
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:10.260]   Can I be on that one?
[02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:11.160]   Because that'll be fun.
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:13.360]   I deal deal done.
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.860]   Don't be on a two.
[02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:16.160]   Yeah.
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:16.260]   Yeah.
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:16.760]   You too.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:17.560]   Brian, you too.
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:17.960]   Everybody.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:19.460]   You're going to be on this.
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:22.160]   I don't know if you remember you quit earlier in the show.
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:23.160]   You retired, right?
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:23.460]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:23.860]   That's right.
[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:24.660]   Do your other company.
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:25.860]   What am I doing now?
[02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:26.960]   Blockchain.
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:28.060]   Yes.
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:28.060]   Right.
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:29.460]   Unlocking your wallet.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:32.960]   You're flipping NFTs with your resident down.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:38.360]   Actually, if I, if it took me a whole year to guess the password of my wallet, it would still be worth it.
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:41.060]   How many Bitcoin's you lose?
[02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:42.260]   7.85.
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:42.960]   I didn't lose them.
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:43.660]   I got them.
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.060]   Just can't get to them.
[02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:47.560]   It's a quarter million dollars in there, man.
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:48.360]   That's right.
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:49.660]   I get to write the press release.
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:49.960]   Yeah.
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:55.760]   A little port, the famous podcast really report retired saying he had a time with his Bitcoin password.
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:56.160]   I do.
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:57.660]   That's been one time with my wallet.
[02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:58.860]   That's true.
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:00.660]   Actually, that's true.
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:02.060]   Thank you all three of you.
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:02.660]   What a pleasure.
[02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:03.460]   Always fun.
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:05.160]   You're the greatest.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:14.860]   Thank you to all of you, our listeners, and thanks especially to members of our club, because they made this possible along with our sponsors.
[02:14:14.860 --> 02:14:18.360]   Club Twit is the way to hear ad free versions of the show.
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:26.060]   If you don't like the ads, 7 bucks a month, no more ads plus the access to the fabulous discord, which is.
[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:27.260]   Always a lot of fun.
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:31.260]   We had an event with Mary Jo Foley on Friday.
[02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:35.660]   In fact, that'll be on the Twit Plus feed, which is also part of your club Twit membership.
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:37.260]   Lots of stuff behind the scenes.
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:38.460]   Mike and Amir Algin.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:40.860]   You're going to join us next month.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:41.760]   No, this month.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:42.660]   When?
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:44.660]   I think it's next month.
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:44.960]   Yeah.
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:45.460]   Next month.
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:45.960]   Looking forward to that.
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:46.560]   That's going to be awesome.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:52.560]   And we're going to talk about a lot of stuff that we don't normally talk about in public because it's a it's a it's for the club.
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:52.860]   Right.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:53.260]   Yeah.
[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:55.860]   You're not much more open about your end with friends.
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:56.360]   Yeah.
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:56.360]   Yeah.
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:56.860]   Yeah.
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:15:03.060]   So it really is a the discord has been as it turns out the most interesting part of the club.
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:03.560]   It's great.
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:16.260]   Not only do we chat about the shows as the shows are going on, but every other possible aspect of geek life, including Stacey Higginbotham's science fiction book club, ham radio.
[02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:19.360]   There's a philosophy channel, a sport ball channel.
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:22.060]   And we'll be talking about the Twit Cruise.
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:24.660]   In fact, we want everybody who's going on the Twit Cruise to join the club.
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:29.560]   That way we can have our own private back channel when we go on that Twit Cruise in July.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:33.560]   And I would like to shout out to those of you who think you're going to miss out on the ads.
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.760]   If you join the club, you can still get the ads.
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:38.060]   There's a channel, which is what I do.
[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:39.360]   I don't want to miss anything.
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:40.060]   Right.
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:43.760]   One of the discord server things is all the ads.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:47.360]   So you can get all the ads if you want.
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:49.160]   I don't know why you'd want to, but you can't.
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:53.160]   Thank you, Mike, for that.
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:55.760]   I appreciate you listening to all of the ads.
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:59.660]   If you want to join the club, we'd love to have you.

[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.560]   Is Mike in that picture?
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:46.060]   That is my back of my head.
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:46.860]   Back your head there.
[02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:47.360]   Look at that.

[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:22.160]   That way you'll get it automatically every week when it's available.
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:25.160]   And you won't have to ever wonder what you're going to listen to on a Monday morning.
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:34.160]   Plus, if your podcast client allows reviews, please, we want to catch up with Brian McCullough's 4.7 star review here.
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:35.760]   We want five stars.
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:37.360]   So leave us a five star review.
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:44.760]   And that would help spread the word about what is, I think, now the world's longest running tech podcast.
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:47.560]   Since 2005, this week in tech.
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:48.760]   I'm Leo Laport.
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:49.560]   Thanks for being here.
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:50.460]   We'll see you next time.
[02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:52.560]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:54.360]   GM.
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:57.360]   Do the twin.
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:58.360]   Do the twin.
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:17:58.760]   All right.
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:00.360]   Do the twin, baby.
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:01.960]   Do the twin.
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:02.560]   All right.
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:04.360]   Do the twin, baby.
