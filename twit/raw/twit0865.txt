[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   It's time for Twet This Week in Tech.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.080]   I really don't need to say much about this show, except tell you who's on.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.120]   Brianna Wu is here.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.120]   Alex is here.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120]   Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.800]   Corey Doctorill of the EFF.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.040]   And of course, sci-fi novels galore.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.880]   I think this is going to be an amazing show for you.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.680]   We'll talk about Russia versus Ukraine, of course, why I can, should not shut down the
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.560]   Russian internet.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.400]   An optimist's playbook for our clean energy future will debate nuclear versus solar power.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.240]   We'll talk about Elden Ring and chess and Audible Gate and the history of the Standard
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.400]   Oil Company and the card or phone decision.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.280]   And well, it's just a wide ranging conversation.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   And I think you're going to love it.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.280]   Stay tuned.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280]   Twet is next.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:06.840]   This is Twet.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.400]   This is Twet.

[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.840]   Safety Orange.

[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.760]   Traditional audio conferencing systems can entail lots of components.

[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.200]   That's complex-pensive.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.800]   But Nureva audio?

[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.280]   It's time for Twet this week in Tech the show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.000]   Stand back, put on your thinking caps.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.320]   This is going to be a powerhouse episode.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.600]   Brianna Wu is back.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.000]   Her voice is still a little gravelly, but you're feeling fine.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.840]   You had some nodes removed from your larynx or something?
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.280]   Actually, I tore my vocal cords while I was running for Congress.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.080]   I gave so many speeches and spent so many hours on the phone fundraising that I had pain
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.480]   when I would talk for a long period of time.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.240]   You can actually listen to old episodes of Twet and you'll hear towards the end.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.880]   That sounds really, really rough.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.160]   I went to an ENT and they're like, "Well, you've got this giant hole thing."
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.120]   You tore in your vocal cords.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.320]   I had to go under a full anesthesia and they got a laser and just, you know, laser it closed.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.200]   But it takes a while for the tissues to calm down after that.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.120]   But you're not in any pain.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.720]   You sound like Patti and Samma.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.440]   But you're not a heavy smoker.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.440]   It's just...
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.720]   Anyway, great to have you back.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.880]   And people don't know, but you were scheduled on Twitter a few weeks ago and I actually kicked
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   you off.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.640]   I was mean because your voice...
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.240]   I sounded really bad.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   I really did.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.440]   I just knew that anybody listening would just be in pain for you.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.440]   Yes, 100%.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.480]   And so I didn't want them to suffer.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.680]   But I think we'll be fine now.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.920]   Anyway, I needed you because I need intellectual heft and you'll see why.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.680]   I'm bringing in all the top guns here.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.360]   Alex Wilhelm is here, a humble reporter at TechCrunch.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   Hello, Alex.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.080]   Hey, I just want to point out that I think for the first time I'm on Twitch and everyone
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.080]   on the panel, I have the least Twitter followers and I'm peeved about that.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   How many...
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.040]   Well, just how many Twitter followers do you have?
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.200]   I don't know, like 92,000 or something.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.760]   The panel is not enough.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.480]   Yeah, I'm not...
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.160]   Babe in the woods compared to this crew.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.920]   My car has got like 430,000 brianos over 100.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.960]   Look, it's got like a billion, I don't know.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   Half million.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   Half million.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.480]   The more you get, the worse Twitter is.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.160]   People don't understand this.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.360]   That's actually really true because I talk to people and say, "Oh, I love Twitter."
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.760]   I'm going, "You do?
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.080]   It's awful."
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.880]   And I think it's because you just...
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.640]   I'm too enmeshed in it or something.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.240]   Anyway, I'm not a fan.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.480]   I'm not a fan.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.060]   And third party, the one we're gearing up our intellectual, heft four, science fiction
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.000]   author, EFF spokesperson, all around...
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.400]   A man about town, Cory Doctorow, is also in the house.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.360]   And it's so great to have you, Cory.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.120]   Pluralistic.net is your new website, newish, new...
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.800]   Two years old.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.880]   Yeah, it feels new since the pandemic.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.160]   But you got to show us this shirt.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.800]   Tell us what you're getting.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   It's a...
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.120]   Gosh, and I'm just blanked on the creator's name, but I'll find it.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.720]   Someone's grad project.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.800]   It confuses automatic license plate readers and reads as like 20 cars.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.440]   But the license plates spell out the Fourth Amendment.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.160]   And then they have very cleverly arranged it.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.360]   So, and effects is here so that it says and EFF in the middle of your chance.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.960]   It looks like an EFF promo, but it's not.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   That's right.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   That's a graduate.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.760]   I should point out that I'm not a fan.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.040]   I'm not an EFF spokesman.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.800]   I am an EFF like special advisor, but I think unless I say so, please don't assume I'm speaking
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.360]   ex-catheter on behalf of the EFF.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.360]   Thank you for the correction.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.160]   We were both job buddies.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.240]   Yeah, but now there's other people.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.240]   But definitely you're involved with the EFF.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.240]   So, before we start the show...
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.000]   I wanted to tell a funny story before we start the show today.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.720]   I want to get back to the magical year of...
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.000]   I think it was 2007.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.320]   Where my husband gets a call from Corey.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.680]   And Corey asks him to do the cover to one of his books.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.720]   So I sit there and I watch Frank painting this picture of Corey Dottron.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.440]   Oh, I love it.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:52.600]   Well, he being assembled by dinosaurs week after week after week after week after week.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.160]   For Corey, it just gets weirder and weirder the further he goes.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.360]   But then we're hanging out with Corey and Frank is like, "Hey, do you want to buy the
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.360]   original painting?"
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.120]   And Corey is like, "Yeah, I'm good."
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.920]   So that's the story.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   Oh, no.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.760]   I think I said I want to raise money for it.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.960]   I don't think I said I don't want to...
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   Oh, no.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.480]   I mean, I love that work.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.480]   Yes.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.480]   Oh, it's great.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   I'll buy it.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.480]   Let's get the bidding up.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.240]   No, I don't even know where it is.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240]   I would like it.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.680]   So, it was at an auction and I think Frank said, "Do you want to buy it before we put it
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680]   up?"
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   You're right.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.480]   And I said, "No, we should auction it."
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.440]   But I had to stare at pictures of your face as he was deciding how to paint it nonstop
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.440]   for so long.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   So, it's weird seeing you in person tonight.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.440]   My apologies.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.160]   Having spent the last two years on Zoom, I know how horrible it is to look at my face
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.160]   all the time.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   We all know that now...
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   You can't regret let yourself esteem.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.960]   Yeah, we all know what that's like now.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.200]   We should also mention Corey's book, Unauthorized Bread, a radicalized novella is going to
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.520]   be the subject of Stacey's next book club in our club, Twit.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   So, that's pretty cool too.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   So, it's it all...
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.560]   And it's being adapted for As A Graphic Novel by Jen Doyle and it'll be out, I think next
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   year.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   How exciting.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   From first second.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.000]   That's really cool.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.600]   What's your most recent book?
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.360]   It's How To Destroy Surveillance Capitalism.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.120]   It's a short book about it.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   It's just a few pages.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120]   It doesn't take a long...
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.440]   I have a copy over here.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   Unionized everything.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.480]   It's basically like antitrust and interoperability.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.000]   And you know, there's a whole bunch coming.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.360]   I write when I'm anxious.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.680]   So, I have eight books coming up between now and the end of 2025.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.600]   COVID is good for the for the...
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:49.080]   The next one's a cryptocurrency heist novel coming up from tour called Red Team Blues
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.440]   at the start of 2023.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.440]   Cool.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.440]   How exciting.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.040]   Actually, the next next one is now that I think of it.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.480]   Sorry, there's another one in between there.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.360]   A book called Choke Point Capitalism, which I co-wrote with Rebecca Gibleon, which is
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.480]   about creative labor markets and why just giving artists who are in highly concentrated
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.000]   markets more copyright won't get them paid anymore.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.840]   Because all that'll happen is that the people they're trying to sell their work through
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.560]   will just demand that they sign over whatever copyright you give them.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.760]   It's like giving your bullied kids more lunch money.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.240]   Bullies just take that too.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.000]   And we have like 20 proposals for really shovel ready stuff you can do that will actually
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.520]   put more money in artists pockets instead of giving them something else to complain about.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.000]   Love that.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.120]   Brianna and I were feeling bad because both Corey and Alex have huge bookshelves loaded
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.160]   with books behind them.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   There is a difference.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.680]   Corey wrote all the books behind him.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.920]   There is a difference there.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.720]   I mean books are like pubic lice or triples.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.960]   They just kind of accumulate and agree.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   I'm not like pubic lice, but okay.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   I get the pubic triples.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.520]   I get the point.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.560]   Just don't have to feed them after midnight.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   That's all right.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.120]   I have gone to the point when my spouse whenever I get new books in the house she just kind
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.840]   of looks at me like what is wrong with you.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   You are broken inside.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   Sir.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.840]   Stop it.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.840]   No, you're not.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   You're saving the independent bookstore.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.520]   You are doing a good thing.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.600]   Does Providence still have bookstores?
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   Yes, we do.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.360]   We tried to order through books on the square.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.840]   Actually now famous in Providence because when Kamala Harris came to town for like 14
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.920]   minutes once she did go to books on the square and they had a picture of all the books she
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.880]   bought because they were so proud.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.600]   So now my bookstore was once famous.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   Nice.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.960]   And we should we should mention before the show we were talking about I was lamenting
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.680]   the death of the independent podcast and Corey brought up the fact that BBC is taking
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:46.000]   all of its podcasts which were formally open on RSS and putting them behind a sound wall
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.240]   a prior.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.760]   It's a paywall.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.760]   Is that right?
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.760]   No, it's a red wall.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   Like it's a special app.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.520]   It's basically it's basically like what Spotify has done.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.520]   You don't have to pay.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.360]   You can listen for free but you do have to use their app.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.120]   Yeah, you so it's basically saying you have to fragment your listening across more and
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.760]   more apps and they get to control how the app is presented.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.760]   It's like a big.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.520]   It's like if BBC TV could only be received on a special BBC television and you have to
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.040]   have a different television for Skye, you know.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   That'd be crazy.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.880]   Ian Thompson who's watching and will actually be on Twitter in a few weeks all credit to
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.400]   Doctorow for calling out BBC sounds podcast.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.360]   It's a shameful situation.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.520]   He's a Brit.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.520]   So yes, as am I now I thought I was going to ask because of course the top story this
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.880]   week is all a top stories are all about Ukraine.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.360]   I seem to remember.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.720]   Are you Russian or Ukrainian?
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   Both both.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.600]   No, I'm Russo, Ukrainian Polish, Belarusian and Romanian, but my passports are Canadian
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.000]   and British and I have a US green card.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.880]   But by heritage, by heritage, your Eastern European, I guess really all of that is kind
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.840]   of a mishmosh and formally, I guess I'm half Asian because my dad was born in Azerbaijan.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840]   Wow.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.200]   But of Russian parentage, Russian and polo Belarusian parentage.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.000]   And you're watching what's going on in Ukraine.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Are you torn?
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.160]   No, well, no, I know what side I'm on.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:22.920]   What's really awful is getting emailed from my family in St. Petersburg who are terrified
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:31.880]   and completely demoralized and also who just had their savings wiped out and who are looking
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.000]   at a politically destabilizing event that has no good result.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Russia wins.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   It's terrible.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.360]   It's terrible.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.480]   There is nothing good that will come up this for Russian people.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.720]   It's already terrible for your family.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.280]   It didn't take long.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.440]   And of course, that's due to sanctions from the West.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.280]   And yet, we don't have much we can do about.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.720]   I don't think I don't have a surprise, but the number of people I hear saying, "Oh, we
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.000]   should definitely create a no-fly zone over Ukraine as if that is not an action of war
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   that would end."
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   That's the beginning war.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.640]   We need the air battles between the US and Russia.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.000]   That will definitely calm the situation down.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.720]   I mean, you're right.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   There's an old joke from Ireland as opposed to an Irish joke.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.440]   An old joke from Ireland whose punchline is, "If you wanted to get there, I wouldn't
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.400]   start from here."
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:33.000]   And like neoliberal shock therapy after the wall came down, created the conditions that
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.440]   brought Putin to power, the decision to bring Putin into the world-based order because we
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:47.280]   wanted his gas wealth, his fossil fuel wealth, increased the presence of oligarchs around
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.080]   the world and their corrupting influence, and also made it harder to effectively sanction
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.160]   them because now the wealth is spreaded everywhere.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.600]   There's just like a series of missteps and some things that weren't missteps and some
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.760]   things that are definitely the fault of Russian elites and I'm not one of those people who
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.200]   says, "Well, it's definitely NATO's fault for showing up on Russia's doorstep," but
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.920]   that didn't help either.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.800]   I think you'd have to be a weirdo to say, "No, no, no.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.640]   One of the things that really stabilized that region was bringing NATO up to the Russian
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.720]   border.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.480]   That definitely calmed things down a lot."
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:29.760]   So it's a horrific situation and we are kind of like 20 years too late to have prevented
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.200]   it from happening, but as with trees, the best time to have planted a tree was 20 years
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.440]   ago and the second best time is now and the best time to actually confront some of the
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.960]   geopolitical choices that we've made that produce this outcome would have been when we
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.040]   were making them and the second best time is right now.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.200]   I mean, it's great in hindsight to say, "Well, this could have been avoided."
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.240]   But all of life is like that.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:02.040]   I mean, you do things 20 years ago that you had no idea what get you to be, for instance,
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:08.640]   a podcaster in the midst of the worst time ever for podcasting and if I had only thought
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.120]   better 20 years ago, but it's foolish to even say that because...
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.120]   No, you don't.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.680]   I want to quibble a little because I think that 20 years ago, a bunch of people did say
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.720]   this would happen, right?
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.560]   It wasn't like Richard Nixon of all people predicted this.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.720]   That is not what I thought was going to come out of your face right there.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.280]   That is not the two words I thought were coming.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.280]   All right.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.280]   All right.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   All right.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   Why did Nixon call it?
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.280]   Does he or when did he call it?
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.280]   He wrote a book in '91.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.760]   I'm going to see if I could find it.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   I saw this fleeting...
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.720]   Was the subtitle "Noam Chomsky was right about everything"?
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   Yeah, no.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.600]   It's just the one he wrote with Monica Crowley when he was trying to kind of re-find his
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   eye.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.120]   Let me see if I can find this now because I think I saw it on Twitter, which means it's
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:04.880]   long gone down the stream, but essentially he predicted the rise of the oligarchs at the
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.880]   fall of the Berlin Wall.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.440]   I mean, it was that long ago and he had a fairly similar chain of events to what you
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.200]   just described, Corey.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:23.040]   Look, Nixon probably had a pretty good handle on geopolitics and I'm not surprised he had
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   some insight into that.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.960]   Henry Kissinger probably did too.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.080]   It doesn't make them wonderful people.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.080]   Yes.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.880]   But really it's like--
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.760]   It's like a caveat up there.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.220]   Like all those people who read cyberpunk novels and say, "This sounds like a great idea
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.720]   we should do this."
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   Yes.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.560]   You've missed the point.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:48.120]   I do have to say, I really respect all the people on Twitter that over the course of
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.880]   getting their epidemiology degrees and becoming experts in biology have managed to get a
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.240]   war college and become experts.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.240]   It's amazing, isn't it?
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.240]   The experts, yes.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   Yes.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.160]   I really, I do.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.200]   I don't disagree with the premise, Corey, that we should have taken stronger actions
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.520]   over the last 20 years.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.560]   I think there's a very strong argument that generally speaking, our strategy has been
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.120]   a piece of it.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:20.360]   At the same time, it's-- I think you look at something like-- I just can't help but feel
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:26.200]   there's a large contingent on Twitter that is in the press overall that's really minimizing
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:33.160]   the risk that a no-fly zone would create if America got involved with reinforcing that.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:39.360]   I just speaking for myself, every time the subject for the United States comes up, people
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.840]   don't know this but Mississippi, my home state has more people serving per capita than
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   any other state in America.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.320]   I, like every other Mississippian, know plenty of people that served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.600]   I have specific friends that did not make it home.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:02.960]   It's really hard because I do agree that our strategy has been a piece of it overall at
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   the same time.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.640]   I'm freaking war weary.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.080]   I mean, we look at the outcome of Iraq and Afghanistan and it's really hard to see what
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.680]   concretely that we accomplished.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.200]   And I just have to be honest and say, I read the New York Times, I've read W.S.J., I've
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.000]   read Washington Post, it just seems like an epic cluster in every way.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.800]   It could possibly be a cluster.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.920]   Oh, you know, we're in vigorous agreement.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.880]   I grew up in the antiwar movement.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.800]   You know, I was arrested for blockading in arms bizarre in Ottawa.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.120]   I have important feelings about why it shouldn't be easier to arrest people who are protesting
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.920]   in Ottawa.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.320]   And I completely agree.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.720]   You know, the, the appeasement I'm talking about is doing things like saying, well, we
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.920]   should, we should bring Russia into the WTO and then we should integrate its banking system
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.280]   with our banking system.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:59.880]   And we should allow reliance on Russian gas to become significant factor in European politics.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.280]   And if we discover that all of our tax havens are being used by Russians to launder their
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.520]   money to, as opposed to just our own homegrown oligarchs, we should forbear from acting on
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.920]   it in order to protect our own homegrown oligarchs instead of using that as the basis for shutting
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.440]   down tax havens all over the world and ending the kind of financial secrecy that abets corruption
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.920]   so that we can strike at their oligarchs and ours at the same time.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.280]   Here's, I found the tweet.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.960]   This is actually a, how many, how many conversations have begun that way?
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   I found the tweet.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   I like, I like it.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.280]   Richard Nixon's Twitter account.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.000]   I think it's completely let his means are so on point.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   This is a letter.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.400]   When he gets loaded and, and just starts like posting excerpts from his like tapes of conversations.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   Let me tell you.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.640]   It's Jack Jesus staff.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   This is a letter.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:54.520]   Nixon wrote to the first George Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush in 91 and 92, arguing to
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   put more money into aid for European, for Western liberalism, lowercase L.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.440]   The West Nixon says has failed so far to seize the moment to shape the history of the
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.680]   next half century.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.480]   If Yeltsin fails the prospects for the next 50 years, will turn grim, the Russian people
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.760]   will not, this is 91.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.000]   He's writing will not turn back to communism, but a new more dangerous depotism, despotism
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.940]   based on extremist Russian nationalism will take power.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.420]   If the new despotism prevails, everything gained in the great peaceful revolution of 91 will
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:31.100]   be lost, war could break out in the former Soviet Union as the new despots use force
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.300]   to restore the quote historical borders of Russia.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:40.260]   That was actually pretty, of course, even a broken clocks right twice a day, but that's
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.900]   pretty astute actually.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.100]   I think we can see that.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.420]   And I think what Corey rightly points out is that there have been enormous financial
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.860]   incentives to kind of whitewash what is going on in Russia.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.500]   And it's amazing to watch.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.620]   Shell oil is still buying Russian gas.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.500]   I mean, no one looks at oil companies to be moral arbiters.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.500]   Now for time.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.500]   Sure.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.540]   Let's move it to tech though.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.420]   We can certainly talk about what's going on in Ukraine in a tech context.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:14.860]   In fact, it's really interesting to see how, I mean, you're seeing the Ukrainian vice
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.700]   prime minister, Mikhailo Fedorov, use Twitter.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.380]   He's using Facebook to call on hackers to step forward and help the Ukrainians in the
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.660]   fight against Russia.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:35.100]   You're seeing, you know, all sorts of Bitcoin transfers, cryptocurrency transfers to Ukraine.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.020]   It is a war in a different era.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.560]   One of the things people have been very worried about is cyber warfare, the fear that Russia
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.480]   would start to attack us and that we would attack back.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:54.120]   There was a report which has been denied by Biden's team that he was offered some options
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.900]   to bring cyber warfare to Russia, take Russia off the internet.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:05.060]   In fact, some have suggested to ICANN that they remove Russia from the DNS servers, which
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.960]   would effectively take it off the internet.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.660]   It's a very different time, even than 20 years ago.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.120]   I don't think that it's really true that removing the root servers would take Russia off the
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   internet.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.420]   The way that the time to live on those 13 roots work is it would take about, well, several
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.760]   days for that to happen and Russia could make accommodations.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.420]   They could set up their own route of trust and they could, you know, with friendly,
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.440]   large, friendly powers like China could figure out how to get around it.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.200]   So I think mostly what it would do is just establish a future in which ICANN had even
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.800]   less credibility than it does now.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.380]   It doesn't even more as an agent of American foreign policy than it is now, which, you
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.380]   know, to the extent that that's true, that's not great.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.780]   And to the extent that it's perceived is true, I think that exceeds the extent that it is
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.780]   true.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.700]   It robs it to the credibility that we actually need in internet governance.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.380]   So I'm kind of on the right side of this.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.220]   Like if it gains you nothing and costs you a lot, you shouldn't do it.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.700]   Symbolism just isn't worth it.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.340]   ICANN said our mission does not extend to taking punitive actions, issuing sanctions
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.440]   or restricting access against segments of the internet, regardless of the provocations.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.600]   I think that's fair.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.440]   Of course it was Fedorov who asked ICANN to take take rush off.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   I got it.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.680]   If you're, if you're, you know, at the pointy end of a war of aggression, obviously like
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.600]   the, these fine distinctions are not the things that are top of mind.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.920]   I don't think we should blame them for it.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:37.220]   I also think that one of our jobs as people who aren't in the fog of war is to, you know,
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.980]   listen and then not paternalistically, but, but you know, taking into account the factors
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:47.180]   that you get when you're not in imminent danger, try and think through some of the second order
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.380]   consequences and whether or not this is worth doing.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:55.380]   And I say that as someone who wants freedom for Ukrainian people and enter Russian aggression,
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.380]   the Russian troops out of Ukraine, right?
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.960]   I just think that it's the wrong way to get that.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.560]   I don't think it would get that.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.560]   And I also think what caused it.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:09.120]   One of the requests Fedorov made that was responded to was that Apple and Google removed
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.360]   their stores from Russia and they did shortly thereafter.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.760]   Is that a bridge too far?
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.240]   I'm okay with that because they're not an NGO that is in charge of the internet.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   Right.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.560]   And you know, I do think that there are some unexpected consequences.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.620]   Like, you know, the, the, I think if you're Russia, you're, you're Russian relatives in
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.620]   St. Petersburg.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.620]   And we're suffering.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.620]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.160]   And not just them, but like the standard app that's used in the region for private communications
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.900]   is signal as telegram rather, which has some deficits.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.020]   Apparently they do have an end to an encryption for group chat, but like I couldn't find
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.460]   it and neither could some colleagues of mine at EFF.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.260]   Well, it's also roll your own encryption.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.460]   It's not, it's not standard encryption.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:58.240]   We just, we just published a guide to using telegram more safely in Russia and in Ukraine.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.080]   One of the things that, or no, it isn't, they have end to end encryption, a bigger part.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.260]   And they say that they have disappearing messages for group chat, which we couldn't figure out
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.260]   how to turn on.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.020]   And they say they turned it, they started it last summer, but you know, one of the things
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.900]   that you really want, if you're in a politically sensitive environment is the ability to have
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.140]   messages just delete themselves after a relatively short period of time so that if you're forced
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:23.900]   to unlock your phone as Russians are now being forced to do on the streets, on the streets,
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.740]   that they're not exposed to that.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:31.660]   And so, you know, if you can't sideload as you can't with iOS and you want to switch
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.700]   to something that does have better disappearing messages and end to end and other features
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.460]   that would help you not just protect yourself, but protect your counterparties, the other
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.620]   people you talk to, that's now beyond your grasp.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.260]   And so it's not without its costs.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:52.340]   I am more comfortable with cutting off the app stores, but you know, for the record,
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.020]   I also think that it's completely wrong that Apple won't let you sideload app.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.820]   So you know, there you go.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:03.980]   >> I do think that if you look at the history of how Putin rose to power in Russia, people
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:10.580]   don't know this, but you know, he went to, he had, when he first rose to power, he had
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.420]   the television stations that were really not treating him very kindly.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.340]   They actually had, you know, the scene in "V" for Vendetta with a puppet that's kind of
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.140]   mocking the fictional president there.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.780]   That actually happened to Putin in Russia.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.580]   They had one of their television shows with the Putin puppet kind of mocking him.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.300]   And what ended up happening to the person in charge of that television station is they
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.140]   did what they did to many people.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.500]   They're part of political opposition in Russia.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.820]   They brought him forward and they charged him with crimes.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:46.220]   And then as he's in jail, they went to him and said, look, if you hand over the television
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.380]   station to this person's a lot more friendly to us, all of this is going to go away.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:58.100]   So I think you can't look at the legacy of how, you know, Putin rose to power in Russia
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:03.340]   and not understand that very tight control over state media is part of that.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:09.140]   For all the things we've critiqued the internet for, many times here on Twitch, I do think
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:13.700]   that giving people access to information is something the internet is obviously good
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.700]   for.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:22.020]   So any move to kind of limit that, it just, it feels, it feels like it's symbolic, but
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.420]   it also feels like it's going to aggravate problems more than it's going to actually
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   solve it.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:31.540]   Here's the video from Kevin Rothrock tweeted of political police officers in Moscow stopping
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.540]   people.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:38.940]   It's a terrifying video to see their phones and read their messages.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.140]   Just a, this is, this is, I mean, it's not new in Syria.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.780]   There were militia checkpoints that would force you to unlock your phone and look at
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.780]   your messages to figure out.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.260]   This does even look like a checkpoint.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.420]   It's just on the street as people are walking by and terrifying.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.780]   I mean, just terrifying.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:59.740]   Here's the EFF article that you talked about that worked with on with Eva Galpren.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.660]   Eva, Eva wrote it, I didn't work on it.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.540]   I just wrote a Twitter thread about it.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.420]   This is Eva Galpren is my, my colleague.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.700]   She's our head of security research.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.140]   She's done amazing work on particularly on defending women who are being attacked with
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.140]   stalkerware.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.620]   She's the reason that the app stores have removed stalkerware from their app stores
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.060]   now.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.820]   And she's from the region.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:26.460]   You know, I believe she was actually born in Russia instead of like me, whose father was
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.300]   born in the region.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.940]   And so she has a lot of family ties and she understands the local context pretty well.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.540]   And she wrote that guide to using it more safely.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.500]   Like it isn't, there is no, you know, absolutely safe way of doing it.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.860]   But there are some things you should do.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:48.140]   I mean, one of the risks to Ukrainians using group chat and channels is account takeovers,
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.620]   where, you know, the one of the things that Russia really perfected as part of their propaganda
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:58.460]   strategy under Sirkov, who was, who was Putin's, you know, sort of minister for information
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:05.500]   for a long time, was making it so that there was just so much wrong information flooding
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.260]   the zone that people gave up on knowing what was truthful altogether.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:18.060]   Like Sirkov for many years funded many opposition groups that were extremely effective at raising
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.340]   opposition to Putin.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.700]   And then he announced after several years of this that some of the opposition groups
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.620]   that were opposing Putin were actually funded and controlled by him and didn't say which
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.900]   ones so that everyone who is in any opposition group now did not know whether they were on
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.900]   the right side.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.420]   And the whole idea is to just make it so that you give up on knowing what is truthful.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.860]   You just assume that it's unknowable.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.580]   So like the strategy they've been using in the United States.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.580]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.860]   Yeah, it's a very nihilistic strategy.
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.860]   It is.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.740]   Well, the whole thing is somewhat nihilistic.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.140]   I mean, there's no, it's there's no solution.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.660]   There's no good solution, it seems.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.020]   We don't want to go to war against another nation with nukes.
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.140]   We don't we sanctions harm everybody.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.420]   I mean, as you point out, if they had access to the app store, they could download signal
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.860]   instead they've got to figure out how to use telegram securely.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:19.580]   This doesn't seem like there's any good solution, especially it's, you know what this brought
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.780]   home to me?
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:27.060]   I was watching a video of, I think it was a drug store in Los Angeles where somebody
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.100]   just went by and the counter started taking stuff and they're like, what are you doing,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.100]   dude?
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.580]   They just took stuff and they went and he left.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.580]   He's got a mask on.
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.900]   You can't, he didn't have a gun or anything.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.900]   He didn't need to.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.660]   He could just, he didn't be intimidated.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.620]   And I realized how important norms are that we think we're safe.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.060]   So we think, well, I've locked my door.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.060]   I'm safe.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.300]   No, that's a norm.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.420]   It's easy to kick down a door or break the glass.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.540]   And that's just, that's just a statement.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.540]   Don't come in, please.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.260]   It's a norm and we rely on norms.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.940]   And when somebody like Putin is completely willing to bypass norms, we're like those drug
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.660]   store clerks who go, I don't know what to do now.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.820]   You don't have to kick down the door.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.820]   Speaking of norms, right?
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.220]   He's got a bump key in his hands.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:17.220]   So just a rake, spend five, 10 minutes with some videos from the tool, the open, totally
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.220]   open organization.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.740]   Locks are meaningless.
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:20.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.980]   I will not quite know it.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.980]   Hold on.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.740]   I interrupted, Brianna.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.260]   You go and then we'll get Alex.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.260]   Sure.
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.220]   I was just, cause I'd love to know what y'all think of this.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.540]   I, you're talking of sanctions, Leo.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.020]   I had a tweak of fairly viral last week.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:44.100]   And I buy all of my knives through, through Russia, actually.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.260]   It's this guy in Russia.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:52.620]   He's a traditional blacksmith and he goes through and he hammers the ingots by hand and
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:58.380]   finds it and carves the handle out with, it's just absolutely beautiful process.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:04.780]   And his whole living is making these hand-billed knives and selling them on Etsy.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:14.220]   And I got this really, really emotional letter from him along with all customers did last
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.220]   week.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.580]   And he was saying, look, I know what these sanctions that are about to be announced in
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:25.540]   Russia that my entire business that I've built here is about to be absolutely destroyed
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.660]   and dismantled.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:33.300]   We get by on this on basically sales to the rest of the world.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:38.860]   And, you know, he begged everybody to go and place orders while they could.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:45.100]   So he would be able to basically use all of that money and send basically a bunch of
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.900]   rations to the Ukraine.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:53.220]   He talked about how he felt tremendous guilt because one of his workers had actually supported
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:59.620]   even though he was a teenager, the annexation of Crimea a few years ago.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.820]   And just really he talked about how he'd been arrested for that and how he himself expected
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.980]   to be arrested any day now.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.780]   And I wanted to know what y'all think.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:16.740]   How do we feel about companies like PayPal facilitating stuff with that seat to kind of
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:23.100]   not get around these sanctions but helping the individual Russian people that are going
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.220]   to be inadvertently harmed, but these sanctions no matter how we do it.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:32.140]   Like if these sanctions are going to be harsh enough to actually have consequences.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:38.620]   Yeah, I don't know if the end game is maybe maybe maybe the Arligarks finally get so upset
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.100]   about losing their yachts that they go take down Putin.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.100]   I don't know.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:48.140]   And certainly your family in St. Petersburg isn't going to go out to Putin's Dasha and
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.140]   take him out.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.020]   That's not that's not a viable option.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.020]   Go ahead Alex.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.420]   You can respond to if you want to Brianna or you can say what you're going to say and
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.020]   then we'll give you a chance to respond.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.500]   Yeah, well, just going briefly back.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.420]   I mean, we're talking about norms and their importance.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.780]   And one thing that I've been thinking a lot about is kind of American political journalism
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:10.260]   and the era of Trump and how norms based reporting standards were showing to be complete
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.540]   crap in the context of someone who was willing to break through all norms.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.540]   And so we're not.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:20.940]   In fact, the people who break the norms win because we are so ill prepared.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.740]   We're so caught off guard.
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.140]   Somebody like Trump.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.540]   You know, nobody's stopping him.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.820]   But to what Brianna just said about sanctions and their impact and so forth, the lens through
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.140]   which I'm trying to view individual decisions by companies and governments when it comes
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.020]   to sanctions is whom does it impact and then how much?
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.780]   And so in the case of the internet, the court was talking about earlier, I agree with them.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   I don't think it would be useful to try to disconnect Russia from the internet because
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.980]   it would be ineffective and it would also harm individuals much more than the state.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.780]   So that's kind of how I'm trying to think about what's effective versus what is essentially
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:59.660]   kind of political greenwashing, but in a political context versus an ecological context.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.460]   Something like saying no more Russian teams in our FIFA game.
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.740]   Yeah, I don't really care what well, what he is like the evil empire of the video game
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.740]   world.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.740]   It's like good job guys.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.060]   You're slightly less evil this year.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:16.020]   But like to me that that's just posturing versus taking actual action.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.380]   So the PayPal decision has much more weight to it.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.380]   Right.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.900]   So that matters more impacts more people and therefore we should really think about it.
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:27.500]   But just to make sure that I clear about this here for a hurricane Ukraine opposed to Russia,
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.500]   get them out and so forth.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   Oh, I'm not trying to be sympathetic.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.900]   Let's I don't think this needs to be said, but you know, believe me, if I could figure
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:40.020]   out how to get these lights to be, you know, the right blue and gold, I would, we're all
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.540]   in favor and supportive Ukraine.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:47.460]   But it's also reasonable to say, you know, we're certainly there's this knee jerk reaction
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:52.860]   of let's just get these rooskeys, which comes very naturally to Americans anyway.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.340]   But let's also let's also try to do something that's effective and I'm really wonder what
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.340]   is effective.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:03.380]   Would you have a guy like Putin who doesn't really suffer any consequences?
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.140]   Again, I, you know, I would say that if you wanted to get there, I wouldn't start from
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.140]   here.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.660]   You know, think about how, but that doesn't help Corey.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.660]   That means it's too.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.660]   Well, I get it.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.660]   I get it.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.100]   But again, the right time to have done this is 20 years ago and the second best time is
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100]   now.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:24.060]   But how many different regions domestically and abroad that pose these kind of chaotic
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:31.940]   problems for a decent, caring, pluralistic, solidaristic society are also places whose
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:37.660]   economy is defined by a hole in the ground surrounded by guns, which is, you know, oil,
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.460]   natural gas, mineral extraction and so on.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:50.180]   You know, there, there, I think that there is a political current that runs through economies
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:57.300]   that are defined by extraction because they don't really need to have everybody kind of
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.540]   pulling their weight in order to enrich the richest people.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.500]   Like you don't need, you know, if you think about, say Finland, right, where, you know,
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:12.140]   when they switched from, from like a pretty, you know, rural resource based low, low intensity
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:17.140]   economy to a high tech economy in Nokia went from making rubber boots to making phones,
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:22.940]   they suddenly in order to like thrive as a nation needed to have a lot of educated people
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:27.100]   who could, who weren't just chasing their next meal and who could stop and think and
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.180]   be creative and do all that other stuff.
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:35.620]   Whereas if all you're doing is digging holes in the ground and then shooting anyone who
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.620]   comes too close to the hole while you get whatever was in the hole out again, you just
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.140]   don't need everybody to come along for the ride.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:47.060]   And you know, there are exceptions, you know, Norway doesn't look like that, Scotland doesn't
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.060]   look like that.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:56.100]   But the, the at home and abroad, so many of our resource extraction regions are, are really
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.500]   politically sick.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.860]   And, you know, we're on the buy side of what they're selling, right?
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:09.260]   And so we have delayed a green transition, a renewable transition for a long time.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.460]   It's been really bad news just for, you know, our children's future and our own future.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.900]   But it's also been really bad news geopolitically, right?
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:21.460]   Like, and it's not like it's a surprise that, you know, the Saudis aren't great political
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:26.820]   allies to have, you know, and we could have, we could have done something about the necessity
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.260]   of making Saudi Arabia happy 20 years ago.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.900]   And we should have to save the planet, but also to like save our politics.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.540]   Corey, are you trying to say that a theocratic monarchy based on oil extraction is not a
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.540]   stable form?
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.500]   I'm actually going in the other, I'm going in the other direction.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.900]   I'm saying the reason the theocratic monarchy was able to sustain itself in that country
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:55.780]   is because all you need to do to make the base, the base rich is to just suck black gold
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.700]   out of the ground and sell it abroad.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:02.380]   That it's not the, like, I'm saying that the theocratic monarchy is downstream of the
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.380]   oil pump, right?
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.380]   Yes.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.420]   No, no, I was just trying to make a joke to be.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:11.220]   No, no, no, no, by the same token, just to be really clear, I think Putin style strongman
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.220]   politics are downstream of a of a of a, of a economy.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.220]   This is why I find this.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.220]   Oh, go on.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   No, go on.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   Please.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220]   I've been talking a lot.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   You go for it.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.220]   No, no.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:30.100]   I don't, to what you were saying, Corey, I saw a staff that really, really surprised
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.100]   me coming out of Russia.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.900]   I think it's linked to those kinds of extraction economics that you were talking about.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:36.900]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.500]   Putin is currently 69.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:46.020]   The average age that many Russian men live to is basically a little bit north of 60,
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.660]   which really surprised me.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:53.980]   And a lot of Putin's base of power actually ends up being women a little bit north of
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:40:03.300]   55 because they look at Putin as somebody who will basically ensure stability, whereas,
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:09.620]   you know, their husbands or the society around them because of those extraction economies,
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:14.300]   you know, they found alcohol, they didn't get health care and died of a preventable
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   disease.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:22.060]   You know, it's that extraction economy has literally taken the stability of their relationships
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.780]   and their lives away.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:28.660]   And I think that that's part of Putin's success in staying in power is kind of reinforcing
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.140]   and saying, look, stay with me.
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.820]   I will give you stability.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:32.820]   I have order.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.860]   Yeah, I won't show your pension.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.540]   We'll stay in place.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.380]   So I think that that's kind of the flip side of this.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.140]   You know, even today as we're recording this, Bisa and Mastercard have come out with some
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.020]   really, really strict aggressive policies in regards to Russia.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:53.980]   They're undoubtedly going to, you know, it's going to disrupt that kind of social order
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.860]   that is keeping him in power.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:02.300]   So I do hope that maybe some of these actions by the tech companies can basically disrupt
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.420]   his his basis of support.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.420]   I think you're right.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.420]   That's, oh, I think apart now, I'm sorry.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.420]   I'm trying to get this.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.420]   I'm just going to control.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.820]   I know I wouldn't be able to, but I'm going to try.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.220]   Ow, ow, ow.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.020]   In the old days, Twitter was just shouting.
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.020]   No, please.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.020]   No, please.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.540]   Like, I feel like the whole twit, like, like, like, gas rotation is like matured and we're
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.540]   also nice.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.620]   Um, I'll just say that I, that I was going to kind of go towards where Brianna was going
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.820]   on, on the sanctions point and the disability point.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:37.140]   And I do think that for the under 35s in Russia, who were living in kind of a dual world,
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.900]   they're having access to Western technologies and so forth and media and kind of.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.140]   And then now kind of being shown the other side of the coin and what happens with their
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.980]   stagnant leadership, I think it does destroy the myth.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:51.260]   And so I wonder if some of the dynamics that she was discussing will become unspooled by
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.500]   what's going on today.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.940]   And that's why I am not trying to say, you know, no distinctions, no to aggressive corporate
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:57.940]   actions.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:02.220]   Just let's make sure that they're targeted at what matters versus just kind of what looks
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.220]   good on Twitter.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.580]   There's a fairly brief period though in Russian and I'm no expert on this strikes me.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:12.500]   And there's a very brief period in Russian history going back 500 years where you were
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:18.380]   the normal person has had any say in what's going on, has had any prosperity even after
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.700]   the fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:24.060]   There was at least a decade of intense poverty and difficulty.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.260]   I remember being in St. Petersburg talking to somebody saying, you know, it wasn't so
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.580]   bad when I didn't have to worry about the rent.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:34.740]   Uh, you know, I, yeah, sure, I couldn't, I had no choices about my work or anything,
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.020]   but at least I didn't have to pay the rent and, you know, stuff was provided for me.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.180]   I think there is some nostalgia for the Soviet state.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.180]   It's only a brief period of time.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.700]   And then my wife was saying, well, okay, pre-Soviet's what was it?
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.060]   Well, it was, it was a czars.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.780]   It was, it was surfed them.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:56.340]   There's only, there hasn't been a long history of, of people being able to live their lives
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.820]   without being under the boot in, in Russia.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:04.220]   And you know, in that period of, of kind of neoliberal shock therapy after the wall came
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:10.380]   down, the mortality among men was so high, you know, working age men was so high and it
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.900]   was mostly alcohol and violence related.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.140]   It's really hard to overstate how destabilized the country became.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.020]   And of course there have been multiple crashes of the ruble as well.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.140]   So whatever wealth people did manage to save was wiped out repeatedly.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.940]   And then there was just rampant gangsterism.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.780]   So my great uncle and aunt, my great uncle ran, um, was the curator of the pop-up of
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.700]   museum, which was the, it's equivalent to the computer history museum.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.900]   And they got a little money from my grandmother and opened a dry cleaner.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:42.740]   And one day they literally got a phone call from a guy who said, hi, this is the crime
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.820]   gang, the mafia.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.500]   Your location is very good.
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.500]   It's now ours.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.700]   And if you ever show up there again, we'll murder you.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.420]   And then they didn't have it anymore.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.420]   Right.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:58.580]   And so that kind of instability, combined with, you know, massive wipeouts of, of whatever
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:07.060]   wealth you saved and completely, um, you know, unstable and, and, uh, unreliable pension
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:11.220]   system really, I mean, has people in a, in a bad place.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.900]   And you know, it is one of the things that paves the way I think for strongland politics.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:21.380]   You can see parallels to the rise of Trump and people's concern about instability and,
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.820]   and the insufficiency of the social safety net and just feeling insecure and feeling like
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.500]   their kids and their own lives are bad.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.700]   And it's a vicious circle.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:34.260]   I mean, uh, once the rule of law starts to fail, it fails fast and be people because
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.060]   it's, it's a terrible vicious circle.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:42.820]   And that's why it's so important that we have this sense of fairness and of, uh, the
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.220]   impartiality of the courts and all this stuff.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:49.300]   And when you start to undermine that, it's all downhill from there.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.340]   So I want to, I agree.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.980]   I want to throw another concept here, which is living standards.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:57.540]   And I'm thinking about, um, the United States into the, the Trump era, if you will, as Corey
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.300]   just pointed out Russia into this current era and then also China in the last 15, 20
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.300]   years.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.940]   Um, what happens when living standards start to plateau?
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:09.300]   It does seem to be that you end up with a strong man type person either getting two power
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.860]   or taking advantage of it, try to distract from what's going on.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.460]   And so we've seen, uh, an enormous crackdown in China in the last couple of years as they're
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.580]   dealing with population issues and a lot of other problems as well.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:24.100]   Russia kind of capped out because the oil economy didn't have legs to grow forever.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.900]   And so now we're here having Putin kind of shake things up and then we had Trump in the
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.700]   United States based on what Corey pointed out earlier.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.060]   So there's a, there's parallels here that we should have applied and pay more attention
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.060]   globally.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.060]   Absolutely.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.100]   It's happening all over the world.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:40.740]   Uh, and I would say, I would, I would tweak Alex, your, your formulation there and say
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:48.420]   that where you have systems that are, um, parochial and aren't interested in the common
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:53.460]   public good, but just in the good of, of elites, what you end up having is you have these windows
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.500]   in which you are generating wealth and in which you're, you know, money is coming in
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:02.260]   be from your oil or whatever, but instead of reinvesting it in capacity, right?
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:06.820]   Instead of turning Nokia from a rubber boot company into a phone company, you're just
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.780]   letting billionaires buy yachts with it, which when the oil runs out, you know, and that,
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.900]   I think like Brunai would be a really good example of this, right?
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:19.740]   Where the, the salt and like at one point owned an aircraft carrier with 150 supercars
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.340]   on it that all rusted out because he forgot that if you put all your cars out to see that
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.460]   they'll all rust to nothing, you know, he's never lived in Boston.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.660]   Apparently would have learned something.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:35.820]   But, but, but there is a positive note here, which, uh, I mean, if, if anything positive
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:40.380]   comes out of this, it does, and some have said Putin has awakened Western liberalism
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:45.540]   with a lowercase L, which he had already said was, was dead.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.420]   Trump mistook that for something else, but we'll, that's another story.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:51.500]   And, and maybe we will adjust our energy policy.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.940]   This might be an opportunity for us to say, hey, yeah, maybe that was a bad idea funding
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.500]   all these holes in the ground.
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.580]   Maybe we should look at renewables.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.220]   You know, maybe we'll do it for the strategic purpose of not being dependent on others for
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.220]   whatever reason.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.780]   Maybe there'll be a positive outcome to this.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.940]   Can I ask a question about this?
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.180]   Brianna and Corey, and I'll give everyone's view on this, uh, nuclear power, where to
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.180]   be sent on that.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:21.060]   I'm on the, but I do understand that amongst, um, RT, there is a dissension in the ranks.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.620]   So I'm curious where we stand on that because I'm really pissed off that people are like,
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.620]   Oh, oil is a problem.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.620]   Russia.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:26.620]   Let's drill more oil.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.020]   Are we going to do Israel after this?
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.020]   Yes.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.620]   I'm a, I'm a state first.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:31.620]   I'm a get it.
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:32.620]   I'm a get it.
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.500]   Uh, all you have to do is look at that fire in Ukraine that almost created another Chernobyl
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.380]   to know that nuclear power is not designed to survive everything.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:41.380]   Okay.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.380]   Problem number one.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:47.340]   Second, we get a huge amount of power from the sun.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:52.260]   Every day there are very good technologies for converting that into every bit of energy
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.820]   we will ever need.
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.580]   I don't think there's any reason to flirt with something that is potentially dangerous
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:02.300]   when there is, there are so many good choices in renewable energy right now.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:07.860]   I understand nuclear has the one benefit of zero emissions, but I don't think that makes
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.540]   it the right way to go.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.540]   That's just me.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.540]   Talk me out of it.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.540]   That's fine.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.500]   I'm not the smartest guy on this panel by any means.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:18.620]   We have one pro from me and one con or one negative from from Leo.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.620]   So Corey Briana, what have we got?
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.260]   Oh, I want to grab that hot potato.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.620]   I'm generally pro.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:30.440]   I think that, um, yeah, one of the things I saw running from Congress is I was really
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:36.420]   surprised that there were a contingent of people that were really, really, really anti
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:43.100]   nuclear power, just, just as a blanket statement and would not vote here in Boston based on
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.740]   any other issue.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:52.140]   And, you know, to me, I think if you really drill deeply on energy policy, all of it except
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.340]   for renewables gets really, really messy very, very quickly.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.740]   Do you know who's opposed to fracking in a really aggressive way?
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.640]   Pudent because so much of the mind is getting natural gas.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   Exactly.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   100%.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.280]   So, you know, I think the reality is sometimes when we talk about politics, we want to wave
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:16.040]   our magic wand to pretend we can create these systems from the, from the ground up.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.400]   I think rather than that, it's a series of singles and doubles that kind of move us in
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.200]   the policy direction that we want to go.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:28.000]   So to me, the question is, you know, like care of Massachusetts, we use a ton of natural
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.180]   gas to heat our homes, would move into something that nuclear be a step forward from an emissions
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.180]   standpoint.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.280]   I think so.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.540]   So I'm in favor of anything that moves us in that direction.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:46.060]   Though obviously, as Leo was pointing out, a pure green energy policy would be much better.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.060]   That was great.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.060]   Have you ever run for office, Briana?
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.060]   Yes, I have.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.060]   Yes, I have that off the head off the car.
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.060]   Sorry, go to you.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:50:01.880]   I would say that I feel a lot, I feel a lot the same about nuclear as I do about GMOs in
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.980]   that I don't see anything wrong with that.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.820]   I don't think that it's insurmountable to build a system to manage and regulate them
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.820]   safely.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:14.040]   I just don't trust the system we have to manage and regulate it safely.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.320]   And in part, it's about when the case of nuclear about the actual history of nuclear,
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.480]   like so the recent and long run history of how nuclear is managed.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:28.000]   Now you have to look at Three Mile Island, Fukushima or Chernobyl and say, "Oh yeah,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   this is a good thing.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.440]   Let's do more of that."
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:36.240]   There's a lot of privatized gains and socialized losses and nuclear power.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.320]   And there's a lot of too big to fail.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:44.560]   Let's not, you know, where inspectors are kind of suborned because you can't not running
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   the new term.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.800]   Would you be in favor of it if it were a perfect system?
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.160]   So if, yeah, if it were a perfect sure.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.560]   I mean, I'll say this, if you believe in carbon sequestration, which I don't, I think that
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.960]   it's a pipe dream.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.600]   But if you do believe in carbon sequestration, you should believe in nuclear power at least
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:07.560]   as far as the waste is concerned because carbon sequestration means storing billions of tons
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:11.840]   of something for as long as we would have to store like swimming pools worth of nuclear
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.840]   waste.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:17.720]   And so if you think we can do one, then you necessarily think we can do the other.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.560]   There's a book by David Kay called Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air, which is, it's
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.700]   not a popular science book, it's a popular engineering book.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:30.960]   So it presents all of these things as engineering parameters like here are the number of photons
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   that strike the earth every day.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.720]   That is your maximum theoretical solar budget, right?
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.080]   Here are the herbs exerted by the moon on the earth.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.160]   That is your maximum tidal budget.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.680]   And then here's how much carbon we think we can have.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.120]   And here's what we think happens with each half degree and how much carbon gets you.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.760]   And like, here is the most theoretically perfect airplane and how much energy it needs.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.520]   And so on, he's like, you just need to move the sliders around.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.000]   You have to decide what your priorities are.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.400]   And then you come out with an answer.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.880]   Is it conceivable you could do it with just the, with renewables entirely?
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.160]   So I'll, I'm going to paste a link into the chat.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.440]   Maybe you guys can put it up here.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.760]   Saul Griffith, who's, you know, lovely chap.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.240]   He won the MacArthur prize.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.480]   He wrote a book called Electrify that came out last year about a clean energy transition.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:23.360]   And although he favors nuclear, he says that it's politically too hard to make happen.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.480]   And so we should do a green energy transition without it.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.240]   And then he says it's possible.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.000]   So he says it would be easier with, with nuclear, except for the political hurdles.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.160]   And he says that, you know, as between like convincing people that they're wrong about
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.640]   nuclear and saving the planet from catching fire, we should just focus on saving the planet.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.680]   And we don't need to convince people about nuclear to save the planet.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.920]   So it's a very, very good book.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.440]   What's the name of it again?
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.320]   It's called Electrify, an optimist play book for our clean energy future.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.920]   And I, I paste it into the chat.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.000]   I don't know if you can get that.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.520]   Which chat did you paste it into?
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   Zoom chat.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.440]   I have no access to that.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.960]   I can't see it either.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.040]   IRC is the only chat you could paste to.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.760]   But I can, I can find it.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.520]   That's fine because you get it.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.520]   I'll, I'll tweet it.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.520]   I'll just tweet it with.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.120]   Now we've, now we've reduced to tweeting.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   That's it.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.120]   It's over.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.120]   And it's like, I'll tweet live, right?
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:18.400]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna take a break and we'll figure it out, but we will post, we'll post
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.760]   it in the show notes.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.880]   Anyway, I am so thrilled to have you guys.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.200]   There's still lots more to talk about.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.800]   In fact, we've really barely scratched the surface, but this was a great conversation.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.240]   And actually something that I've been trying to understand myself.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.880]   So I'm glad we could talk about this.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.840]   Corey Doctorow is here.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:39.600]   His, his website, you've got to subscribe to his newsletter, pluralistic.net.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.960]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.360]   It's great reading at Doctorow on the Twitter.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:50.040]   Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch at Alex on the Twitter.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.200]   And of course, Brianna Wu, who's no longer Space Cat Gal.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:54:01.520]   She's actually using her name on the Twitter, like a grown up executive director of rebellionpack.com.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.120]   Elden Ring speed runner.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.600]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   All right.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.960]   So today brought to you by Noreva.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.520]   We're getting back to work.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.520]   It's so cool.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:14.960]   In fact, in a couple of weeks, we're gonna have an all in studio, Twitter for the first
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.680]   time in, I think, a couple of years.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.320]   Maybe you're starting to get back to work.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:23.480]   You've got your, your video conferencing room, but there's still some concerns.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.960]   You want to have good audio for your conferencing because there's still some people working from
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.600]   home, probably always will be.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.520]   You still want to have some social distancing.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.160]   So you could put in a traditional conferencing system.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.480]   First of all, hugely expensive.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.840]   Why is it expensive?
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.360]   Well, you got to have, you got to design it.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.680]   You got to bring in engineers to measure and design it.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.400]   There's all these mics and speakers.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.320]   You got to put in DSPs.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:54.400]   It is a complicated thing to do a traditional conferencing room.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.240]   And by the way, even after you install it, it costs you because you've got to have it recalibrated
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.120]   all the time.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.920]   Look, the industry's been ready for some time for a better way of doing your conferencing,
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.800]   a better way of audio and conferencing.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.640]   And that's Noreva.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:14.400]   Noreva created the revolutionary microphone mist technology.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   It's like a sound bar.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.560]   In fact, you can see it on the screen if you're watching the video.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.560]   It looks like a sound bar.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:24.120]   It's got one or two integrated microphones and speaker bars.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.840]   You put in one or two integrated microphone and speaker bars in a room, depending on
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.680]   the size of the room.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.080]   And then the microphone mist technology fills that room with virtual microphones, thousands
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.600]   of them, which means there's no dead zone.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.440]   You can face any way you want.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.760]   Everyone can be heard clearly everywhere in the room.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:47.600]   Meeting and class participants just talk, move naturally, socially distanced if they want.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.200]   There's no microphones to clean, no wires.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   Everybody's hearing everybody.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.760]   It actually transforms the conference call.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.600]   And thanks to continuous auto calibration, your rooms are always ready with optimized
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   audio.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:05.480]   Nobody has to come in with a decibel meter and measure or anything.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.920]   And the installation you could do yourself if you wanted to.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.440]   It's a 30 minute DIY job.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.800]   If you ever put in a sound bar, it's that easy.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.840]   That means big savings on time and cost.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:15.960]   We just have Burke do it.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.360]   That's all.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.320]   And the management, you'll love this.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.880]   Your IT department will love it anyway.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.880]   You get an orava console, which gives you the power to monitor, manage and adjust the
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.680]   system anywhere.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.880]   You don't have to go to the room.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.160]   You don't have to go from room to room.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.720]   So if you have many rooms, this IT will love it.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.440]   Look, ask yourself, do you want to go with that old school system that really doesn't
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:42.160]   work that well and is very inflexible or do you want to try something modern?
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.680]   Do you want to go with a costly, complicated traditional system or make the leap to simple
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.200]   and economical?
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.960]   You got to take a look at Noreva.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.960]   Save money, get better sound.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.960]   Everybody's happier.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:57:00.000]   And you are evna-rava.com.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   It's so easy to do.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Go look at the website.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   You'll see.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Noreva.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.800]   We thank Noreva so much for supporting our show this week in tech.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:12.840]   Noreva.com.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.560]   I was telling you before the show, Brianna.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:19.440]   I wanted to go into Michael, our 19-year-old's game room.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.880]   He's playing Elden Ring on the PlayStation 5.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.880]   I'm looking at it.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.880]   I go, "Is that Elden Ring?"
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   He said, "Yeah."
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.960]   He said, "If you beat the boss," he said, "No."
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.960]   But he's played all the Dark Souls games.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.160]   So I know he's really good at that.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.080]   I set it up on my system.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:42.520]   I didn't even get past the character design stage because it wants you to use one of those
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.520]   things that kids use.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.600]   To control or is that what they call it?
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.600]   To play the game.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   I believe so.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   It's all thumbs.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.040]   I don't want to use a keyboard and mouse like a human being.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   Wow.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.040]   Look, I'll look...
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   I'll judge me on all there.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   Oh my goodness.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:02.320]   All right, look, Brianna, I know in the background of your shot there are a number of classic
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.320]   gaming consoles.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.320]   I think I can see them.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   Yeah, there's an SNES.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   That's correct.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.320]   That's correct.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   Yes.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   And I respect that.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.080]   But with no attention to the shark coming over the sofa though, that's not part of it.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.080]   I'm trying to be very focused.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.200]   That's a short go.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:21.960]   I'm just saying that everyone knows that controller complexity matters for in-game kind
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   of control.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.800]   And I have a PlayStation and I have an Xbox and they're both fine.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.600]   But when it comes to granularity, you need a keyboard.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.600]   You need a keyboard.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   Yes.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.440]   And also, if you want to aim, a mouse is great.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.040]   And so to me, we've already invented the wheel.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.920]   Everyone's trying to make crappy kind of like worse wheels.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   And I'm not here for it.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.040]   Dark Souls is at its heart a constant.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.040]   It's a console game.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.040]   I think that's really the truth of it.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:48.640]   Yeah, I think, I mean, if you're playing an FPS, I'm 100% there with you.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.280]   Like that should be keyboard, mouse, native.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:55.360]   It's just I put so many hours into this and I'm trying to.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.720]   Are you going to speed run it?
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:57.720]   Are you going to?
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.720]   I know you're going to.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.720]   Oh, 100%.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.720]   Are you really?
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.720]   What's it figuring out how to break?
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.520]   How many years is it going to take you?
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.520]   Oh, no.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.120]   You figure out the exploit.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:11.960]   Someone right now is figuring out some luck stat booster that will let you one shot
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.160]   everyone in the game.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.120]   I'm just going to let them.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.480]   Is that red red running behind you?
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.760]   No, this is this is Dark Starkers.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.600]   That's a very famous CPS CPS to Capcom game.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   GGA, Mr.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:26.600]   Nice.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:29.560]   I don't know if you know this is field programmable gate array.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:34.880]   They've actually figured out how to accurately recreate the original arcade hardware on a
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.880]   little 300 bucks.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:41.760]   But no, I was just I was just going to say I don't think that I'm I'm
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.480]   open to alternate kinds of input.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.920]   I just don't think that would be ideal for this particular game because it's not about
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.720]   precision aiming.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.320]   It's about precision timing.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.880]   It's like roll, duck and roll and jump and all that stuff at the right time.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.600]   Yeah, because the bosses have their rhythm and you have to understand and interact with
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   the rhythm.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   It's basically guitar.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.600]   It's guitar hero for video.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600]   Right.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:12.560]   Here's here's the book electrified by saw Griffiths MIT press an optimist playbook for
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.840]   a clean energy future and I will absolutely buy a copy.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.440]   And I hope that people in the corridors of power read it.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:27.080]   I despair, frankly, since they seem to be more interested in it picking over ridiculous
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.800]   issues like I don't even want to bring it up.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.280]   Dr. Seuss.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.200]   Like Dr. Seuss before we get on to serious things.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   I'm going to be saying I'll bring for one second.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   Yes, please.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.200]   Please.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.440]   No, hey, never say let it be said.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.640]   Elden Ring is not serious.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.560]   Look, I'm a gamer, big fan.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.600]   I'm mostly a strategy computer or PC guy, but like I have consoles.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.000]   So, Brianna question, I have the little or Xbox, the new one, the white one, but not
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.360]   not the good one.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.360]   No one has them.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.840]   And I play Elden Ring on the crappier current Xbox 100% don't even stress it.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   It's not.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.440]   This is not a game where you're like graphically, I understand it's impressive.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.120]   That's not the point of the game.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.760]   Just prioritize it for frame rate.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.520]   You're going to have a great experience from a person with a 1992 Capcom game running in
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.360]   a track mode on her TV behind her.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.360]   Okay.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360]   For enormous television.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:25.760]   I live with a very, very, very serious gamer.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.640]   My wife used to play Quake for England.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640]   And really?
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.640]   That's the coolest thing I've heard of.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.640]   There was an English team.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.640]   There was an allingly.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   She took the world.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.640]   Wow.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.880]   So she has fallen down the back for blood rabbit hole.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.520]   It's left for dad, but harder.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.000]   And she's got a crew of three friends that she plays with.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   And she just, she plays with a headset, but she just screams into the headset, you know,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.880]   encouragement and curses and whatever it takes over our living room every night.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.880]   And it's how she's been socializing.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.880]   She's really very good at it, as you would imagine.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.280]   But it's pretty fun to watch.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.560]   It's, it's, I don't know that I would ever actually play it, but speaking of some with
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.000]   a lot of experience watching someone else play a lot of video games.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.280]   I give it, I give it top marks.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:16.520]   Actually that's a question we've been asking of late is why has an e-sports taken off,
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.040]   especially during this time of COVID?
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:26.440]   And when will there be, when will there be that game that everybody wants to watch?
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.440]   Maybe it's back for blood.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.840]   The neat thing about these zombie games is the co-op mode, right?
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.960]   You're playing with a group of other people.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:33.960]   You're doing it together.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.560]   You're living through this experience together.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.800]   She's playing with people who are not in the room, right?
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800]   They're...
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.880]   She's playing against friends who are remote.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.040]   But it's co-op, yeah.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.920]   I mean, I think this is, I think that's a good start towards a game that you'd want
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920]   to watch.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920]   There's a team.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.160]   So, on your, on your e-sports point, I think we've already reached the point of kind of e-sports
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.960]   maturity, because one thing people kind of forget is how old League of Legends is now.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.400]   League of Legends is a game that I played in college, and now I'm going bald.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.640]   So like, it's been around for a minute.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.880]   And the way that I think about it is, it's kind of like the NBA.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.320]   Like the NBA is an enormous deal.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.520]   I have friends who watch basketball religiously.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.000]   I'm on group chats with them.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.840]   They send memes that make no sense to me, and they're rabid fans about it.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.320]   And if you don't watch basketball, you have no idea.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.320]   And somebody, it's kind of established that people know about it.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.320]   But like, no one watches it if you don't.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.640]   If you had somebody had to sit down and explain the rules of baseball to you.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.440]   Three hours later, you'd stand up befuddled and say, well, I don't know why anybody watches
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.440]   that game.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440]   I feel that way about cricket.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.760]   I'm sure your wife doesn't, Corey.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760]   Yes.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.840]   But it's just not a cricketer.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.200]   But, but I just had to explain baseball to my daughter who was born and raised in the
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.720]   UK and moved here when she was seven, and just never had anyone explain baseball to
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.720]   her.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.000]   And she came home from like, Target with a plastic baseball bat in a ball.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.120]   And said, let's go hit it out in the backyard.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.760]   And I was like, okay, do you know how to play like, do you know?
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.160]   She was like, okay, here are the bases.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.880]   And I'm like, okay, explain how the bases are.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.880]   She's like, I'm not sure.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.240]   There's what an out is, you know, and it was, it was pretty fun.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.840]   Actually, it's like me in a wicket.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.840]   I don't understand.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.000]   And I really don't understand a game that could go on for days.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.280]   It's beyond, beyond me.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.480]   So I think if you're looking at, you know, the most serious East Force, which would be
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.080]   fighting games, you know, we've had fighting in communities since, you know, 1992 and
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.560]   Street Fighter II coming in.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.880]   So do people watch it?
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.760]   Like, would they sit in an arena and watch it?
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.920]   This is kind of my point that if you look at fighting games, the problem with fighting
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.920]   games is they've gotten more and more and more complex over the years.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:40.320]   And if you ever watch an East Force broadcast of Evo, which is essentially the, you know,
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.000]   it's a super bowl of fighting games.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.920]   It's like, who's the best player that year?
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.040]   You almost have to have a PhD in fighting games to understand what they're talking
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.040]   about when it comes to like frame advantage and things like that.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:05:00.000]   One of the things on Twitch that I think East Force have really missed the bar on is
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   that the most popular people that stream games on Twitch are very interesting personalities.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.600]   So it tends to be less about this very, very high level play.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:17.800]   And it's more about these interesting personalities or girls, not tubs in some cases, but more
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.760]   about the people that are actually bringing you the content.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.900]   So that's one form of East Force would be Twitch or the Let's Play content on YouTube.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:25.900]   That kind of thing.
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.920]   Here's a picture of Evo being played in front of a live audience.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.920]   Right.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:35.200]   For some reason this to me seems more like what, you know, in an arena, what an East
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.520]   Force, but I guess it doesn't have to be that way, does it?
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:42.720]   I mean, we will by far more NFL hours are what's spent watching an NFL on at home and
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.000]   on a screen than in the end.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.040]   But the difference in the NFL and Evo is like, Eva just had to be acquired by Sony because
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.680]   it's not doing super well financially, right?
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:06:00.760]   Fighting games have gotten so insular with the skills it takes to play them successfully.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.600]   The problem I think with these sports in general is it's so stratified.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.320]   It's so niche oriented.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.600]   It looks like the MOBA games like League of Legends or Dota 2 seem to have a very, they
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:17.080]   seem to be well suited to East Sports, I guess, because you have teams who can compete and
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.080]   you can see the teams and you can have personalities.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.080]   But I think it's stratified.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.080]   It's totally both together.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.080]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.040]   Well, I just, I think that that's the problem with the gaming in general is that the console
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:32.200]   gamers, you know, the keyboard guys don't like the, what do they call us?
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.200]   Controllers?
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.000]   Is that what they call them?
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   Handsets?
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Okay.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   But like think about it this way.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.600]   But isn't this the, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:45.840]   I was going to say just isn't this the normal life cycle of a game?
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.760]   Like I'm just thinking of Dungeons and Dragons, right?
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.280]   Which just went through this, you know, period of increasing complexity, increasing complexity
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.840]   and then it kind of collapsed when they refactored the rules because they just realized that
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:01.520]   it's too hard to, the only way to be a D&D player was to have been a D&D player for 20
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.520]   years.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.520]   Right.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.760]   And they, they were starving their pipeline.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.960]   And I just wonder if that's not, you know, in the nature of, of all of this stuff that
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.800]   it just gets more esoteric a bit like, you know, if snowflakes are falling down on a,
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:19.160]   on a snowbank, you know, little bits of complexity and each snowflake is no big deal.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.720]   But eventually the whole thing becomes so unstable that you have an avalanche and then
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.560]   you get a new stable configuration in the form of something very simple again, you know.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.120]   So here's the, here's the counter argument.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.240]   Chess hasn't changed in a thousand years.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.480]   You don't play three dimensional battle chests.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   Okay.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:41.280]   I mean, I have, it wasn't good.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.280]   Some games have, I don't know, cause they're perfect or what, but they, it's interesting.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:51.120]   I thought chess was going to be over 20 years ago when a computer beat the world champion
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:57.880]   shortly thereafter there, there, it was easy to find on your phone, a chess game that no
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.520]   human could beat.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.440]   I mean, it's really gotten to that point.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:07.040]   They're now just, you know, chess games with ratings well over 3000 and no human is that
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.360]   high, even Magnus Carlson.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:15.560]   So, and that has not killed the game, interestingly, we found a way to coexist with the robots.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.680]   We let them coach us and we work with them.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.560]   I think that's closer to like Super Mario, the original S SMB on NES, you know, like this
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:30.080]   is a good game, but it's still religiously played today by speedrunners because of the
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.080]   historical importance.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.360]   Yeah, but you made it a new game with the speed running, right?
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360]   That's a different.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360]   100% yeah.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.480]   So you're playing the same game, but it's a different goal.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.240]   I think that in chess, what has happened, I'm not, I'm not a chess expert, but I, what
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.160]   I've heard has happened in chess is there is a new kind of play, which is when a human
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.680]   and a, and a machine learning system play against another human in a machine learning
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.760]   system, they call it the centaur play, you know, where you're half person, half machine.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.800]   And that that apparently makes for a really challenging and interesting game.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   That's it.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   I have not seen that.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.520]   I mean, you know, we just had the world chess championship, which was between two humans
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.480]   a couple of months ago, and that was played.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.840]   So effect, there's very strict rules and it's a real problem in chess of cheating with
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.040]   a guy goes up and goes to the bathroom and looks at his phone and then said, comes back
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.240]   in place.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.640]   But so they have very strict rules to prevent that from happening.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:30.280]   Nevertheless, a lot of the preparation, almost all the preparation and a German play and
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.680]   stuff is done with the kind of human machine interface.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.880]   The machines are very, very good at finding the best move, but it's not often, it's often
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:43.040]   not an intuitive move or a move a human would make.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.720]   It's really interesting actually to watch this happen.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:52.760]   It might give us some insight into what the future holds for AI in general and an AI human
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.240]   interaction in general.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.520]   I think Magnus Carlson, though, with his excellent hair has also just a very good hair.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520]   Kind of kind of a boost.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.520]   If you look at any computer, yeah.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.160]   No computer has ever had good hair in the history of computers, but he brought personality
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.120]   brought pizzazz to it, if you will.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:16.640]   And I think that's helped chess grow because personalities combined with skill based sport
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.360]   are what drives you're exactly right.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.160]   And critically, the NFL, the up close and personal is the phrase.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.400]   It's how they make the Olympics at all interesting, especially the Winter Olympics, where there's
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.760]   not head to head competition, you get the athletes up close and personal so that you
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.800]   care about the person and writing a piece of metal down.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.960]   I have to say, I beg to differ on whether computers have ever had good hair.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:46.240]   So back in my, in the old days, you know, when, when I was a smoker and my ex had a long
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:52.720]   hair main coon and all of that was ingested into my match.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.960]   I would open it up once a month and remove a kind of nicotine, stiffened dreadlock.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.680]   That was an inverse mold of the inside of my computer.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   Oh my god.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.880]   For certain values of good hair, that was pretty good hair.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.880]   All right.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.760]   So first of all, we've all switched to vaping now.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.240]   So like no one smokes inside.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.280]   This is the 1400s.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.720]   But I want to, I want to circle back all the way to the point of complexity and the
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.720]   global image.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.080]   Leo can't let it go.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.200]   It's like a mullet in your computer.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.920]   The nicotine mullet, Liam, it's even better.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.520]   Well all mullets are nicotine soaked.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.760]   I think that's okay.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.760]   It's fair enough.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.340]   I did on the points about rules getting more complex inside of a game and having that
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:34.340]   make it less fun.
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.560]   I think the NFL is a great example of this because now whenever a player makes a catch,
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.560]   they run 48.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.760]   Oh, it's to see exactly where it's very easy.
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.360]   It is so crazy.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.680]   So yeah, I think that has happened.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.680]   That has happened.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.480]   I think there is a tendency in that direction.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.320]   I don't know why chess hasn't, that hasn't happened to chess.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.560]   It's not a judged sport.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.560]   That's the thing.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.560]   It's not ref.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.560]   There's no referee.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560]   Essentially.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.560]   So the referee is no one's making value calls.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.760]   Essentially, if you make value calls, the sport's very different.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.120]   So like an extreme example, this is like competitive drifting, which is all just judged
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.200]   kind of like how well you did and like skating and so forth.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.800]   Chess is kind of the other end of that.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800]   It's just beautiful.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:13.160]   Yeah, I would say playing chess and competitive drifting are about as far apart.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   As you can get.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.400]   And yet both make great sports on Twitch.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:24.560]   Hey, do you know, I once I once saw an actual chess boxing match, bringing it back to Russians.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.160]   I was at a science.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.400]   Clearly there was vodka involved as well.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.400]   Okay.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.200]   So yeah, non France and they had these these Russian guests who were competitive chess
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.360]   boxers.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.920]   And the way that chess boxing works is you have one little skinny guy who's a great chess
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.280]   player and a great big bruiser who's an amazing boxer.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:49.280]   And you play one volley of speed chess and then you get up and you do one round of boxing
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.000]   and then you do one volley of speed chess and you do and it's basically a race to see whether
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.320]   the big guy can can can cuss the little guy before the little guy can make him.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.760]   It was it was definitely the sport of Kings.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:03.760]   This is amazing.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.760]   Wow.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   This is like the by Athlon.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.680]   You're going to ski and then we're going to hand you an assault rifle.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:14.160]   They play chess and now they're getting up and they're going to punch each other.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.080]   This is like an SNL skit.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.080]   Look at this.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.920]   It is like something somebody made up.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.920]   It really is.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.920]   Oh my God.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.720]   I was supposed to a chess which came down off a mountain on two stone.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.720]   What?
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720]   I think so.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.400]   I don't want to say anything, but I think so.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:36.040]   The chat room is telling me that that Magnus Carlson's ratings about 2845 and stockfish,
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.040]   which you can download.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.040]   It's free.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.480]   It is about 3500.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.600]   So there's a big big difference.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.600]   Effectively, you can't beat.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.560]   No human alive can beat stockfish.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560]   At chess.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.560]   It's quite interesting.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.040]   Meanwhile, the boxers are still finding it out.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.200]   I don't want to get a YouTube takedown by the chess boxing counsel.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.480]   So I'm going to conclude.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:04.080]   This is this is the world chess boxing championship.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.240]   A match no one will ever forget.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.280]   By the way, I just want to point out two and a half million people have watched this video
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.280]   on YouTube.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   That's because they're all like us.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280]   They're like, wait a minute.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280]   This is the thing.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280]   This can't be.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.680]   No, no, I think it's mostly used as kind of a you'll log during family holidays.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.880]   It's ever running in the background.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.600]   You know, I have a great new show.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.880]   I want to pitch you.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880]   Yes.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.360]   We can do this every week.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.880]   We could have speed run boxing.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.880]   It'd be great.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880]   I love it.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.880]   Oh, wow.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.520]   Where were we?
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.520]   We were in Ukraine.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.680]   There's still so much more.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.680]   I don't want to kind of belabor it.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.600]   We've certainly been talking about it for the last two weeks.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.040]   I do have a serious question.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:51.160]   I want to ask and really get you guys to weigh in on this because I have really been
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.760]   struggling with this.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:59.960]   So if you look at democracy overall, democracy is really struggling worldwide.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:04.600]   And there was an Atlantic piece that really went into detail about kind of the tools that
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:10.760]   authoritarians are using around the world to kind of, you know, subvert democracy and
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.480]   slowly take it over.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:18.480]   And a real commonality with those tools is they all involve the tech industry to some
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:25.680]   degree, whether it's manufacturing consent or propaganda or mass surveillance or, you
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.680]   know, all these different tricks.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:34.920]   And I wanted to ask you guys, so do you think that I have long been of the opinion that
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.200]   we should have to get to Korea?
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.520]   It's like we should have done this 20 years ago theme here, but we should have had discussions
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:49.840]   about how the things we were built were going to affect the society around us 20 years ago.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:57.080]   And I kind of think what's going on in Ukraine right now is really an ultimate example of
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:03.160]   how the lack of foresight in the tech industry is fundamentally putting democracy at risk.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.400]   It's pretty human.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.800]   I mean, back in 1920, when we were still using electric cars, we might have considered the
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:13.160]   consequence of changing the fossil fuels.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.960]   But you know, I mean, are you willing to give up?
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.960]   That's the much my question.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:22.400]   Like, because you're describing it because stuck with electric cars and they had very
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.600]   short ranges and electricity was expensive or more expensive back then.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.880]   And also that power has to come from somewhere and we would have burned quite cold to generate
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   more power for it.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.360]   So with that, I've held and also the internal combustion engine is an incredibly useful
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.320]   bit of technology that we've gotten a lot of benefits from costs.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320]   Yes.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.200]   And so when Brianna raises her very, very fair point and I think was well said, my fear
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.960]   is that if we began to be more cautious, this risk could be coming overly cautious.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.000]   And I know that I'm taking the capitalist side of this.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.280]   So I'll take the stick for that.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:56.160]   Like one, I don't think we can look far enough to really see two, I don't think society will
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:59.360]   slow down enough in a capitalistic democracy setup, which is the only way that I can kind
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.720]   of think to run things.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.520]   And three, I think you wouldn't be able to kind of figure things out.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.720]   So now it's very easy to do so in hindsight.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:12.320]   I mean, you know, Corey did a great, you know, cause and effect chain of over the past 20
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.560]   years, but that's an all in hindsight.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:21.200]   There's no Harry Selden out there yet who could say, well, I see where this is going.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:29.360]   And even if there were the political will to forego the benefits of the, you know, of
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.760]   fossil fuels or whatever, certainly it's like we don't have the political will to hardly
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:34.760]   anything.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.640]   We know the world is about to be engulfed in flames.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.840]   The latest IPCC report is dire.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.480]   There'll be no action.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.440]   And people are saying we should frock more.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.720]   There'll be literally no response, no, no rational response to that.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.600]   I've, this is why I tried to end the last segment with something positive, like the return
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.320]   of Western liberalism and the greening of America.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.720]   But I guess you guys really want to go down that right.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.880]   The reminocle of despair.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.640]   I think Brianna raises a really excellent point.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:16.280]   And I think that the only way to tackle it is to break it up into different sub questions
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.880]   because like the, should we, should we have thought harder about what we were doing with
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.880]   tech?
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.640]   Obviously the answer is yes, but like which parts and what role does tech play in the
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:32.080]   disintegration of democracy is something that I think you can't just use the unitary phenomenon
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.280]   of tech to analyze that you have to actually break down different functions.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.240]   So like let's say social media, let's say Facebook, is that.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.680]   No, but even with social media.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:41.680]   It's not.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.240]   So I would say that like there are three questions about Facebook and other forms of social media.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.680]   So the first one is what does targeting do?
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.240]   The second one is what about group formation?
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.680]   And the third one is what about persuasion?
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.240]   And persuasion is the one that I think we lean on the most and is the least credible,
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.240]   the least plausible.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.560]   So the tech giants go out there and they say, we have invented a mind control rate to sell
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.680]   your nephew fidget spinners.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.440]   If you pay the premium that we charge for surveillance advertising, we promise that we
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:12.040]   can change people's minds and bypass their critical faculties.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:15.200]   And then there's a certain kind of tech critic who goes, yeah, that mind control is
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.760]   in control rate that they invented to sell your nephew a fidget spinner.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.760]   Guess what?
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.480]   Robert Mercer stole it and made your uncle a QAnon.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.360]   And I don't think that there's much evidence for it.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.000]   You know, I think we see Facebook doing things like they did this experiment where they exposed
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.880]   60 million people to a stimulus they predicted would increase voter turnout.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.760]   They got 300,000 people to vote, which sounds very impressive more than they thought would.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.240]   And it sounds very impressive until you realize that it's a 0.39% effect size and elections
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.080]   are not decided by 0.39% margins.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.920]   But even though that's not a very convincing piece of evidence that Facebook can alter our
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.520]   our conduct, it is in fact very compelling evidence that Facebook is run by the kind of
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:59.920]   donkey that performs non-consensual psychological experiments on 60 million people.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.560]   And they shouldn't be running a goddamn lemonade stand.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:07.040]   So I'm not all that worried about the persuasion part, which leaves this other question, which
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.200]   is if it's not persuasion, if it's not that we're bypassing people's critical faculties,
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:17.160]   how is it that anti-democratic and other odious ideas spread?
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:23.540]   And I think that that is the function of targeting that you can find people who are because
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:27.840]   of their material conditions, predisposed to believe conspiratorial accounts of the
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.840]   world.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.720]   And so I don't think that that's like, that they're like genetic fools.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.240]   I think that it's like, if you've lived in a region that has been heavily destabilized,
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:41.080]   you've experienced serious losses, you're traumatized, you don't trust the institutions that were
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.960]   supposed to protect you because they failed you, then you are in fact disposed to hear
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:52.040]   explanations for what's going on that don't include a necessity that you believe that those
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.600]   institutions are well run when you know for a fact that they aren't.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.880]   And so I think targeting is a thing that you get with advertising.
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:05.000]   And I think that it is a way that all of this stuff has been very salient in our politics.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.960]   And then the final piece is group formation, which is kind of like targeting.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.400]   We are now at this moment where if you have a minority or fringe view, you can find other
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.520]   people who hold that minority or fringe view.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.840]   And in many ways, that's amazing.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:24.760]   We live now in a moment in which things that were illegal and living memory, it's now considered
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:31.520]   a shame and a stain on our moral character that we ever thought that they were wrong,
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:37.500]   like homosexuality or smoking pot or a whole long list of things that we've had a complete
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.260]   reversal of our views.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:43.780]   And the way that we got there was not by people who held heterodox views standing up and demanding
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.140]   to be counted.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:49.640]   It was by people being able to speak their truth quietly to other people who they thought
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:55.460]   would listen and forming groups quietly in private so that they could then stand up
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.420]   and speak their truth together.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:01.560]   And you know, if you're a kid who's never heard the word trans, but you know there's
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.560]   something different about you, you can type some search terms into your favorite search
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.180]   engine and you can find the words for who you are, right?
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:13.140]   And you can acquire the vocabulary and the community to describe it and you can go out
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:14.140]   and do it.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:17.660]   Now, the same thing is true if you believe that Jews secretly run the world, you can
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.860]   also find the words for that and join those people, right?
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:26.480]   And so that has also been incredibly salient to our political fortunes, but in a different
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.420]   way and in a way that I think is more of a mixed bag.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:34.760]   And so I would say like, you know, in terms of like the Mary Keep Kill of these three things,
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.580]   I would kill targeting.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:41.180]   I would basically just make fun of persuasion.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:46.800]   And I would really lean into understanding and refining group formation and trying to
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.800]   figure out ways to put your thumb on the scales for forming groups that are socially beneficial.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.940]   I honestly feel like persuasion is just is just another way of saying targeting and is
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.940]   equal.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:57.940]   It's equally on ineffective.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:00.540]   I'll grant you on the group formation.
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.700]   What about algorithm though?
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.100]   You leave that out.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.100]   It's that's persuasion.
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.320]   Is that part of this question?
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.640]   We spied on you for two years.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:13.080]   We built a profile using all those junk signs that doesn't reproduce like, you know, big
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.080]   fine personality type.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.080]   That's the situation.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.280]   And then we just feed like we feed fidget spinner into it and it pops out the message that makes
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.520]   you want to buy a fidget spinner.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.280]   We feed white nationalism into it.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.200]   That's algorithm in the context of advertising.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.760]   What about algorithm in the context of, I mean, what algorithm is really designed to do is
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:36.780]   increase engagement later on will advertise to you, but we just want you want to be sticky.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:41.680]   But the consequence of unfettered algorithm on a tended algorithm, both on YouTube and
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:47.140]   Facebook seems to be extremism seems to be persuasion in the form of moving.
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:49.500]   I guess there's there's something to that.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:53.600]   But you know, I don't know how you distinguish that from like, I'm really interested in carpentry.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.820]   So I watch a carpentry video and then I discovered that the kind of carpentry I'm interested
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:01.820]   is in joinery.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:03.180]   So I watch one of his suggested joinery videos and pretty soon you're building bonfires.
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:06.260]   Well, it's pretty soon you're like looking at Japanese nailless joinery and then just
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:07.620]   one kind of join.
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:11.420]   And then you've joined an esoteric community of people who just care about this one joint.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:15.300]   Like I don't see how that's very different from any of the other so-called radicalization
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.300]   type.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.300]   That's fairly benign though.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.960]   I mean, but it's the same thing, right?
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.220]   It's all it's doing is it's directing you down an esoteric pathway from a very broad category
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.660]   to the narrower one that you're more interested in.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:29.740]   And I don't know that it's persuading you so much as exposing you.
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:30.740]   Okay.
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.740]   I just don't agree with that.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:33.740]   But go ahead.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:34.740]   Okay.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:35.740]   No, no, no, Brianna, please.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:36.740]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:41.300]   It's well, I was just going to say I think that generally speaking, not talking specifically
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:47.820]   Corey, but I think there's a kind of idealism that has really permeated the tech industry
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:52.340]   where we kind of tell ourselves that these things we build are neutral and that it's
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:56.740]   not having long-term consequences and kind of wash our hands of it.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:59.740]   And I really did used to believe that.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:07.620]   And I just I've really come to believe that we've been information idealists when we need
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:11.420]   to be information realists the whole time.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:17.780]   And I feel like what is going on right now is a really solid example of that.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:23.420]   We talk about like perhaps regulating or tweaking the edges around the algorithm.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:29.140]   I don't know what, you know, what institution is supposed to bring those changes to the
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.140]   forefront.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:36.460]   I think the core thing that's kind of rotten here, if you really want to get down to centrality
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:42.340]   is the culture of the tech industry where we don't have a sense of morality or ownership
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.060]   over the things that we build.
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:50.740]   I do think the engineers, we don't have ethics that we think about the same way that a lawyer
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.900]   or a doctor might tend to think about that.
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:55.540]   It's good in many ways.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:58.940]   You know, you can go out, you can build an app, you can ship it, you don't have to worry
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:25:59.940]   about it.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.540]   And licensing that opens many doors.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:07.620]   I think the dark flip side that we've really kind of just said we don't want to think about
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:15.180]   or hold ourselves accountable with is that there's the things that we have built are increasingly
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:17.060]   really destabilizing the world.
[01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:21.620]   It's certainly destabilizing the democracy here in the United States.
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.420]   And I just, I wish we had thought about this much more.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.420]   It's clear.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.140]   So Twitter is a lot more fun without the Russian troll bots.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:32.420]   You know, I think we're mostly in agreement there.
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:37.100]   You know, I'm all for thinking through ethical precepts when it comes to your, your technological
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.100]   choices.
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:42.300]   What I'm specifically saying though, is if you like me, think that the tech giants are
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:48.140]   corrosive pathological liars, that it would be pretty weird to assume that the only time
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.100]   they're telling the truth is when they claim that their products work really well.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:58.380]   And give it how thin the evidence is for, for that, those products working well, right?
[01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:03.700]   For persuasion, for persuasion working well, P&G dropped its $100 million Google ad spend
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.620]   and saw a zero percent change in their sales.
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.540]   So if that's the case, right?
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:14.180]   If it's just a con, which I think it is, and I think one of the ways in which the tech
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:21.500]   giants are corrosive is that they're con artists, then it is not doing the tech industry's
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:28.340]   job for them to discount the power of algorithmic persuasion.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:32.720]   It in fact is striking at the heart of their business because all of their money comes
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:38.380]   from the faith based belief among advertisers that they can do algorithmic persuasion.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:42.640]   Well, I think it's time to do a little ad before we go.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:46.240]   Okay, go ahead and then I'll do some also algorithmic persuasion coming up.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.280]   I just want to say I don't agree with the Corey and this is why one of the big projects
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:56.760]   we did at rebellion pack over the last year is we went out, we got the voter list and we
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:02.160]   did a project where we wanted to get people to go vote, people that had not voted before
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.000]   in a primary, people that only registered to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.120]   And we went out and we specifically targeted them.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:16.340]   We found out really excellent information on what motivated them to get to the polls.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:22.080]   We showed them pictures of schools in their neighborhood and we really precisely and
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:30.480]   algorithmically tailored what they saw about the issues and serve them ads that were just
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:34.760]   really, really dialed down and created to appeal to them.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:41.000]   I then ran those ads to them with a control group and an experiment group and then I went
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:47.280]   and saw who actually ended up going and voting in the actual election.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.440]   And while I don't know specifically who they voted for, I have actual data.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:58.000]   I can show you this that shows repeating those ads to people over and over objectively made
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.400]   them far more likely to go out and vote.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:05.680]   So I just don't agree with your summation of the data and the studies there.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.760]   And to be fair, I'm not sure I would stipulate that the tech giants are corrosive.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.320]   What did you call them?
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.360]   Or forces for evil or something.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360]   Forces for evil.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.000]   I mean, again, I don't think that we entirely disagree because I think that it's different
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.640]   to find out what people care about and tell it to them versus asking a computer to tailor
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.640]   ads to them.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.360]   And honestly, I think they're just a bunch of guys like you and me.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:35.960]   And maybe they went down the wrong path at one point, but I don't think they're.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:41.320]   They're the same mediocre sociopaths that tried to corner the globe for Commodore and
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.000]   Altavista and Dak.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.600]   The only difference is that we didn't enforce antitrust law for them.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.280]   And we did against all those other companies.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.120]   So they weren't able to corner the market.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.080]   And Microsoft just spent $20 billion buying new ones and it just got approved.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.080]   So cool.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.080]   Oh, no one's went through.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:00.680]   And as the DOJ waved it through, I thought they hadn't.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.280]   I thought I did on Friday.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.080]   Oh, maybe I think you got a little bit of busy day.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.440]   I mean, you need to pay the bills.
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.720]   This is not algorithmic.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.720]   It's not targeted.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:17.080]   I don't want you to take this personally, but I just want to say I'm fat and I have found
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:20.160]   a way to not be so fat.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.920]   I think I think, Brianna, you've been doing something too.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:25.160]   I want to say you look, you look really, really good.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.760]   I lost 80 pounds with this particular.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.760]   80 pounds?
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.680]   I can show you the chart right here.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:35.160]   I put on so much weight when I blew out my knee last year.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.160]   Because you couldn't exercise.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:41.800]   I could exercise at all while I was waiting over COVID to get surgery to actually go do
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   it.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.840]   Hand to God, I lost 80 pounds with this monster.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.160]   I have kept it off now for about five months.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.160]   I've lost about 20.
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.160]   How much have you lost, Lisa?
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.160]   My wife.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.160]   15.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.160]   15.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.920]   But it's not about the pounds.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:59.400]   It's not really about re-educating yourself about why you eat, how you eat.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.800]   Because honestly, no diet is ever going to work long term for you.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:08.480]   Noom, and that's what we're talking about, is really about education.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:14.400]   Now, of course, God, your constant, and I would understand if you go, "Oh, not another
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.160]   diet," we're constantly bombarded by this.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.560]   This is not a diet, right?
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.760]   Lisa's done this.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:20.760]   It's not a diet.
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:21.760]   She swears by it.
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:26.000]   I started doing it because I was doing it to support me as a good wife because you don't
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.600]   need to lose weight like I do.
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:32.480]   Well, with the pandemic and having a lot of fun the first year with cooking and drinking,
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   yes, I could do it.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.480]   We were doing a lot of sourdough.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:38.880]   I need to get back in alignment with where I want to be.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:45.000]   So what happens is that eating is there's a lot of psychology in why you eat.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.200]   It's not always for hunger.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.120]   It's not always for energy.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:55.160]   It is often, and certainly in my case, for emotional satisfaction, I do a lot of what
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.840]   Noom calls fog eating.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:02.160]   So Noom is a psychology-based approach that helps you change the way you think about food,
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.260]   think about health.
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:04.600]   It doesn't say change your lifestyle.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.360]   In fact, the weirdest thing when I first started doing it, I told my coach, "You have
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.360]   a coach.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.360]   You have an app.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.440]   By the way, love the app.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.520]   You have little lessons.
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:17.000]   There's a food log, which is a very important part of it.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000]   You also have a group.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.560]   So there's a lot of support around it.
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:22.160]   But I told my coach, "I had a hot dog last night."
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.520]   And I was so surprised that my coach said, "That's great."
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:25.920]   I said, "Wait a minute.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.120]   That's a bad foodie."
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.120]   She said, "T.I.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.120]   Love you, Tia."
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:32.280]   She said, "There's no bad foods in Noom.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.120]   It's all just food."
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   Right?
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.120]   And that was huge for me.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.440]   Well, that's the best part.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:42.040]   When I joined it with you, the number one thing that hooked me in was I saw a candy maker
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:46.760]   in a commercial say he eats candy every day, and he's maintaining the way he wants.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.120]   And I like my sweets.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.080]   So I went, "Okay, so what's bad for me?
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.180]   Nothing's bad for you.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:52.180]   Everything is moderation.
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:53.180]   It's your personal choice."
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:57.880]   And it's knowing why you're overeating for me.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.880]   See, that's the thing.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:32:59.880]   Everybody's a little different.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.360]   Well, for me, it's like stress eating, ghost eating.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:05.680]   I tend to be less mindful when I'm stressed out.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:08.120]   But for the most part, I'm not aware of it.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:09.720]   I just stuffed my mouth, right?
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.920]   But it's easy and nothing's off limits.
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.600]   So everything is your choice.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.280]   You get to make choices every day.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.800]   And I have been maintaining my weight for a year now.
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.400]   And I've told everyone it's easy.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.120]   I have like 10 friends that have lost weight on NUAM, and they love it.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   And I don't think I'll ever stop just because it keeps me accountable.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:31.920]   NUAM does not believe in restricting what you can or can't eat.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.800]   What NUAM's doing is it's giving you the knowledge and wisdom you need to make informed, underscore
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:40.600]   informed choices that help get you closer to reaching your goals.
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:47.520]   They're using psychological principles like cognitive behavioral therapy so you can better
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.840]   understand your relationship with food, build sustainable habits.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.800]   This is there's ups and downs.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:58.120]   That's why NUAM says it's about progress, not perfection.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.040]   The good news is 75% of NUAM users finish the program.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.760]   Not everybody's going to lose 80 pounds like Brianna did.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.760]   But boy, when it, I mean, it works.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.400]   It really works.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.080]   It's completely grounded in science.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:17.800]   They have published more than 30 peer reviewed scientific articles to inform users and practitioners
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:22.120]   and scientists about what they're doing, how effective it is.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.120]   It's empowering.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.160]   It's not stress inducing.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.560]   It's not guilt.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:26.760]   There's no guilt.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.320]   There's no feeling bad because that just makes you eat more.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.480]   You know that.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.480]   We all know that.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.080]   No fear of ruining your whole program with one off day.
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.480]   NUAM helps you get back on track.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.760]   You decide how NUAM weight fits into your life, not the other way around.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.640]   The readings are quick, 10 minutes a night.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.800]   I got more than you.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.160]   I don't know why, Lisa.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.960]   You'd be done and I'd still be doing my.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.240]   Well, that's because I'm on maintenance.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.160]   So I get like more or more a full day.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.160]   That's why.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.160]   I just love this.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.720]   I love the, I'm about knowledge.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.760]   I love knowing why I'm doing it.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:02.080]   And that helps me eat more healthily.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.680]   And I have really changed my habits.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:06.120]   Start building better habits.
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:07.120]   Sign up for your trial.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.440]   I don't know how else to say it.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.800]   You're bombarded with these, you know, diets and so forth.
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.800]   This is not that.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.360]   This is something very different.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.200]   N-O-O-M, NUAM.com/twit.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.800]   Sign up for your trial at N-O-O-M, NUAM.com/twit.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.440]   We get Lisa to come in because she's my poster girl for this.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.320]   But now I have to say, Brianna, whoa.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.760]   You're a poster child too.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.480]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:36.760]   What I love about this is, you know, I grew up in Mississippi.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.760]   It's not really a place where you have a lot to do.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.760]   French, baby.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:40.760]   Education.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:41.760]   It's not.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760]   It's not.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760]   It's not.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:47.920]   Yeah, I had all these bad habits that I didn't have to think through because I'm pretty active
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.800]   through my 20s and my 30s.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.640]   And, you know, then your 40s come and you're like, "Oh, well, I actually need to think about
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.720]   how what I eat affects my body."
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:57.720]   Yes.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.280]   This was really resetting things.
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:06.740]   And the thing I love the most about this is, I, it's not that it's saying you can't
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:10.880]   eat pizza or chicken wings or things like that.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:17.200]   But once you kind of understand how what you eat affects your body, you crave other
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.200]   things.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:19.200]   That's right.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.200]   That's right.
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.800]   You don't even, it's not like, "Frank ate a pizza at the movie the other day."
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.800]   And I just had no desire to eat that whatsoever.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.640]   It's just, it's building a habit and changing the way the things that you hunger for.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:34.640]   You look great.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.640]   You really do.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.740]   When I knew that it was not bad to eat a hot dog, I ate less hot dogs actually.
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.660]   When you, when you're told, "No hot dogs for you."
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.460]   That's when you crave.
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.140]   I must have hot dogs.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.380]   We went out last night.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:51.380]   Lisa said you could have a hot dog tonight.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.380]   Did I?
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.380]   No.
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:54.380]   No, I didn't have a hot dog.
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:55.380]   Oh, no, no, that's right.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:56.380]   You had chicken parm.
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.380]   Well, it's not.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.380]   It's almost as bad.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:36:59.380]   That's an improvement.
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.380]   It's why we need trouble.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:01.380]   It's why we need trouble.
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.100]   She had garlic fries.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.620]   But we, but we wrote it down, right?
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:05.620]   We put it in our noon.
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.620]   I didn't go over my calories.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.440]   That's all I got to say.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.920]   Anyway, that's a long ad for something that a few of us are pretty excited about.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.480]   Noom.com/twit.
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:16.480]   Thank you, Noom.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.480]   All right.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:21.600]   Speaking of rapacious tech giants who are only out to take our money, Apple's going
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:27.000]   to have a big event on Tuesday.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   I'm already maxed.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.280]   I have an iMac with an M1 chip in it.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:32.080]   And I know they're going to drop a new one with a better chip.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.940]   I'm going to have iMac NV and I hate how they do this.
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:35.940]   Oh, man.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:37.680]   I am sitting here saying take my money.
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:40.880]   I am such a sucker for this.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.560]   If they announce a Mac mini, I'm already, I've got them down for three, I think.
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.560]   Lisa wants one.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.560]   I'm going to get one.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.560]   John, you want one.
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:48.560]   Oh, Micah needs one.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560]   We got four.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.060]   I'm down for four.
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:52.060]   And you want a pro?
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:53.680]   Well, that's coming later in the year.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.200]   We don't know what's going to be announced on Tuesday.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:02.480]   Never says iPhone SE with 5G, a new iPad Air, more pro model.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:05.040]   What everybody will be looking for is other stuff.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:14.000]   And the invitation seems to imply something more than just an iPhone and iPad.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.200]   The tagline is peak performance.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:23.960]   And it's spelled P-E-E-K like you're going to peak at something.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:30.320]   And lately, all of their invitations have had an AR component.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.560]   The AR component looks like you're kind of wandering down.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.680]   There's something around the corner in that Apple.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:41.360]   So I'm starting to think maybe this is where they announce what they have long been rumored
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.720]   to be working on some sort of VR or AR headset.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.720]   Some of the rumors.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.080]   I have to say peak performance sounds like they're launching an only fans competitor.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.000]   No, that's peak performance.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   That's another thing.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000]   Either one.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:03.080]   I'm very excited about this because I was actually at Microsoft's campus when they first let
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:07.720]   people play with HoloLens, which is a project that seemed to be slowly losing steam at Microsoft.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:08.720]   But there's even room I do.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:11.240]   So you're going to cancel the third edition.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:17.400]   Makes me so sad because when I wore those dorky goggles and had my first real AR experience
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.720]   that was good, it was awesome.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.960]   I had such a great time and I was so impressed with it.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.800]   I was like, ah, the future is here.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.800]   Fantastic.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:30.120]   And then all the companies that were doing AR kind of pivoted to industrial uses and then
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.360]   it kind of fizzles out.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.360]   And so if anyone's going to be able to pull this off, I think it's probably going to be
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.360]   Apple.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:39.920]   And so like as a nerd who's been looking forward to AR and VR becoming more mainstream in general
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.760]   for some time, bring it on.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.400]   I'm going to retain 10% optimism here and 90% credit card fear.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:46.400]   I will.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:51.680]   We'll make some bingo cards and we can put AR VR as one of the entries on the.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.160]   On the bingo card, it'll be interesting.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.840]   We're going to live stream it as we always do.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.640]   Michael Sargent and I will do it at 10 AM Pacific on Tuesday.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.160]   That's 1 PM Eastern 1800 UTC.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:07.080]   We do that Mystery Science Theater 3000 kind of thing where Tim will be talking and we'll
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:13.080]   be talking behind him in the background, snarking, having fun, getting excited, bringing out
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.640]   our checkbooks, all of that.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.040]   It's hard not when you're watching these events, not to get sucked into what used to
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.640]   be called the reality distortion field.
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.640]   Can I give you a little bit of a wake up on this?
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.640]   Oh, please.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.640]   Point of view.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640]   Yes.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:33.280]   So this is, this is what really concerns me about this particular technology is not that
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:38.800]   I don't think Apple can do drop dead sexy hardware because I do.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:48.200]   It's, it's that Apple's 3D ecosystem is so limited and my output, myopic compared to
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.240]   the tools, the rest of the industry.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.080]   You're talking about a unity versus say the Unreal Engine.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.280]   I specialize in Unreal.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   Let's take that.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.120]   Unreal is amazing.
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.120]   It's really great.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:05.560]   But Unreal is from Epic and as you know, but they've got some problems there.
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.720]   Epic and Apple just don't mix.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:14.320]   100% on top of that, if you're going to use 3D modeling software, you're using Macs,
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:20.840]   you're using Maya, no one's going to go use, you know, like the freeware versions of it.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.240]   You can use Maya on a Mac, can't you?
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:27.800]   You can, but the problem is it's so poorly maintained.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.840]   It just is not a good experience.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:30.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:37.240]   So, so my point here is we all agree Apple can do the hardware for this.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:45.920]   But as far as getting 3D professionals to bite the bullet and go all in and develop
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.240]   things for Apple, this is a really big lift.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.560]   You're asking them to no swift.
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:56.560]   You're asking them to go through and start learning Apple's like GraphQL APIs, which
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:02.160]   are it's just not a workflow that is the rest of the industry standard workflow.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:08.760]   You're really asking people to move over into Apple's walled garden and ask yourself how
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:14.360]   successful that has been with the games Apple is bringing to market.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.640]   Go look at Apple Arcade.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.720]   They've got some cute stuff there.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:18.720]   It's fun.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.000]   It's a certain floor of quality.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.600]   I'm happy to pay for it every month, but there's nothing there that's going to compete
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.600]   with Elden rings, right, which is built using a more traditional word.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:30.600]   Is it on Unreal?
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.600]   What is it?
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.600]   I don't engine.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.480]   I would guess it's Unreal just looking.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:36.720]   I don't know offhand.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:43.080]   My point here is Apple's walled garden is going to be a barrier to getting widespread
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:48.160]   adoption from the very professionals they need to build content for this.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:56.040]   So that explains something we've been asking a lot, which is why is gaming so laggard on
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.840]   Apple devices?
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:06.000]   It owns casual gaming, but AAA titles like Elden Ring are just not going to appear on
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000]   the Apple platform.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000]   Is that why?
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.720]   There's just no money to be made in translating it over to Apple Silicon.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.400]   Currently, it's just not like people would try it.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.040]   There are a lot of Macs out there, right?
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.800]   If you could make money doing this, I'm sure people would do it.
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:26.520]   As it is, we can barely get Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which came out a long time ago
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:27.520]   at this point.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:35.280]   By the way, Elden Ring runs on their own from software has their own Bloodborne Dark Souls
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:38.000]   Sekiro engine that they use.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.280]   That makes Bandai Nam count published it though.
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.280]   There's a look to it.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.440]   It's a little desaturated.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:47.400]   It feels like the details are very fine.
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.800]   It's a very distinct look.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:55.240]   On the Mac point though with gaming, I have a gaming PC that's medium and I have a recent
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:01.000]   iMac and the old gaming PC can run Crusader Kings 3 with no issues whatsoever.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.280]   On my very new iMac, it is a complete catastrophe.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:08.440]   That's because the systems are not designed to do games and there's not.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.840]   Until Apple decides to take the questions.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.840]   That's the question.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.720]   Is it that the systems are not designed to do games or is it more that developers aren't
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.000]   willing to live in Apple's wall garden?
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000]   Maybe it's both.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.400]   I mean, I'm running Steam on the iMac, which is the same Steam that I run on PC.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.960]   Yeah, but there are very few Steam games.
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:31.120]   I mean, hey, I love Civ 6 as much as the next guy, but there are a few Steam games that
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.120]   run on Mac.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:33.640]   You know what's really interesting?
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.440]   The Steam Deck is starting to come out now.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:39.200]   I know, Corey, you're a big Linux fan as I am.
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.200]   That's Linux.
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.200]   It's Arch Linux.
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.680]   As a result, a lot of developers are now tweaking their games to run on Linux.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:51.760]   Linux is actually beating Macintosh as a gaming platform.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.720]   My brother is so happy, isn't it?
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:57.760]   Well I've been playing Valheim on Linux.
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:03.440]   Linux first, it was written on Linux and then ported to Windows and it runs beautifully.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.360]   It runs great.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.360]   What's Valheim?
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:09.560]   Oh, you don't want to know.
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.960]   It's just a Viking survival game.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:12.880]   I'm a little weird.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.880]   It's just a weird.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.720]   I played Frostpunk, which is just the same thing, but you're against ice instead of Vikings
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:20.000]   and I played that for like a hundred hours.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.160]   You are a Viking in this.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:23.680]   Don't get it wrong.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:26.120]   You are a Viking.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.120]   You've died.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:32.960]   You're Viking Warrior who's died and Odin has brought you back from Valhalla to conquer
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.960]   the evil forces that are taking over this world.
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:41.800]   You've got a big, the big Yggdrasil tree is over you at all times hovering over you.
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:45.720]   Odin appears once in a while to check in on you and mostly you're just building it.
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.440]   But the thing is, it's amazing what you can build in Valheim.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:53.600]   It's kind of like a grown up kind of Minecraft a little bit.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.880]   What about this is strange though because the number one show on Netflix is Vikings
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.880]   Valhalla.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:01.240]   I think you're describing the game as a show.
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.280]   The time is right.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.840]   For me, quarantine was Valheim and Animal Crossing.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:10.400]   It's kind of pathetic.
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:15.080]   The stuff that's got me very interested in Linux hardware on the one hand is the rise
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.120]   of super repairable open frameworks, baby.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.720]   My framework laptop is the best laptop I've ever owned.
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:21.720]   Me too.
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.200]   Now, that's interesting because you were a Lenovo fanazza thinkpad guy.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:28.680]   But thinkpads became impossible to fix.
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.960]   So I'm like way more interested in fixing it than a thing that doesn't break because
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.160]   I can break anything and I do.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:40.680]   So I think pads and I would just hit the keys too hard habitually and wear out my keyswitches
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:43.000]   and have to replace the keyboard.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.160]   For the first 10 years, you'd move to tabs and you'd lift the keyboard out and you put
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:48.880]   the new one and you were done.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:51.400]   And then I got one and I wanted to swap the keyboard and it turned it.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.440]   You had to remove every single component.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.080]   You needed like five special tools.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:58.680]   It was basically you open it up in the back and you moved everything between the back
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:46:59.680]   and the keyboard.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:02.600]   Then you took the keyboard out and then you rebuilt the laptop.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.560]   So this framework, I got the first batch.
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.680]   So it had a couple of like hardware glitches.
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:09.360]   So I had to replace the hinges.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:18.200]   And I did it after the day after my hip replacement only sitting up 45 degrees, stoned out of
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.880]   my gourd on on on OXES.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.800]   And it took me 11 minutes.
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:25.840]   He can replace his keyboard.
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:26.840]   Stoned on OXE.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.600]   It was I mean it is remarkable.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:32.640]   So on the one hand, I'm really interested in those things.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.800]   And on the other hand, I'm just interested in all the like raspberry pie and like micro
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:44.440]   controller based tiny, weird 3D printed one off like cyberspace decks and palm tops and
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:47.920]   just these these homemade computers.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:54.400]   There's one if you Google like chunky palm top CHONK palm top and you'll get a GitLab
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:56.560]   site for Daniel Norris.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:59.520]   It's I think it's that the coolest looking computer.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.920]   I don't know if I could ever use it, but it is the coolest looking computer I've seen
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.400]   since you know forever.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.080]   I'm looking at the keyboard is a little chunky.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.080]   Did it get melted?
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.080]   Was it micro?
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.440]   It's a chunky palm top.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:14.080]   That is that is a palm top that is very chunky.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.080]   You know what I just got and I'm kind of excited.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:20.200]   I got a pine phone pro, which is a Linux phone.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:24.760]   As you know, Corey running the manjaro with KDE and I bought the keyboard for it.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:32.840]   And now I it is now a clam shell, tiny little clam shell computer with LTE.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.600]   It's very intriguing to me.
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:38.640]   Yeah I agree with you 100%.
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:45.240]   What was you know, industry dominated by beige boxes and you know if you were a little weird
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:49.840]   a Mac has now really exploded into so many different and interesting things.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:52.960]   A guy called me yesterday on the radio show.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:59.120]   He wanted to do a smart frame and he said you know I have this windows nook that I could
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.320]   use with a monitor.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:04.040]   But the only software out there I have to pay a subscription for.
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:08.680]   He said what are you trying to use a windows PC for this get a right buy.
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.880]   There's a hundred different ways to do a smart mirror or a smart frame for free.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:17.200]   And I just I love that these are all custom builds one offs.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:19.360]   I had a friend over for dinner and drinks last night.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.040]   I got a couple Tom Jennings who created a thing called Fido.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:23.480]   I know Tom very well.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:24.480]   I was a fighter.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:26.400]   I was up in 94.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.240]   You know, absolutely lovely fella and one of his long running hobbies.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:31.240]   He's rebuilding.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:34.640]   Oh yeah, rebuilding Nash Ramblers.
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:38.600]   And he has just like customized Nash Ramblers in so many different ways.
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.780]   And he's got one that he built a high performance Nash Rambler hot rod that's got like two micro
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:46.400]   controllers in it to control the fuel injection.
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:49.960]   And he's just you know, the one he showed up with last night had like a Mobius paint
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.360]   job down the side and a rebuilt engine.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.600]   And I just love this this, you know, maybe it's the Walter Benjamin and me, but you know,
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:05.320]   these these one off hand built idiosyncratic, you know, there are no two alike kind of gadgets.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.280]   And the thing, the fact that you can get a thing that looks like the chunky palm top
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:12.280]   that has the fit and finish of a thing that looks like it came off an injection molding
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:18.480]   line, but is actually just a thing one person made and there's only one of them is really
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.480]   cool.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:26.360]   Give me I am thrilled to hear that Thomas around and active is what is he besides doing
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:29.360]   Ramblers is like semi retired.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.360]   Nice.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.160]   No, he and his boyfriend have a dog.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:33.160]   The dog is old.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.160]   They're having a nice time.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.840]   He's you know, he's roughly my age.
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:38.120]   So he's an old timer.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.120]   But Tom.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:44.480]   So this kids there was before the internet, there was this thing called BBS's bulletin
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:46.240]   board systems.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.480]   And the and the best you wouldn't even remember this Alex the best.
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:50.800]   Oh, no, this is before my time.
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:56.160]   No way before the best of them was Fido Fido net.
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:01.600]   I ran a Fido BBS with not one, but two phone lines in the in the mid eighties.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:09.160]   And in fact, we were doing an early version of a global messaging system called echo net
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:13.120]   on top of Fido net where it was kind of a store and forward mail system.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.040]   And it was really interesting, exciting times.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.040]   I like that.
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.040]   I like that.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:23.320]   That kind of yeah, and Fido nets Fido nets, you know, it's killer app was that each Fido
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:27.120]   net BBS would call other ones that were nearby and exchange messages with them.
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:28.120]   That was echo.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:33.400]   Yeah, when the when the long distance rates were lowest and so on and build it out.
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:38.540]   And you know, the I met Tom at a conference that my friend John Gilmore helped start
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:44.600]   EFF was at and John started the first BBS are first inter ISP rather is then called
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:46.280]   the little garden in San Francisco.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:53.560]   I remember and and his CTO is a guy called Tim Posar and Tim and John and yeah, and Tim
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:52:00.600]   and John and and and you know, we're reminiscing about Fido net with with Tom and about the
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:05.560]   day that they bridge Fido net into usen at and like they wrote a little software to bridge
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:10.120]   the two in and I remember because I was on a Fido net bulletin board in Toronto as you
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.960]   know, a callow youth with an amigo 1000.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:18.480]   And I remember the day that the internet arrived on my local BBS right this suddenly use net
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:24.320]   had been imported whole as bolus into my local BBS and then listening to these three dudes
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:27.760]   just talk about like writing the code to do it.
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:32.200]   It was really amazing was like it was like eavesdropping on, you know, God and his angels
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:35.120]   describing how they hung the stars in the firmament or something.
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:38.080]   It was really wild.
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:41.400]   Tim was the chief engineer of the radio station I was working at.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.880]   He introduced me to Tom and the rest is history and wow.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:49.240]   So there's a there's a full circle.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:53.280]   Can I just throw in one thing here because I'm a little bit younger and so my first internet
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:56.160]   experience was dial up on Windows 95 more or less.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.800]   Maybe it's 98.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:59.880]   I feel like I missed something very interesting.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:03.360]   Just listen to you guys talk this through and with when the technology world was was
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:08.960]   seems to be smaller and more like nascent, you know, yes, more obvious.
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:15.360]   Yeah, do it yourself kind of now now that the kids are doing NFTs and it doesn't seem
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.000]   you had the same ethos to it.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.480]   Tom has this incredible story.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:24.080]   He tells about these arguments that used to happen on fighter net all the time and the
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:27.520]   way that the shape of the argument was that someone would say, how dare you come into
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:30.160]   my living room and talk to me that way.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:33.920]   And he would have to cool people out like it was before Bill Gibson coined the term cyber
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.120]   space, right?
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:39.160]   And he would just have to explain that like, although the conversation is happening in
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:43.880]   your living room for you, the person who's having that conversation with you is not in
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:45.120]   your living room.
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:47.520]   Like you just need to think read back to norms.
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:53.000]   You need to rethink your normative framework for this discussion that we're having.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.680]   I'm just looking through somebody has published.
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:58.600]   I guess is I guess there's still Fido locations around.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:03.120]   This is the Fido net node list, which is great.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.320]   Oh, my God.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:10.840]   These are these most of these units are down, but the some surprising number are still around.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:15.200]   When the apocalypse comes, this is going to be the internet, by the way.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.600]   That's going to be won't be left.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.800]   Those might be the last landline still in use.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.720]   I'm sure somebody has created a back end effect.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:31.480]   It looks like there is a back end of the internet so that sure, some of these don't have phone
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.480]   number.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:35.040]   A lot of these don't have phone numbers, but some do.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.040]   Some do.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:40.400]   I've often thought about creating a video game that would be 80s hacker.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:43.240]   It would bring back those haze commands.
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:44.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:49.400]   Like the way you had the sign on the bulletin boards and download things like that.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:55.880]   I was waxing nostalgic about my early coding days back when I had fight on it.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:58.120]   It was so hard to get in with only two phone lines.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:04.000]   I wrote a demon dialer for the Macintosh because it was a Macintosh board, MacQ8586
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.440]   early days of Mac.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:11.720]   I wrote a demon dialer and I'm still convinced it was the first multitasking program ever
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:12.720]   written for the Mac.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:17.040]   I use the vertical blank interval when the electron gun goes from the bottom to the top
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:18.320]   of the screen to start darring.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.120]   Again, there's a brief few milliseconds that the computer can't do anything that you can
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:28.640]   grab and say stuff the ATD command into the modem.
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.440]   One character at a time.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:33.960]   So it's stuff the command and it's stuff the phone number in and then it would stuff the
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:38.480]   dial command and then every vertical blank, 60 times a second, would check to see if it
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:42.800]   was a busy signal or if it was ringing and there was a haze command for I got through
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:49.040]   and then it would make a big, when it got through, it was called Q dial.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.040]   It was purpose built.
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.320]   It would only dial my BBS.
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.920]   But what's a haze command?
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:55.920]   Never mind.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:56.920]   Forget you don't.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.200]   Oh, so let's talk about the framework laptop.
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:59.200]   This poor kid here.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:00.360]   He never heard of it.
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:01.360]   Guys, I'm 32.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:03.200]   I know that I'm the only person on the show.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:05.080]   But I'm not exactly 17.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:06.080]   I'm not cool either.
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.360]   And I'm just saying like, this stuff sounds awesome.
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:09.440]   I'm not even trying to be a pejorative.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.440]   Like, no, no, no, no.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.440]   I'm curious about what I miss.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.680]   He stands where it's a great story, right?
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:14.680]   It was a proprietary.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:19.800]   It was a proprietary command set to control modems that then became de facto standard and
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.560]   there was, you know, there was saber rattling, stop making modems that are compatible with
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:24.960]   my command set and so on.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:29.080]   It was one of those early fights that looks a lot like some of the fights we've had since
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:30.880]   about about weather.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:36.760]   Like, I mean, I think if you follow the Oracle API lawsuit, you know, the haze command
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.360]   set story would would seem pretty familiar to you.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.360]   No kidding.
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:41.520]   What goes around comes around.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:42.680]   You're not that old though, Corey.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:44.320]   I'm surprised you remember all this.
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:47.480]   I'm 51 almost 50 and a half.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.600]   You must have been a mere child.
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:54.760]   But so my dad was a computer scientist who brought home a teletype in 1977 with an acoustic
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:55.760]   coupler.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:56.760]   There you go.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:57.800]   And so yeah, that was my first.
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:03.680]   My first dial up was PDPs and it was basic interpreters, Eliza and a app program with
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.000]   the seven other people who could dial into that mean frame.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.800]   Do you ever play colossal cave?
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:08.800]   Sure.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:11.800]   I spent hours.
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:12.800]   I did all the nostalgic computing.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:15.000]   You have to put the handset in the rubber.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000]   Suckin cup.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.080]   And then if anybody picks up the phone while you're in the colossal cave, mom, get off
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:23.080]   the phone.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:24.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:25.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.080]   I used a couple or sounds like science fiction.
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:28.000]   Are you telling me this is actually backwards?
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000]   I got you.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000]   That's awesome.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000]   You had to.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.200]   So you know how when you get on your modem, it goes, Eric.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.040]   And then it goes, then it turns off because you don't want to hear that actually is analog
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:44.440]   sound that can be translated into ones and zeros.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:47.800]   That's how phone lines send data.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.120]   And acoustic coupler worked with your standard telephone.
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:52.400]   Here's one.
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:54.680]   And you had a mic and a speaker.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.440]   And you just hung the phone up in it.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:58.440]   So this is a modem.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.440]   That's the most you've ever seen.
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:05.080]   It would turn the sound into and would set it down the phone line as sound.
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.600]   So if you listen, that's what you'd hear.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.520]   I'm in awe of how cool this is.
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:12.200]   That's like so that feels very DIY hackarish.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:16.320]   Like in that cool and then that was the only thing I expect them.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:18.680]   That's all it was for me.
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:24.120]   I'm a little, I'm a little younger than Leo and Corey, but you know, I saw war games
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:28.520]   and I'm like, I want to know how to do all of this.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.400]   I had to learn that instantly.
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.800]   So I got my parents to go get me acoustic couplers were out by that time.
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:37.960]   It was like a 24 hundred bottom.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:43.280]   So you can plug in, but like writing a program to go through and like auto dial BBS.
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:45.680]   And there was no security back then.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:46.680]   None.
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:49.360]   If you just hit the jackpot, it would be something.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:51.440]   Oh, I had all sorts of stuff on there, man.
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:52.440]   I was going.
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:55.360]   So I'm going to pull a Corey here.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:59.760]   This goes back to the card or phone decision because I was just going to say this is Carter
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:00.760]   phone.
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:03.480]   You and I are on the same wavelength here.
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:04.480]   I'll bite.
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:05.480]   What's that?
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:07.440]   I'll let Corey explain.
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:12.160]   So in the old days, so this is actually really relevant to the discussions we have about things
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:15.400]   like Facebook today about whether we should like break them up or just try and make them
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:16.840]   behave themselves.
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:22.800]   So for 68 years, the FTC and the DOJ tried to break up AT&T and AT&T kept getting these
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:28.000]   new leases on life by offering to try and solve the problems they created.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.400]   So they would like do universal service to make up for all the coops and small businesses
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:35.080]   that they put at a business with predatory conduct.
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:40.600]   And one of the things that would happen is every time they would become more central
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:46.840]   to safety and security is they would get more power to control their competitors.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:51.520]   And one of the things they got was the right to decide who could plug things into the bell
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.520]   system.
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:57.120]   So the first layer of this was they had the right to control mechanical coupling to the
[01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:58.320]   bell system.
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:02.200]   And they went after a company that sold, it was called HashaPhone and they sold these
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:04.720]   cups that went over the receiver of your phone.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.600]   So they took a talk into them like this.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:09.440]   And people couldn't read your lips or hear you.
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:13.160]   And they argued that by making a plastic cup that fit over your phone, you were endangering
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:14.160]   the bell system.
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:19.080]   And thus America's public safety and security apparatus, they lost that case, but they retained
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:24.080]   the right to control electric coupling to the system until Carter phone came along.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.720]   And Carter phone was a gadget for ranch hands.
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:30.160]   And what it would let you do is plug a walkie talkie into your phone with an acoustic
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:34.880]   coupler and when your phone rang, it would transmit it to a walkie talkie on your belt
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:37.440]   when you were out in the barn or out on the range.
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:43.160]   And they argued that the electric coupling of the, because there was a way to detect
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:48.160]   that it was ringing and take it off hook, that the electric coupling was itself another
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:49.800]   danger to the system.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:55.840]   And once again, the courts told them to go to buzz off and that opened the door for modems,
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:01.240]   answering machines, PBXs, just like all kinds of things that we plug in, the sports, sports
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:05.440]   illustrated, complimentary football shaped phone, all of those things.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:11.040]   Because prior to that, their subsidiary Western Digital was the only company able to make phones.
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:15.720]   And they were able to do all kinds of really abusive things like you couldn't buy a phone.
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:16.920]   You could only lease it.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:21.480]   And then over the course of your lease, you might pay for that phone a hundred times.
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:28.600]   And as late as the 2010, there were still customers like old people who were still leasing a
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:33.880]   Western Digital phone that they'd had for 60 years and paying like $10 a month to lease
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:39.240]   a phone whose retail value at that point was less than $1.
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.160]   And they were still making money on this.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:46.280]   So yeah, it was, Carter from his turning point that ended all kinds of predatory scams that
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:51.440]   were endemic to having a regulated monopoly instead of breaking it up and making it week
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:54.120]   or so that other firms can compete with it.
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.320]   It was actually broken.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:57.240]   There's been 84, I think.
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:58.240]   82.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:01:59.240]   82.
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:00.720]   Right before I set up that BBS.
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:01.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:02.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:05.440]   Well, I mean, that's where there's no, wouldn't been able to do a BBS without it.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.440]   Well, yeah.
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:10.560]   So, Fido net wouldn't have existed if they hadn't broken up the bells and made them have
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:11.560]   long distance competition.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:12.560]   Yep.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.560]   Right.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.040]   Because there's long distance competition that made Fido net possible.
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.120]   Here's something none of you remember.
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:19.040]   Maybe you will, Corey, you might be old enough.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.400]   You get on a long distance call and you go, I got it.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.400]   I got to make this quick.
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:24.760]   It's cost a lot of money.
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:25.760]   100%.
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.080]   Nowadays, you can call around the world for nothing.
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:31.080]   Nothing.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:32.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:36.560]   There's no historical parallels whatsoever to Carter phone and closed app ecosystems at
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:37.560]   all.
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:38.560]   It sounds like between.
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:39.560]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:40.720]   Google versus Oracle goes right straight.
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:45.240]   So essentially, yeah, welcome to sweat where time is a flat circle and we go round and round.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:47.240]   Meanwhile, back to the framework laptop.
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:48.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:50.400]   Actually, let's take a break and then we'll get back to the frame.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:51.400]   Okay.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:56.920]   I want to give them a big fat plug because we really want this to continue on.
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:00.080]   It's more than just people on Oxy trying to change their keyboards.
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:01.080]   Really?
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.520]   That's a lot of stuff.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.400]   But this is some hinges hinges hinges hinges hinges.
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:06.400]   That's right.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:10.960]   Actually, I was the second batch and I have had zero problems.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:18.040]   I've been hoping to have a problem just so I can get stoned on Oxy, but I the nothing.
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:21.680]   This is something you're going to know about Alex because in fact, you told me you know
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:23.720]   these guys podium, right?
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:28.320]   Yeah, this is how another way the world has changed.
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.400]   And then finally it fits into my introvert lifestyle.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:33.320]   I hate calling people.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.520]   I hate calling for dinner reservations.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:36.520]   I hate.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:38.720]   I don't want to call anybody anytime.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:41.800]   If I can text message, I'm a happy camper.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:45.040]   Well, it turns out, I guess I'm not alone.
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:50.720]   Text messaging is and maybe it's because of COVID all of a sudden the way to communicate
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:54.640]   from a business to a customer.
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:59.360]   And that's what podium is all about the ultimate text messaging platform.
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.200]   You know, the open rate on text messages is well over 90%.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.000]   It's the best way to get to a customer.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.120]   What can you do?
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:10.680]   You can say, Hey, how did you like that hot dog?
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:12.720]   Leave a review on Yelp.
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:13.720]   Text them a message.
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:17.800]   The link, the chances are you're going to get that review.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:21.960]   You want to, I get a text message every other week from the local ice cream shop.
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:23.320]   It says, I haven't seen you in a while.
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:24.800]   Here's a 30% off coupon.
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.960]   It really works.
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:29.280]   You can use podium to collect payments.
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:34.520]   You can use them for a whole variety of interactions.
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.720]   Imagine I use it the other day.
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:37.720]   I needed it.
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:39.360]   I had a window broken.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.960]   I looked up a bunch of different glaziers.
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:45.280]   That's the name of somebody who fixes your windows.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:47.400]   I texted them.
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:48.880]   First one to respond.
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:52.280]   First one to get the job using podium with podium.
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:56.760]   It closed deals with customers before the competition even has a chance to call them
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:57.760]   back.
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.920]   And you're going to love it.
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:02.560]   Your staff is going to love it because it all goes, however they contact you, you can
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.240]   put podium on your website.
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:05.520]   You can do it in any way.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:08.040]   However they contact you, it goes into one inbox.
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:10.360]   It's easy for you to respond.
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:14.280]   You don't have enough hours in the day to play phone tag with your customers.
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:18.080]   And frankly, this is what your customers want.
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:23.600]   That's why so many businesses, more than 100,000 businesses, streamline their customer interactions
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:24.680]   with podium.

[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:41.520]   Brandon Sanderson.
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:42.520]   Oh, ah.
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:47.520]   I knew you were going to do that.
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:48.520]   Yeah.
[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:49.520]   Corey, I don't know.
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:50.520]   Do you feel jealous?
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:53.520]   You know, I was really following your footsteps.
[02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:54.520]   Yeah.
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.360]   Well, he had done another one.
[02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:59.720]   He did this with a limited edition hardcover before.
[02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:03.640]   He's done a series of these limited edition hard covers that did extremely well over a
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.080]   million dollars.
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:08.400]   And then he then he decided to do a fully self published book.
[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:09.400]   I think it's great.
[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:14.520]   I think he's doing amazing stuff and showing how we can get around it, around the choke
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:17.320]   points in the system.
[02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:20.280]   I'm really glad to see him doing it.
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:21.280]   You know, I--
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:28.520]   It sure beats a $50,000 upfront and 5% of the net.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:29.520]   Sure.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:30.640]   I mean, I hope he does.
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:33.840]   I hope he-- and I'm sure he is thinking on these lines.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:37.320]   I hope he does the kinds of things that George Martin did, which is roll a bunch of money
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:38.400]   into arts funding.
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.400]   Yeah.
[02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:42.960]   And to, you know, platform building and so on that, that, you know, whether that's like
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:47.080]   Meowle for the Cocktail Theater or the other things that George has done, where, you know,
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:49.720]   you take some of that money and you turn it into a lasting legacy.
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:50.720]   I didn't know that.
[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:51.720]   Good for him.
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:52.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:53.720]   Good for him.
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:54.720]   Yeah.
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:57.120]   George has done amazing things with his HBO money.
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:59.720]   Well, I'll stop yelling at him to finish the series.
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:00.720]   Yeah.
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:01.720]   So you can finish that book.
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:04.360]   I've been waiting for a long time now.
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:05.360]   I would like to read it.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:08.040]   I think I have to go back and read all of them again.
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:09.040]   It's been so long.
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:10.040]   Yeah, you forget.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:11.040]   Yeah, you guys start over.
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:12.960]   All the swords was so long.
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:13.960]   So I started on.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:14.960]   What were you trying to say?
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:18.480]   No, no, I was just going to say I'm really torn on this one.
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:23.520]   You know, I knew Brandon before he really, you know, got the Wheel of Time series and
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.280]   really kind of went to the next plane.
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:26.280]   He got to finish.
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:27.280]   He got to finish.
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.280]   Yeah.
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:33.480]   Robert Jordan's began the 15 volume series and passed away before he finished it.
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:35.680]   Brandon Sanderson was nominated to finish it.
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:37.680]   And I think did a very good job by the way.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.680]   Yeah, he did.
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:43.360]   He's a really nice person in real life.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:47.800]   I could not say a single bad sentence about him.
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:54.760]   I do think it's worth pausing and thinking about what the consequences of this are for
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:56.240]   the rest of the industry.
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:57.840]   And we have authors here.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:02.440]   So I don't want to like explain how the book industry works, but for the audience, you
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:07.760]   know, you have really big names that sell a ton of books, right?
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:09.400]   You've got the Stephen Kings.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.880]   You've got the James S.A.
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:11.880]   Corries.
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:17.840]   They are the 10 poll people that put out a product and you know it's going to make enough
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:24.800]   money that the publishers and the editors and all the other people that work in book publishing
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:31.600]   are able to, you know, make more bets on smaller books, most of which are going to fail to
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:34.640]   make any money whatsoever.
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:41.000]   And at the core, what you have here is one of the most independent names here.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.840]   One of the most successful names here that say, you know what, I'm going to get around
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:47.800]   the whole publishing industry part of this here.
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.080]   I'm going to, you know, I'm going to print the books myself.
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:53.160]   I'm going to pay for the warehouse.
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:55.080]   I'm going to ship it myself.
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:59.360]   And I'm just going to eat the entire, you know, I'm going to vertically integrate the
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:03.240]   entire process and get this out and keep more of the money.
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:09.600]   Yeah, the truth is that the Brandon Sanderson's of the world are able to negotiate a much
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:18.440]   better deal than someone who may not have a successful track record in publishing already.
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:25.720]   And I just worry that in a future where everyone does this, what does this mean for the entire
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:27.840]   publishing industry overall?
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:30.120]   I think it would be very bad for it.
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:36.000]   So, you know, where we like authors on Facebook that are just really bitter towards Brandon,
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.440]   it comes across as sour grapes.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:44.280]   He's a fantastic author that delivers for his audience and deserves all the success in
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:45.280]   the world.
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:50.640]   I just think it's worth saying that the people that work in publishing, which are overwhelmingly
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:57.240]   women, this is an industry that Amazon has been wildly successful at stripping the profits
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:58.240]   from it.
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:04.080]   More and more people are working for lower wages and, you know, the advances for starting
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:06.240]   authors are getting lower and lower.
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:08.480]   And I think this trend is going to accelerate that.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:10.480]   I'm going to get Corey's comment on this.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.720]   But before we do, I should explain because I don't think we've explained Brandon Sanderson
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:22.080]   during COVID was busy scribbling away and wrote four novels in the last two years, went to
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:30.840]   Kickstarter, started a Kickstarter to buy copies of these books and various swag boxes,
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:33.600]   planned to get a million dollars over 30 days.
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.840]   Within a day, he had 15 million.
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.440]   He's up to 24.8 million and 24 days to go.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:45.720]   And of course, except for the cut, the Kickstarter takes, that all goes into his pocket.
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:48.000]   So that's a minus is production costs.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.200]   And what he'd ever cost to print the book and so forth.
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:53.240]   So it's a pretty interesting thing.
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:58.120]   But what about Brianna's contention that that undermines that if these tent poles pull
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:00.400]   out the whole thing, collapse these scores?
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:05.280]   I mean, I think that there's it's definitely the case that large publishers benefit from
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:10.080]   having these winner take all authors under their, under their wing.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:15.040]   But you know, as an author, I think the thing that presents the largest risk to negotiating
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:21.560]   leverage and our ability to do well is is not whether or not large publishers have access
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:23.360]   to tent pole books.
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:27.080]   It's concentration in the industry overall and up and down the supply chain.
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.400]   So there's one distributor left, right?
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:31.080]   They bought out their major rivals.
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:32.360]   So it's just Ingram.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.800]   There's one major online bookstore.
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:38.200]   There's one major national brick and mortar chain.
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:41.640]   There are only four major publishers left.
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:45.600]   And then in other parts of the sector, for example, in screenwriting, there's four major
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:50.000]   super agencies that all decided that they were going to start taking big chunks out of
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:54.600]   their writers and using something called packaging fees that sparked a four year writer strike
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:58.320]   that just just ended successfully with for the writers.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:01.360]   And I think it's that lack of competition that means that you just can't shop around.
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:06.720]   I mean, definitionally, when you have a buyer's market, right, when there are more sellers
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:11.240]   than buyers, buyers don't have to work as hard to attract the sellers and acquire what
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:12.240]   they want.
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:15.120]   And it's true that those tent pole authors can write their own ticket.
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:18.360]   And it's always been the case that those tent pole authors can write their own ticket.
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:21.480]   I mean, nominally, all writers get the same royalty rights.
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:24.720]   They are standardized across the industry and across publishers.
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:30.760]   But the reality is that big name writers will often get paid an advance that is impossible
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:31.760]   to earn out.
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:34.880]   So they're being paid in advance against the royalties they'll eventually earn.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.000]   But the publisher understands that they will never earn out that advance.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.320]   What they're effectively doing is a backdoor, higher royalty rate for those for those writers.
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:47.920]   So it's always been the case that those big writers have had extra negotiating leverage.
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:52.720]   But for little writers, I think the thing that that gives the most negotiating leverage
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:55.600]   is just having more places to sell your books.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.480]   And you know, there is some empirical basis for this.
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:02.200]   So my co-author on this book, choke point capitalism that Beacons publishing in September
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:05.880]   is a great Australian scholar called Rebecca Gibleen, she's a copyright scholar.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:10.200]   And she worked with the Australian author's society to do the largest ever empirical analysis
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:16.200]   of publishing contracts, where she got anonymized publishing contracts for some really large
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:21.480]   appreciable fraction of all the books published in Australia in kind of modern history and
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:26.400]   was able to use those as a data set to really empirically trace the change in authors'
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:31.720]   advances and in the royalties paid out and things like how many other rights you have
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:35.160]   to sell to sell your books or whether you get to keep your audio rights and sell them
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.920]   separately or what have you.
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:43.080]   And she found that the strongest correlate of declining fortunes for authors is market
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:47.120]   concentration, not the profitability of the firms.
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:52.680]   In fact, the profitability of the firms moves inversely to author compensation because as
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:57.960]   the firms become more concentrated, they become more profitable and they pay lower advances.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:03.160]   So I don't think that simply making the firms more profitable gets authors a better deal.
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.240]   If we're going to get authors a larger share of that money, the firms have to be competing
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:08.440]   for the authors.
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:12.680]   Well, that's really the case, not just in publishing, but across the board.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:13.480]   Absolutely.
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:15.800]   There's Starbucks or anybody else.
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:19.000]   You say, well, if these guys could make more money, we could pay better.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.120]   It seems to be quite the opposite, as a matter of fact.
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:26.920]   The word you're looking for here is monopsony, which is when there's concentration in sellers
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:27.960]   rather than buyers.
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:28.960]   That's right.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:31.880]   And doctrine for 40 years has been that we don't have to worry about monopsony.
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:33.960]   We just have to worry about monopoly.
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.960]   And monopsony effects are much more sharply felt.
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:41.320]   The models show that when there's a buyer that accounts for as low as 10% of a single
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:45.680]   sector that they can start distorting the whole structure of the sector.
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:50.840]   And so when you think about Amazon with 40% to 50% of trade book sales and 90% of audiobook
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:54.920]   sales through Audible, they really are able to squeeze everyone.
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:59.240]   I mean, Audible's embroiled in this Audible Gate scandal now where the independent authors
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:04.200]   that had signed up for Audible, and in many cases were locked into not selling anywhere
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:09.000]   but Audible now because one of them is a forensic accountant and got sent some real
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.160]   royalty statements by accident and not the fake ones that they've been sent, they reckon
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:17.720]   that more than $100 million has been stolen from independent authors that way.
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:18.720]   Stolen.
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:20.240]   It's just in wage theft.
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:21.480]   Pure wage theft.
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.640]   Just just miss accounting for royalties.
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:24.640]   Wow.
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:26.120]   Because you have to take their word for it.
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:27.120]   That's right.
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:29.120]   And I think it was trending on Twitter.
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:30.120]   Audible Gate.com.
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:34.240]   They actually, I guess they've got a class action that they're starting up.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:38.160]   I actually want them shocked that Amazon was behaving poorly.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:41.840]   Well, and abusing its workforce and suppliers, right?
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:48.320]   I mean, that is Amazon's promise has always been we will give you lower costs and please
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:53.440]   just don't look very closely at how we're achieving that cost basis because it's by
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:57.680]   immiserating the people in our supply chain, whether they're warehouse workers or drivers,
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:01.360]   peeing in bottles or authors who are having their royalties stolen.
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:02.880]   Corey's books are not unaudible.
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:04.920]   They're on what, Libro.fm, right?
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:05.920]   Sure.
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:06.920]   Yeah.
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:09.920]   And on downpour and Google Play, basically anywhere that doesn't require you to have
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:14.960]   DRM because the other thing about Audible is that they will only sell with DRM even if
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:16.520]   the author doesn't want it.
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:20.520]   And then they won't allow, even if the author authorizes it, they won't allow their customers
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:22.120]   to remove the DRM.
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:24.800]   So once you buy Audible, you're stuck with Audible forever.
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:31.040]   It's a bit like the BBC hoping that you will have a separate BBC app for all your podcasts.
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:35.680]   Audible has achieved a situation in which if you want to listen to audio books from someone
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:37.880]   else, you have to have a second app.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:42.560]   You can't just take your audio books and put them in another app the way that you could.
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:47.040]   It'd be like if you had to have both pages and Word on your Mac in order to read Word
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:48.600]   files, you know?
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:53.680]   And the show point capitalism comes out this fall, Rebecca Gibley and Corey Doctorow.
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:55.920]   Now you're publishing this with Penguin Random House.
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:58.520]   Have you done, you've done self publishing too though, right?
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:16:59.520]   I have.
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:00.520]   Yeah.
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:02.960]   So that's actually it's from Beacon, but Penguin Random House Distributes said, Oh, okay.
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.120]   I've self published.
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:10.200]   I've published with, I think now all of the big four and Macmillan is my main publisher.
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:14.200]   And I've done with a bunch of small presses, including some great ones like McSweeney's,
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:15.960]   which is the one that Dave Eggers started.
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:16.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:17.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:21.640]   I've got a lot of experience up and down the board, you know, more than 20 books.
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:28.080]   And you know, I really think that the hardest thing for an author right now, and this is
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:31.760]   something my agent says every time I talk to him, is there's just not that many places
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:33.200]   to sell your books.
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:37.080]   And so if you don't like the terms that are being offered by your publisher, chances are
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:40.120]   they're the same as the other three publishers, the other three major publishers.
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:44.120]   But if they're not, and the other, the other publisher has slightly different terms won't
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:45.920]   take your book is an interest.
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:47.440]   You're out of options.
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:52.080]   And you know, there's a bit of solidarity opportunity here because if you're an editor,
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:55.280]   and you don't like your working conditions, there's only three other employers for you
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:56.280]   too.
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:01.820]   And so, you know, there's, there's a degree of solidarity here between writers and editors.
[02:18:01.820 --> 02:18:05.040]   What do you get from using a publisher that you don't get self publishing?
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:08.160]   Is there something it used to be they'd get you in bookstores?
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:10.120]   I don't think that matters anymore.
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:11.320]   I think that matters a lot.
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:12.320]   There's a lot of hands selling.
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:13.320]   Okay.
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:14.320]   Yeah.
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:16.960]   And then the publicity and PR and just the best use of my time.
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:22.600]   So I did a short story collection called with a little help that Frank did the cover for
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:24.200]   that did pretty well.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:28.280]   I mean, short story collections are not going commercial concerns.
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:33.240]   The most short story collections draw advances of, you know, a couple thousand dollars and
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:35.040]   sell a couple thousand copies.
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:36.720]   They're not, they're not a big deal.
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:37.880]   It's not a major money maker.
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:42.360]   Although it's a thing I quite love and buy a lot of and read a lot of.
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:48.120]   And so with this one, I made about $30,000, but it took me as much time as I would have
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:51.680]   spent writing a novel that would have made me mid six figures.
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:53.920]   So it just wasn't, it wasn't worth it.
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:54.920]   Right.
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:59.960]   It was a, it was a lot of work for a modest amount of money, whereas I could have done
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:03.480]   the same amount of work and gotten a much larger amount of money and, you know, paid
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:05.200]   for a year, my kids college tuition.
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:09.040]   That's a, it's a little disappointing to me because, you know, one of the promises of
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:13.680]   the internet revolution was to eliminate the gatekeepers, to give everybody the chance
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:18.120]   to publish, whether it's a blog, a book, a record.
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:19.120]   Yeah.
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.880]   Well, you know, the, I think back to what Brianna was saying earlier, I think the people who
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:28.200]   were early advocates for internet freedom get a lot of stick.
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:32.480]   Some of it fair, some of it not about not pondering, whether just connecting everyone
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:34.400]   to the internet would be good for it.
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:35.400]   Yeah.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:38.440]   You know, I think people like, people don't start organizations like EFF if they, if they
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:39.760]   think it'll all be fine.
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:43.200]   So I think that, you know, there were certainly some people who were worried about the long
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:44.200]   term consequences.
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:48.560]   But what I think we all did miss was that antitrust law was dead.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.280]   You know, that, that Reagan, the last, the last hurrah of antitrust law was breaking up
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:54.400]   AT&T in 1982.
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:59.600]   Microsoft with 95% of the operating system could not be broken up.
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:02.880]   And you know, it just went downhill from there.
[02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:07.440]   And now, you know, the web is five giant websites, filled with screenshots of texts from the
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:08.960]   other four.
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:12.280]   And it's not, it's not because that was inevitable.
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:17.960]   It's because we took a policy choice to allow firms to grow by buying their competitors and
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:22.480]   by using access to the capital markets to do predatory pricing to prevent third parties
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.080]   from entering the market.
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:27.280]   And as a consequence, they were able to build up these things that venture capitalists called
[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:31.580]   the kill zone, which is all of the businesses that big tech is in and all the businesses
[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:33.120]   next to those businesses.
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:34.960]   And no one will invest in those.
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:40.760]   I do think it's worth saying it's not just, you know, it's not just the internet where
[02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:47.080]   you've seen this kind of tech idealism come forward and, you know, say, Oh, like, look
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:51.200]   at, look at, you know, the open internet, right, something I strongly believe in.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:56.560]   But you're like, Oh, the skin democratize information and kind of look at things today
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:57.560]   and it's worse.
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:02.800]   And we said this about the financial industry and, Oh, once we get these brokerages out
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:07.360]   of the way and, you know, people can buy stocks one on one, it's going to be so much
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:08.360]   better.
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:12.440]   We're going to democratize wealth creation across the world and you look at, you know,
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:17.680]   the way they do it with a by the boys, it called a Robinhood flow.
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:21.560]   Yeah, Robin, these forces, which inequality is getting worse.
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:25.680]   You look at the game industry, it's like when steam came out, you're like, Oh, now we're
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:30.680]   not going to be tied to these publishers and we can buy a game from wherever and indie
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:34.280]   people can come forward and make games whenever they want.
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:39.520]   And we'd look at how much, you know, smaller B level games are made to our making today's
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:43.720]   wealth indie publishers and, Oh, actually, the entire system is getting worse.
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:46.720]   So I'm just saying there's a pattern of us.
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:47.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:53.680]   Into things and thinking about very idealistically fast forward 10 years later and everything,
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:55.440]   like the kitchens on fire.
[02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:59.380]   So I'm just saying what I would say is that's completely right.
[02:21:59.380 --> 02:22:03.880]   And I would go even further and say that it's not just that we fail to understand that this
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:08.340]   would happen in tech, but that it would happen across the board as a result of non enforcing
[02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:14.000]   antitrust law, which is why there's four giant shipping companies who no one can regulate,
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.540]   which means that when they just try to realize economies of scale by building bigger and bigger
[02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:20.760]   ships, eventually one of them gets stuck in the Sue as canal.
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:25.180]   And when that happens, they socialize the losses and they privatize those gains.
[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:28.420]   And you know, we have one company that makes all the eyeglasses in the world.
[02:22:28.420 --> 02:22:32.440]   And they also in every eyeglass retailer and the largest lens manufacturer, which makes
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:35.360]   more than half the lenses and the largest insurer.
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:39.080]   It's an Italian French conglomerate called Luxautica, SLR.
[02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:42.600]   And there's like one cheerleading league that is price gouging every cheerleader.
[02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:44.280]   And there's one wrestling league.
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:47.680]   There's two brewers and there's two spirits companies.
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:50.760]   And there's, you know, four giant finance companies that are able to structure whole
[02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:51.760]   economies.
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:53.120]   It's across the board.
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:56.320]   And so, you know, I again, back to this thing, what did tech miss?
[02:22:56.320 --> 02:23:00.260]   I think the thing that tech missed is the thing that a lot of us missed, which is that when
[02:23:00.260 --> 02:23:06.440]   we removed the, when we removed the things that stopped firms from growing by access
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:13.140]   to the capital markets, we created a dynamic where if rich people would give you money,
[02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:17.060]   you could just end up owning a whole market and no one would compete with you and rich
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:21.020]   people like that idea because once you did own the whole market, you could extract monopoly
[02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:25.020]   rents from your customers and monopoly concessions from your suppliers.
[02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:29.420]   Monopoly rents is well, every economist's favorite phrase.
[02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:30.420]   Yeah.
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:31.420]   Yeah.
[02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:37.220]   You kind of when at Crunchbase, we're covering all of this.
[02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:38.220]   Any thoughts?
[02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:42.820]   I mean, I got, I got a, I got a barrel of thoughts.
[02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:43.820]   Yeah.
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:45.020]   Because it's kind of where to start.
[02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:49.820]   I mean, I think that mostly I agree with what our Fanko panelists are saying.
[02:23:49.820 --> 02:23:54.540]   I do think that centralization of corporate power is an issue.
[02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:57.860]   The thing that I get sad about is just the fact that there seems to be absolutely no
[02:23:57.860 --> 02:23:58.860]   redress for it.
[02:23:58.860 --> 02:23:59.860]   Yeah.
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:04.740]   Because Congress is effectively owned by different corporate interests and it's an embarrassment
[02:24:04.740 --> 02:24:05.740]   to the system.
[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:10.180]   However, I'll just say this again, I am a capitalist and I don't see a better way to
[02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:14.020]   organize things other than fighting back as best we can against centralized corporate
[02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:17.420]   power and against the perversion of democracy by money.
[02:24:17.420 --> 02:24:20.660]   In fact, if you are a capitalist, that's what you want.
[02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:21.660]   Right.
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:22.900]   No, I don't think so.
[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:28.220]   I think that wanting to have a market based economy doesn't inherently make you a repacious
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:29.220]   ass hat.
[02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:30.220]   Can I say that on the show?
[02:24:30.220 --> 02:24:31.220]   I was going to say that on the show.
[02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:32.220]   I'm sorry.
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:35.420]   You can absolutely say repacious ass hat.
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:36.420]   Say it again.
[02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:38.420]   No, you did it for me.
[02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:42.980]   And Corey earlier said, Mary, keep kill, which I thought was a really good form of self
[02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:43.980]   censorship.
[02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:44.980]   That was fantastic.
[02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:50.660]   The issue is we have, we have done a good job describing the problem that impacts a lot
[02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:52.700]   of how our world works.
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:56.900]   But I don't think any of us have a way of breaking the log jam of power that we would
[02:24:56.900 --> 02:25:01.780]   need to actually, for example, break AWS off of Amazon.
[02:25:01.780 --> 02:25:03.260]   That should be a relatively easy one.
[02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:06.940]   It is a distinct business that is supportive and related but distinct.
[02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:08.900]   And yet it's never going to happen.
[02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:10.100]   And so that will allow them.
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:12.140]   I think you've missed the main event.
[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:13.660]   We've got Lena Kahn.
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:15.060]   We've got Tim Wu.
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:20.620]   We've got changes to the DOJ, you know, Cantor and we have got more trust by the people.
[02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:26.420]   We have got some trust by the people who have been doing this.
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:29.580]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:31.820]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:33.620]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:33.620 --> 02:25:35.620]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:37.620]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:39.420]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:41.420]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:43.380]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:44.740]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:46.740]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:48.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:50.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:52.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:54.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:56.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:58.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:00.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:02.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:04.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:06.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:08.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:10.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:12.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:14.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:16.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:18.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:20.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:22.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:24.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:26.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:28.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:30.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:32.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:34.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:36.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:38.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:40.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:42.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:44.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:46.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:48.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:50.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:52.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:54.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:56.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:58.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:00.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:02.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:04.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:06.500]   We've got a lot of trust in our world.

[02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:44.500]   This week on Twit, we have managed to put it all together
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:48.500]   into a simple 60 second enjoyable short film watch.
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:50.500]   I got the new S22 Ultra.
[02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:53.500]   I said, "Now, who do I know has floppy wrists?"
[02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:56.500]   And it was just flopping around.
[02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:58.500]   It's easy.
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:35:59.500]   Lifts her phone up.
[02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:02.500]   She's just going to topple over her phone.
[02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:04.500]   She's a little wisp of a lass.
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:08.500]   Previously on Twit, Tech News Weekly.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:12.500]   What if you could have a Nintendo Switch that is also a PC?
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:15.500]   And so that is what this steam deck is.
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:18.500]   And I almost just hit myself in the face with it.
[02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:21.500]   Which wouldn't be too difficult because it's gigantic.
[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:22.500]   It's big.
[02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:23.500]   iOS today.

[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:40.500]   atomic rockets.
[02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:43.500]   You know, when you compare these to chemical rocket engines,
[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:46.500]   the longest the rocket engines ever ran in the Apollo program
[02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:48.500]   were a matter of minutes.
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:50.500]   Atomic engines could run for hours.
[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:53.500]   And this would cut transit times to Mars by as much as
[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:54.500]   possibly 50%.
