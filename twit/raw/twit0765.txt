[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:28.880]   It's time for Twit. This week in Tech, the show where we cover the latest
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.080]   "Twit News." Now we cover the latest tech news. Twit is the show that covers it.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.400]   It's confusing. Christina's here. Hey, Christina Warren, Senior Cloud Advocate at
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.320]   Microsoft, but better known as a podcaster. And for many years of tech
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.560]   journalists and one of our dearest friends, film girl, hi film girl. Hey, Leo, how are
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.200]   you? I'm great. Are you still doing all the other podcasts? Is everything as
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.480]   normal in that regard? Yes. So in that regard, we're still doing rocket every
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.920]   week. And I'm actually, one of the reasons that I was kind of late kind of
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.320]   getting on Twit was I was picking up some stuff because we are moving our
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.760]   channel 9 setups to be recording from home as much as we can. So I needed
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.520]   something to be able to connect my Sony camera to my computer so that I can
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.560]   use it with OBS as a webcam so that I can connect with producers who are also
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.240]   working remotely so that they can do some of our live production stuff that
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.160]   way. It's so much fun for us here at Twit to watch as everybody kind of
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.840]   starts to do the kinds of things we've been doing for our 15th anniversary
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.520]   episodes in two weeks. So it's been a long time. Oh, it's 15 years already. Wow,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.120]   because I knew that was coming up. Yeah. And that's crazy. That's crazy. We
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.200]   didn't start with video, of course, we were audio at first, but it didn't take
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.440]   too long to get video. Yeah, I should mention that in two weeks. It'll be the
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.200]   original Twits. It'll be Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton and Robert Herron doing
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.480]   the show on April 19th as we celebrate 15 years since we started Twit kind of
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.840]   amazing. Also with us Brian McCullough, by that measure, he is a newbie at
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.520]   podcasting the TechMeBriyn Hall mirror. A mere few years old. It's great to see
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   you Brian. Great to see you. By the way, newbie. I just did my 600th episode last
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.400]   week. No, of the TechMeBriyn Hall podcast. Yeah, but you do five a week.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.640]   Actually, more than that, you do seven a week now, right? Right. We do the
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.840]   weekend episodes and I'm doing two podcasts a day because we launched. Wow.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.320]   We shut down one of our other shows, our politics show. And so now three weeks
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.360]   ago, we started the coronavirus morning report. Oh, cool. Oh, I'll start
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.080]   listening to that. That's great. Yes. In the morning, usually by 10 a.m. every
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.360]   weekday morning, the coronavirus morning report. And then as soon as I'm done
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.040]   with that, I start on the TechMeam show and that comes out at four. So what
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.240]   would be the, is there one URL for all of this? Right home media, no,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.200]   right home.info. Okay. I would have all of our shows, but search coronavirus
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.840]   morning report search, TechMeam, right? Yeah, nobody subscribes. He stays. Nobody
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.640]   subscribes by the net. But just so you can see what there is. Nice.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.560]   Corona virus morning report. How long is that 15 to 20 minutes? All our shows
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.160]   are 15 to 20 minutes. Yeah. I understand that. I did clockwise the other day on
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.400]   our relay FM. You've done it, Christina. And it was half an hour and it's like,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.760]   we just started. It's a tight half. I'm just getting started. What do you what
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.880]   over? No. Mostly we go a couple hours. Also want to say hi to another old. This
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.520]   is fun because it's old friends today. Jason Heiner is also here. Jason, of
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   course, was at Tech Republic for many years now. He's editorial director at
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   Cnet every day as a fresh start. It says behind him over his shoulder. That's
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.120]   nice. It's fun. No, thanks for having me. Oh, yeah. Always a pleasure. It's
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.960]   fun to see everybody out of the office. And I don't just mean you guys. I mean,
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.480]   I mean, Anderson Cooper. I mean everybody. It's even the network
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.520]   news now is coming from people's homes. It's so strange. And it's very funny to
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.160]   see them dealing with stuff that we figured out years ago, you know, the guy
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.680]   who insists on using his iPhone headphones as and it's scratching against
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.360]   his collar. And and the I don't the last yesterday I was watching some I can't
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.720]   remember who it was somebody and I couldn't understand him. They had the
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.920]   worst audio in the world. So another guy at Arkansas, he had his phone to his
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.640]   ear because he couldn't figure out how to get audio working. It's just
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.760]   wild to see all of that. But I'm glad to see everybody.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.720]   I'm glad people are doing it. But this is an opportunity for you, Leo. Like if
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.040]   you wanted, you know, you could put out like, you know, Skype or
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.600]   do network quality shows. No, well, no, but what you could do is consulting
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.960]   sessions with some of these broadcast networks. Yeah, I probably should. They
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.800]   don't they don't want to hear from me. They like figuring it out on their own.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.400]   I did good morning America a couple of days ago. And Becky Warley, who's it was
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.960]   their tech geek host, said, can you get the microphone out of the shot? Because
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.480]   as you know, in fact, I always know when I see somebody on the news show with a
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.200]   microphone from, oh, that's a podcaster. We always have our microphones in our
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.040]   face. That's how we do it here. But apparently network is not yet gotten
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.680]   used to that. It's it's enjoyable. And then the other hand, I'm learning new
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.200]   skills. I just bought a sewing machine, gonna gonna start up a little face
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.320]   mask business in my spare time. So sewing machine right there. That was my,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.680]   my wife is doing that all afternoon. Oh, nice. Look at that. Was she making
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.440]   face masks? She was making face masks. Now, do they have a special one for you?
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.320]   Because you got a beard that makes it a little tougher, doesn't it? Oh, look,
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.360]   well, for the seal, I guess. No, but she's there's those kinds where you're
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.920]   supposed to have like an insert, like you can put like a cloth inside it. So it's
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.000]   got a pouch or something. Yeah, she's making. I think so. I love it.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.800]   Home crafts. Oh, she's the instructions on how to do a face mask. Oh, look at
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:26.680]   that. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah, it's a it's the world has changed. It's very
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.880]   in so many unusual and interesting ways. Of course, a lot of people who weren't
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.200]   using zoom, all of a sudden are using zoom, which is I would guess the number one
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.480]   video conferencing technology. Zoom says they went from 10 million daily active
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.640]   users in December to 200 million last month. And of course, as a result, we're
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.280]   seeing all sorts of problems.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   First of all, that's crazy numbers, by the way, before we get into the problem.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.400]   I mean, when have you heard of a platform going from 10 to 200 in a month?
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.800]   That's his Facebook. Yeah, it's incredible. Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.240]   probably the last time we've seen that type of growth, right? It would be
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.520]   Facebook would be. And even then, I don't know if you saw that uptick that
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.720]   quickly. Yeah, potentially once they once they kind of hit their stride and
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.160]   we're going to more and more places, maybe you did like maybe once they
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.320]   really started investing in Asia and South America. But that's probably the
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.520]   last time we've had a zoom wind. It seems like there were was zoom the
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.360]   number one choice in bit. I mean, what about Cisco Webex or go to media?
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   It's easy to use. It's easy to use. Yeah. It's easy to really work.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:48.320]   Really cheap. Right. Start going. It's also that's the problem, though, is it
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.000]   was so easy to use that that's why they're running into these problems. And
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.400]   some of the people are saying that some of the fixes that they're trying to do
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.600]   now are going to be kind of shooting themselves on the foot because even
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.960]   doing something simple, like having a password to join a zoom call is going
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.360]   to make it more difficult for people to use. Yeah. Well, here's an interesting
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.200]   story. Zoom bombing is now a federal offense that could result in
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.560]   imprisonment. I don't know if that's reduced the number of zoom bombs.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.720]   Federal prosecutors are saying that if it was posted as a press release to
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.160]   the Department of Justice website of the US Attorney's Office for the
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.560]   Eastern District of I don't know what state of some state with support from
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.840]   the state Attorney General and the FBI probably New York, I would guess that
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.400]   the most aggressive in something like this. Zoom bombing is a big problem for
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.560]   schools, for churches. I have a friend in a 12 step program or a
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.160]   recovery program. And of course, they can't meet in person anymore. They do
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.240]   their meetings as zoomed at meetings and because they're public of necessity,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   anybody can come in and people are doing horrific, offensive, triggering
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:13.680]   things, not just pornography, not just racial epithets, but intentionally going
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.840]   after alcoholics, things like that. It's just appalling. And it's my
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.200]   understanding that a lot of the organizing is going on. I'm sure it's
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.400]   happening at 4chan and 9chan. Discourses being used. There's a discourse
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:31.880]   channel for zoom bombing where they share public IDs for zoom events so that
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.080]   they can all have so much fun. It's just shocking really how awful some
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.920]   people can be. Yeah, it's funny. My mom sent me like an email. I guess this
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.320]   was maybe maybe Tuesday this week, maybe Wednesday. We were I think in the
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.920]   middle of either the first or the second wave of zoom scandals of the week. And
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.200]   her Bible study is going to be using zoom and she wanted to know she was like,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.480]   should I use this? Maybe I don't want to bother with it at all. And so I like
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.720]   sent her like a detailed thing. I took the time to take the screenshots and go
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.320]   through the process. I was like, this is how you can join from your web browser.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   Just that's going to be your best bet. Don't sign up for an account. Don't do
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.720]   the other things. But I was really proud of her a for reading and keeping up on
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   it and be like asking, okay, what's the best way for me to do this?
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.320]   To miss the news. It's all over the place. Because everybody's using it.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:26.120]   Sure. Yeah, definitely. But still, I'm still proud of my mom for wanting to
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.040]   like know, like, how can I mitigate even asking the question, should I be using
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.520]   this? And like part of me wants to be like, no, don't use this at all. And
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.920]   another part of me is like, yeah, but I don't want you to miss out on being
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.160]   able to connect with people. You know, that's that's to me. I think the hard
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.760]   thing about having the advice to just be don't use this product. If you're an
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.040]   enterprise or a school or something, I think that's one thing. Or maybe you
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.200]   should appeal to the higher authorities who make those decisions to say, have
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.400]   you actually vetted this? But if the decision's already been made, and this is
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.960]   what your school is using or your Bible study or your, you know, you know, AA
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   meeting or something else, that's what they're choosing to do. It's a really, I
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.360]   think, not fair thing to say to regular people, we'll just opt out of this.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.840]   Just don't use this this communication. It's the same thing when people say, oh,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.040]   we'll just don't be on Facebook. You know, where it's like, okay, that's,
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.080]   that's really, that comes from a really privileged position to be able to make
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.720]   that point. Totally. Yeah. And the thing about Zoom, look, there's still lots of
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.760]   great things about Zoom. It's funny. We used to have up until the last couple
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.200]   years, I've even been saying really until the last like 18 to 24 months when Zoom
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   has kind of gotten much more popular. We used to have this joke for the last
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   four or five years of, you know, we've got now we've got self-driving cars, but we
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.480]   still can't get a video call to work. And we still get a PowerPoint, you know, and
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.160]   Zoom really has kind of solved that. It has gotten to where it's made these
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.040]   things easy enough that you can get a lot of people connected. I agree with
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.640]   Christina, it used, people shouldn't be too freaked out about it. Obviously, the
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.360]   NSA shouldn't be using it for, you know, and, and some companies that are doing
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.400]   corporate secrets, you know, you saw SpaceX say that they're, you know, they band it.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.880]   Well, that makes sense. They're dealing with highly proprietary and sensitive
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:19.400]   information, right? That deals with their core business. So that makes perfect
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.400]   sense. For the average people, you know, stuff I had a friend that yesterday did
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:30.200]   there on their Zoom, they did a, their sister's baby shower. And it was amazing.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.160]   And she talked about the fact that what it's enabling them to do. And I did
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.440]   one, this wonderful organization called Interfaith Paths to Peace, because a lot
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.120]   of, you know, a lot of religious organizations, they don't really have
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.400]   tech departments. And so this organization has helped sort of provide a platform
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.120]   using Zoom where people of different faiths can come together and, you know,
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.360]   have fellowship and be able to worship together and get inspiration. So there's
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.800]   great things that are going on with Zoom. The thing where the, the onus is is the
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.240]   people who are hosting these meetings, they just need to implement a few good
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:12.680]   things. Brian mentioned the password thing, which now Zoom is kind of imposing. You
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.080]   can still send somebody a Zoom link with that password essentially embedded in
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.440]   that link. And so it makes it easy for them to just click and join. But if
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.360]   somebody's doing that random looking, you know, typing in random Zoom numbers or
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:33.520]   finding, you know, random Zoom rooms to jump into, they can't get in if they don't
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.640]   have the password. And even then, if you set up a waiting room, the host of a Zoom
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.040]   can help kind of screen people. And if they see people that are jumping in and
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.760]   are being appropriate, you can hit the remove or, you know, jump them back to
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.800]   the waiting room. If for some reason it's somebody you don't recognize. So there's
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.520]   plenty of ways to mitigate this for most people that are using Zoom. It's just
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.640]   that the people who are using it and we're considering using it to do very
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:04.920]   proprietary things, they obviously need to think twice about it. But by the same
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:10.440]   token, it's still better than like we used to do these calls where, you know,
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.120]   you have your just your number, you dial into an 800 number and then you put in
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.400]   your corporate sort of 9-digit ID. Well, the thing is we never knew who was on
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.440]   those calls with Zoom at least you can see who is on there. And so it is
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.440]   generally even more secure, even as insecure as it is right now, the problems
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.120]   it has with encryption and those kinds of things. It's still a step up from the
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.160]   average conference call. But my question is because, you know, we're largely, we've
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   been talking about consumers using this. But the question that I have is, you
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.640]   know, usually you see problems like this when you have a consumer product try to
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.240]   move into enterprise. This is an enterprise product that's suddenly being
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.840]   used by consumers. But there are security issues. Where were the CIOs and CTOs?
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.480]   Where was everybody like checking out all of the security problems that Zoom had
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.200]   before this? Yeah, I think that's a great question. And I actually disagree. I
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.600]   disagree with Zoom. Zoom says that they were in enterprise product that is now
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.800]   being used by consumers. I will say I think that's patently false and I think
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.920]   they're being misleading when they say that. They may have had some specific
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.480]   enterprise, you know, implementations like apparently they have one for HIPAA.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.840]   But the vast majority of the times that I was using Zoom was either for small
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.280]   teams things. I saw a lot of startups using it. Individuals kind of wanting an
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.720]   easy way to set up conference thing systems or hobbyists, you know. So I
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.840]   think that really most of their users before this were small businesses,
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:45.200]   startups, maybe meetings, size business, places that don't have CIOs and CTOs that
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.520]   are going to be looking at index. They would use the SIPB-X Cisco
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.960]   conferencing systems. Much more expensive, much more complicated but better quality.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.760]   Yeah, so I don't think it was, yeah, exactly. It's very much like Slack in that
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.280]   sense. And a lot of people use Slack and Zoom together. And so I actually reject
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.800]   their statement that it was enterprise because I don't think it was. If it was
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.960]   enterprise, to your point Brian, we wouldn't have seen some of these things
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.400]   because that would have been a complete like, you know, breaker. What I think has
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.520]   happened though is that as there were companies, even big companies that might
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.520]   not have had solutions that worked for this number of people, like one of the
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.160]   big, frankly, like this secret software of Zoom, not just its ease of use, but also
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.640]   its quality. And it's relative ease for having very large groups of video chat
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.760]   working together in a way that WebEx and some of the other solutions just can't
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.680]   do. And to my its my knowledge, there's still the only solution where you can see
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.520]   kind of everyone's video at once in that kind of style. And I know that some other
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.720]   products are working at bringing that type of feature up, but they're the only
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.000]   one who does it. There's a great actually there's a great open source
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.560]   solution that I use called JITZY. JITZYY. Yeah, I set up in about 10 minutes. I set up a
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.520]   JITZY server at home that we do. But how many people can you do with that? How
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.920]   many people can you do with that? Because I've heard that it really caps out
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.720]   around 12 or 13. And so that would be my only like remark because I'm talking
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.040]   about people who might need like 20 or over a month. It depends on bandwidth that
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.680]   you have available to it. It can use it. It can do a hundred people easily. In fact,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.280]   I've seen bandwidth tests with JITZY. It's very light on the CPU usage. It's
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.440]   really about bandwidth. The thing to remember with any service is for a video
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.400]   service to work, you know, especially in the way you want where you have the the
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.800]   grid of people. You have to have it unencrypted at the server side. And so
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.920]   when Zoom says it's end to end encrypted, it's not in the same way we
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.760]   understand end to end, which means no one can see it except the participants. Zoom
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:49.160]   can see it. JITZY is the same way. You can you're it's encrypted. But at some
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.320]   point the server needs to coordinate. So it needs to be unencrypted. But the
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.160]   beauty is JITZY is its open source. You can run your own server. I am. And then it
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.320]   is fully private. There's no one can see it. It has it has some of the same
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.400]   problems Zoom would have. You still have to set up a password if you want to
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.240]   protect it. And that's the big problem for churches for schools. Maybe not so
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.920]   much schools, but certainly for churches and recovery groups and groups that
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.760]   want to be public. You can set up a waiting room. You can do all sorts of
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.920]   things, but ultimately you can't lock it down because you want anybody who
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.280]   be able, you know, who wants to come to the meeting, come to the meeting and
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.400]   the problem people are having. And that would be the same problem with it. I
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.440]   think any service.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:34.120]   And I think what happened, I first hated in months ago, when they had that
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.800]   problem and a security researcher warned them about this with malware, they
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.400]   installed on the Mac a web server, a hidden web server that would run all the
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.200]   time on your Mac. Their idea was, of course, you should be able to just click
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.280]   a link and zoom would launch. But this hidden web server did not go away when
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.200]   you uninstall zoom, it stayed there again, so that even if you uninstall zoom,
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.920]   you click a link, zoom behind the scenes does what it needs to do to get to get
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.000]   a thing going. And hackers discovered it and started using it to inject malware
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.440]   into Mac and Tasha's zoom had been warned about this, drag their feet fixing it.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.480]   Apple finally had to push out a fix on their own. Apple actually had to push
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.280]   out a malware fix on Mac and Tasha's because zoom wouldn't fix it. Now, zoom
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.120]   says, you know, in their credit, I guess, that they're going to stop. They said
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.320]   this this week, they're going to stop working on new features. Everybody on
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.880]   the zoom team is going to work on privacy and security features. So I guess
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.440]   the proof will be in the pudding. But I lost faith in zoom when they claimed
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.720]   and then encryption when that wasn't the case. And when they didn't fix the
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.120]   server problem. And of course, then there've been other reported issues, the iOS
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.720]   version sent data to Facebook because they used a Facebook SDK zoom stop doing
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.880]   that. But they only seem to stop this stuff after they get caught. They were
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.720]   routing calls through a China call center. They said, oops, we did that
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.040]   because we were so loaded up. Oops, we won't do that anymore. I don't know,
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.000]   I'm not against zoom. I and I've tried, by the way, we use it for all our sales
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.840]   calls. I try to get Lisa. I said, you know, there's, I have this great JITC server,
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.000]   you could use this. It even has our brand in the name. Because I set up a
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.480]   domain for it. Say, no, zoom, everybody knows zoom, everybody knows zoom. And
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.960]   it's hard to get people to use something else. So I'm hoping zoom will
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.120]   step up there. There's an opportunity here for them to step up. I'm hoping they
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.880]   are too. But I'll, I'm with you. Look, when the thing happened last summer with
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.200]   them installing the web server and honestly, it was their response to that
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.680]   that really bothered me more than it was even the act itself. That initially
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.800]   they, they barred the security researcher. They wouldn't communicate. They tried
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.120]   to kind of sweep it under the rug, say that it wasn't a big deal. And then once
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.640]   they were properly chasing, they had a belated apology. And the whole thing put
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.040]   a bad taste to my mouth. And it was very face book. Very much so. And
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.320]   move fast, break things, apologize later than keep doing it. And our team had had
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.040]   been using zoom. And after that, we were like, we're done. We're not using this
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.920]   anymore. And so I was done with it then. But again, if someone else wants to use
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.240]   it for something, I'm not going to be like, zealous about like, Oh, I refuse to, to
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.080]   use the system you want to do what bothers me now though. And this is the
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.880]   thing that bothers me from all the different issues they've had is that A, I
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.000]   think that one of the reasons that we're seeing this is because they've gone from
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.680]   10 million to 200 million users. So they're getting an outsized amount of
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.200]   attention. And I think if you put this attention on any sort of service, you
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.040]   would see, you would also be able to find flaws, right? But the thing that
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.880]   bothers me is that they have this amazing differentiator in the IRC right
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.760]   now. We're kind of all talking about how the system hasn't changed in 20 years
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.880]   and they're all terrible. And that's basically true. Zoom has been the first
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.240]   thing that works really well. It's easy to set up. I think the reason you saw
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.640]   businesses enterprises who maybe normally would have gone through a stronger
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.800]   vetting process, not go through that process is they suddenly had to be
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.280]   remote for the first time and needed to support a large number of people and
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.120]   just started with it, right? So I think that's another reason why it's had so
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.440]   much adoption. But they have this huge differentiator. They are easy to use.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.680]   It's well done. It has good features. It's high quality. That's something that is
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.000]   a massive differentiator. And rather than using that as the selling point,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.680]   and rather than using that as what they want to focus on, everything that
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.600]   they've done, it seems like has been in search of like sort of growth hacking
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.200]   and kind of cutting corners. And it makes me question a lot of fundamental
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.080]   things about the company. I love the product, but I'm not, to be totally honest,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.440]   I'm not convinced by even that the latest blog post of the CEO put out, I
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.560]   don't really feel like I believe anything. I don't feel like they have
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.200]   proven themselves to be trustworthy, which is so disappointing because this is
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.000]   genuinely a product that is head and shoulders a bit of the competition. And
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.120]   I feel like they're squandering a lot of this by going after ways to grow
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.680]   pack. A lot of things that make Zoom good. Jitsi does, for instance, Jitsi uses a
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.960]   more modern protocol web RTC, which means you don't have to install any
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.080]   software. If you're using Chrome, it's just a link and it does it in Chrome
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.600]   without any additional software. And that's really nice. That really is easy
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.320]   to use. And I look and Jitsi, that's great. I think for being honest, the
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.240]   setup process of people getting started with Jitsi meat, whether they use that
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.720]   service or set up their own instance, it's just anything. I could send you a
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.480]   link right now and you could use it in your browser. No setup. You're just in.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.800]   That's pretty easy. Right. But I mean, like if you're a bit if you're a
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.120]   business and you want to set up your own instances, what I meant, like if you
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.480]   wanted to control, they offer a free of free version. And honestly, if you've
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.960]   got a Debian running or any Debian derivative running, it's a simple apt
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.240]   install, apt install Jitsi meat, you're done. It does let's encrypt
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.200]   automatically. You're done. It was so easy for me to set up. It was trivial. I
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.680]   agree. Many businesses aren't going to want to do that, but you don't have to
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.280]   do that. I could set up watch. I'll just I'll send you a link right now. You
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.640]   can try it. Go to Twitter. I would be I would be cautious about whether Jitsi
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.400]   could support 200 billion daily active users. Should we see?
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:08.280]   Let's see. Twitter team slash Twitch. Let's just let's just see. I'm going to
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:14.320]   set it up. Secure connection failed. Oh, maybe maybe not. Never mind. We'll do
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.760]   this another time. I don't know what happened there. I think one of the
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.360]   things we have to also take into account, you know, there's a lot of
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.520]   self-inflicted wounds on on Zoom's part to Christina's. Yeah, but that's the
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:35.200]   question is, is it accidental? Or are these guys nefarious? As Bruce
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:41.080]   Schneier said in his post, the errors that Zoom has committed fall into three
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.960]   broad practices, bad privacy, bad security, bad user configurations. That
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.360]   doesn't that doesn't sound like ineptitude. That's starting to sound a
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.200]   little bit like. And there's a fourth too, because they were sort of leaving
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.800]   doors open to do tracking and they were well because they had a free tier and
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.240]   they wanted to monetize the free tier. I don't know. I think yeah, no, I think
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.440]   that the the comparison to early Facebook is especially, I think poignant
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.840]   because of they were it was it was very much like you say, move fast, break
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.240]   things, innovate, create a great product and you apologize later when we make
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.600]   some mistakes. Not a great business model. I think, you know, Facebook is
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:29.360]   is finally feeling the pain of that from a user standpoint and it's likely
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.520]   to other than it has been some indication that more some of the people
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.920]   who've left Facebook are going back during this time. But also people have a
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.280]   ton of time on their hands. So, you know, I don't know if I take that as a long
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:49.520]   term. Yeah, for geeks. So this is for all of us a question. Because we all this
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.760]   is not an unusual conundrum for geeks. We know better. We know that this isn't a
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.760]   good idea. We know what's wrong with it. We know in great detail what's wrong
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.120]   with it. And yet, I mean, I had a we had a family meeting on Friday and I tried
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.960]   to use my server, my JITC and one one member couldn't get it working. So we
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.040]   went back to Zoom for geeks. It's easy to say, Oh, yeah, here's all the reasons.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:18.240]   But as you said, Christina, it's hard and zoom just works. So what should we say
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.880]   as geeks? I mean, I did a radio show on Thursday and I said, well, yeah, it's got
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.560]   all these problems. But I know it's easy to use. So go ahead. It's it's it's not
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.080]   that dangerous. Is it?
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.720]   We don't know. I would Christina go ahead.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.840]   I would be really. Can I tell people not to use it?
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.760]   I'm not going to tell people not to use it. I am going to say if you're going to be having
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.160]   any source of conversations where you might be sharing really private or personal things that
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:52.880]   you're worried about, maybe other people having access to, I would be I would be sensitive to
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.880]   that. Like for instance, if you know, a school is using it, I would say, okay, look, I understand
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.760]   we can't switch, you know, what we're doing mid cycle. But when the school year starts up again,
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.560]   if we're still doing, you know, learning from home stuff, look at using another solution.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:12.880]   And I would say definitely to people, even if it causes more friction, you know, set a password
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.880]   for the meeting that you're doing, because as Jason said, you can send out a link that has the
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.040]   password appended to it, which still makes it relatively easy to join. I'm not at the point.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.920]   So still, by the way, though, everybody who clicks that link will install zoom on their system.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.760]   And that's problematic, right? It sits there for the rest of your life.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.880]   I mean, you can choose not to install it. And there is a way you can join from the web browser,
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.680]   which they try to hide. So you don't have to install. Yeah, they try to hide it away. This is
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.560]   what I said to my mom, I like annotated the whole thing. And I was like, this is what you need to do
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.120]   to join your Bible study. Don't install the app. And so that's kind of what I'm telling people.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.440]   I'm like, look, don't install the app. Use it from Chrome or a Chrome based web browser,
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.360]   because I think it might have some issues in Firefox and Safari. And, you know, don't create
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.800]   an account if you're not super comfortable with that. If you have the opportunity to use alternatives
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.520]   and you think people will do it, I think I would go there. But I'm not at least me just
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.960]   speaking for me, I'm not yet at the point where what they're doing, even though I don't have a lot
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.600]   of trust in the company, I'm not yet at the point where I want to say to people don't use this,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.960]   because I don't know if any of the replacement solutions we have are consumer friendly enough
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.200]   where, you know, you can make that assertion without having, okay, well, what are we going to use?
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.440]   That's the conclusion I came to. I told them about other choices like Jami and Jitsi,
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.920]   which are open source. But I said, but you know what, it's not the end of the world if you zoom.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.800]   What do you think, Brian? What do you tell people?
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:48.480]   I tell people that the people that are also winning aside from Zoom would be our friend
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.920]   Christina Microsoft and their teams products, who were the ones that were reporting the biggest
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.360]   numbers before Zoom revealed their numbers. And by the way, Christina, I will say this.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.720]   The joke I made on my show was, you know, how the old saw used to be, no one ever got fired
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:08.960]   for going with IBM. Like my wife's architecture firm, it was no question. As soon as they knew
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.600]   they had to work from home, they said, all right, Microsoft teams, it is.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.760]   Oh, that's good. That's good. Yeah.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.800]   And being better, I mean,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.760]   teams is going to benefit from this, but they only have 50 million.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.840]   Daily, actually subscribers. Did Microsoft not offer a free during this crisis of free?
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.600]   There is a free version. There is a free version. The way that it's set up right now,
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.040]   though, like you can do it as an individual, you can do it for schools and for other things.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.200]   And it's, I think, like a six month freeze is what they've got offered.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.720]   One of the speed bumps is though, you have to create a Microsoft account.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.560]   No, actually, some of the personal things you can actually authenticate with a non-Microsoft
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.880]   account. The issue is it's still not going to be as seamless for setting up something like teams
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.960]   as it would be to do something like Zoom, because teams is kind of a combination between something
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.600]   like Zoom and something like Slack, you know, you have, and it's, frankly, it's SharePoint underneath.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.960]   So there's like a whole file server component. There's the chat function, and then there's the
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.640]   video part. They did announce this week, I believe, and I don't know, I don't work on that team,
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:14.080]   so I don't know the details, but there's going to be a more consumer version of teams, I think,
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:19.120]   that's going to be coming later in the year. And Microsoft 365 productors will get to.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.240]   Yeah. Yeah. And that, I think, look, I think the sooner they can do that, the better,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:29.280]   because there's clearly an appetite for this. And look, it may be more competition,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:36.160]   will make Zoom take some of these concerns more seriously and, you know, get in a way where
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.000]   they're engineering and their other kind of business decisions make us all feel a little bit
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.920]   better. So it didn't get you your recommendation, though, Brian. What do you tell
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.880]   people? Do you say you Zoom? It's okay. It's not so bad.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.200]   Everyone I know uses FaceTime anyway.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:57.600]   Yeah. They're all app users. That's a better choice. 32 people in a group. That's usually enough.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:04.240]   And that's what, you know what I did do, though, it hasn't come yet. I did break down and by the
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.120]   Facebook portal, and I'm going to try that out. I got the one where you can put it in front of your
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.400]   TV. Yeah. Well, did you see that? Someone wrote an article a week ago that totally convinced me
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.320]   they're like, this is the time for it. It's mainly because I have a three year old and a five year old.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.960]   And I'm tired. Grandma has Facebook. Exactly. Exactly. So theoretically, like I said,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.080]   I haven't gotten it yet. That TV version, it's like a sound bar you put it underneath the TV.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:35.520]   And then it has that Facebook technology where it follows people around, which three months ago
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:41.440]   sat at Creepy as hell. But right now, if I don't have to sit there be the cinematographer the
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.400]   whole time, every time we talk to Grandma and Grandpa, that sounds pretty darn good to me.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.000]   I have to say, though, that any solution that requires you have to have an iPhone or you have
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.400]   to be a Facebook member or you have to have a Microsoft account is going to be difficult,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:00.080]   certainly for schools. Although somebody just told me the New York City schools are using teams.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:08.000]   Yeah, 100%. So I've got a kindergartner. They do. They have done, I think the video
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.400]   meetups are on Zoom, but then all of their work stuff is submitted and is like they get the
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:20.800]   materials through Microsoft Teams as well. By the way, I figured out why I can't get to Jitzy from here.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:27.200]   We have too good of an IT department. Cisco umbrella is blocking access to my server.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:35.280]   Russell, could you please open? But that's a problem, right? I bet you Zoom goes right through.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.160]   I think I know it goes right through. Probably true. That's another issue.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.280]   What do you tell people, Jason? Yeah, so I think the other, so I tell them
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:51.600]   continue to use Zoom, but a lot of the onus is on Zoom hosts to improve some of their best practices
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:58.720]   in these things. Also, even before this, I told people, you know, if you got something really
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.040]   confidential, you don't want to be doing it in any of these platforms.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.480]   What would you use if you really wanted to be private?
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.120]   I mean, a phone.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   It's true. No, it's true. The phone company is more protected than any digital service.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.080]   Yeah. For historic reasons, if nothing else.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.560]   Exactly. For all of these things, I don't have a ton of trust in them.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.680]   Today, it's Zoom, but it's because Zoom is under the spotlight.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.160]   If it was another one of these products, another one of these products,
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.000]   we'd be kicking the tires on it and we'd be finding all the problems that they have,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.040]   which isn't a terrible thing, right? Because if you have that much attention and you have
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:48.000]   that many people using it, by all means, you deserve to have that kind of scrutiny.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.840]   And then, you know, if they want to stay in business, they will fix these things.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:01.680]   I think the challenge is that, you know, the more consumer-friendly something is,
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.400]   they're just as this natural push and pull, right? Security and convenience.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.880]   And it's a tough, tough line to walk in. That's not an excuse for Zoom.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.480]   But I think some of these things are a little bit of an inevitability of
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.680]   they made things so easy. They tried to make things so easy.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.440]   That the horrible web server thing, which is a terrible idea.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.000]   But at the core, it was one of those things that made it simple enough that you could just
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.120]   send somebody a link and they could easily get into a video conference, one of the hardest
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.080]   problems to solve over the past couple decades, as we've talked about.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:43.200]   And so, you know, there's just those tough trade-offs that not everybody really wants to
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.240]   think about or is going to think about, you know, the average consumer.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:53.440]   So, these things are a necessary part of Zoom being under the spotlight of so many people using it.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.640]   They've made some really portrait-resistant things that they've got to fix.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.240]   And I hope that they do to all the points that everybody's made,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.280]   because it is a good product. They have solved some things.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:09.920]   And now they really need to up their game on privacy and security while still holding the
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:15.920]   balance on usability. And I don't envy them that, but that's an important work that they're going to
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.280]   need to do. There is some question about, apparently,
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:25.440]   the Washington Post found a treasure trove of Zoom video recordings on the internet,
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:31.600]   including one-on-one therapy sessions, training orientation for workers doing telehealth calls,
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.400]   which included people's names and phone numbers, small business meetings, which included private
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.280]   company financials, elementary school classes in which children's faces, voices, and personal
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.160]   details were exposed. A video, including nudity, such as one where an
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:52.720]   esthetician teaches students how to give a Brazilian wax, maybe useful, but probably they
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.800]   didn't expect that to be stored on the internet. Apparently, they're in S3 buckets, in a lot of
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.960]   cases, how they're getting recorded is Zoom doing that and the background is unknown.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:09.200]   Schneier's bottom line is Zoom is a security and privacy disaster, but until now, it managed to
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.760]   avoid public accountability because it was relatively obscure. Now that it's in the spotlight,
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.800]   it's all coming out. He mentions the company's announcement. They're going to work on security.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.560]   Let's see if that's anything more than a PR move. In the meantime, I think he agrees with what
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.360]   we've all said. You should either lock down Zoom as best you can or better yet abandon the platform
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.880]   altogether. He mentions also Jitzy as a distributed free and open source alternative.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:43.600]   By the way, before Elon Musk's SpaceX banned the use of Zoom, NASA had forbidden it for some time.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.640]   I don't think the Department of Defense allows it. People who do pay attention to security
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:58.480]   have a long banned Zoom. I think it's just unknown whether Zoom is poorly run or malicious.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.720]   But either way, it's not a good luck.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.480]   It almost doesn't matter right now. I think, ultimately, whether it's in confidence or
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:15.920]   just people having nefarious purposes, that ultimately is a good question to ask. Right now,
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.240]   I don't think it matters. It's just a matter of being aware of what these things are.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.280]   And as Jason said, any place that had this much attention would be having similar scrutiny and
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.040]   we would find similar things that would make us uncomfortable. That said, there are some things
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:35.120]   about this that do seem to be even more making me go, "Ah, actually, I don't know about this."
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.720]   It's hard to tell, but it might actually be worse than others.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:44.800]   Brian Krebs. I don't disagree with that. I'm just saying, I don't want it to go into a place of,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:50.720]   "Oh, well, if we weren't putting any other insert-here service under the spotlight,
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:56.240]   it would be completely fine just because it's been vetted by big IT teams." That's not necessarily
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   true either. And hackers have a tool Brian Krebs tweeted this a couple of days ago
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:07.200]   called Z-War Dial that will find 100 unprotected Zoom meetings an hour. You could just run it and
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.560]   run it and run it and find these meetings. And I would guess that's what the Zoom bombers are
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:16.320]   using. And while the feds are saying it's a federal crime, you could do jail time. Most of these
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:21.280]   kids are smart enough and know enough to keep themselves anonymous while they're doing this nasty,
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:28.480]   nasty work. That's all right. You know what? For a lot of families,
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:36.800]   house party is a good choice. Do play games on house party. FaceTime. If you've all got iPhones
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:44.080]   or Apple devices, FaceTime is again encrypted except for Apple. But people, I think, trust Apple a
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.200]   little bit more than Zoom. They certainly have better security policies in place.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   And you could email them through this book portal, you nut. I bought two of those big tall portals
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.320]   when they first came out. But I was thinking of giving one to my mom. I didn't want to inflict
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.880]   that on her. But we do phone calls all the time over FaceTime and it works great. In fact,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.200]   I'll set mom up. We used to do this with the Echo Show. I do it with FaceTime now. Put her on the
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.360]   iPad and set her up while I'm cooking dinner and stuff. And it's a great way to kind of,
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.720]   for all of us who are, you know, she's 87, she's alone, she's isolated. It's a great way for us
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.440]   to be together. And I think I'm glad Zoom exists. It's a tool people are using.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:29.840]   And I'm glad it exists. There are alternatives. But I take to say, oh, don't you Zoom, pad.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.800]   Now, imagine if Apple actually did open source FaceTime like we promised all those years ago.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.440]   God, if only.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:41.920]   If only. I think that was actually a patent thing that was not, from what I've talked
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.720]   to people about, I think what actually happened there was it was a patent role
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.320]   who said there was something, I guess, within the FaceTime protocol that violated something.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:48.800]   That's right.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.240]   And that was the link why it was the verdict.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.280]   It was the verdict.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:56.160]   And I think when Steve, so Steve said we're going to make it open source in the announcement.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:01.280]   I think they didn't anticipate that there were some encumberment, whether it was genuine or not,
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.920]   that would make it impossible for them to do that. So I don't think this was a case of Apple
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.600]   walking that back as they wanted to protect their profits. I think it was something else.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.560]   Let's take a little break. We have lots more to talk about. It doesn't have to be the Zoom
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:22.640]   show, but I thought it'd be good to kind of do the ultimate discussion of Zoom.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.280]   So everybody kind of get that out of our system.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.640]   No more. Now I want to talk about outfitting your home office.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:34.480]   We're all working at home, right? And poor Lisa at first was sitting on a dining room chair.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.720]   She put extra cushions on it.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:43.280]   I am so glad fully is here. I can't wait. I got the capisco chair by HAG. It's beautiful.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.680]   This is a chair that lets you sit backwards or forwards.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.960]   You can ride it backwards or you can sit forwards. It has all these buttons and
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.680]   dobs and dials, all sorts of adjustments. There's all sorts of thoughtful touches too.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.880]   This is a chair that can go very high or very low, but has a footrest that makes it extremely
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.920]   comfortable no matter what level you're sitting at. Here's the desk. This is one of the
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   rising desks. They have this is the Quora. It's a standing desk converter. It's very lightweight.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.160]   It's thin. You can put it on any desk and turn it into a standing desk. I love that.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.920]   I just love everything fully sells. If you're ready to turn your office into a much more
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.640]   comfortable, look at the TikTok. That's a fun little stool you sit on that moves back and forth
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.320]   with you. It makes your office somewhere you want to be. I suspect a lot of people who are working
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.720]   from home right now are going to say, I'm staying. If you make your office good enough,
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.640]   they also have the Jarvis Monitor Arm, which I ordered so we can get my monitor up off the desk.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:48.880]   Fully is here to transform your workplace with furniture designed for health, for flow, for balance.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.760]   It's helping people and businesses across the US, Canada and Europe make the transition to
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.920]   working from home with modern, good looking, environmentally friendly, ethically manufactured
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:06.000]   office furniture. They ship free, direct, and next day. You don't have to feel chained to the
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.320]   kitchen table or whatever makeshift workstation you're set up on. We've moved Lisa off of the
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:19.760]   kitchen table to a standing desk that goes up and down. Fully's chairs encourage healthy sitting
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:26.240]   in a variety of postures. That's really nice. You can move around. Keep blood flowing. Keep your
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.040]   mind engaged. I just really like what fully is doing. Whether you're shopping for yourself or
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:36.640]   your entire team, fully is here to help. If you're looking to transition your entire team, call them.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.960]   They can help set you up. If you're an individual, just want to get a really comfortable desk or
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:51.200]   chair, you could say $50 off the Jarvis standing desk by going to fullyfulley.com/twit.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:57.040]   Fully.com/twit. You get $50 off the standing desk and you tell them you heard it on
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:03.840]   Twit. That helps us a lot. Fully is everything you need to make your work flow. I love my fully
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:12.160]   products you will too. Fully is awesome. A really nice company too. I love the fully story. It's
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.760]   just really cool. Thank you, fully. One of the new sponsors, we have several new sponsors on the
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.880]   show today. I'm glad to say it. It's been a tough time, I think, for a lot of our sponsors,
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:28.320]   because sales have dried up and gone away. We've led a lot of sponsors out of their
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.760]   contracts, but then you're getting new sponsors that offer products that are suited to this
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:45.520]   new era we're in. I thought by now we'd have an iPhone 9. I thought it was going to happen
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.240]   Tuesday. I thought it was going to happen Wednesday. Still nothing, right? Christina,
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:57.280]   you probably have your ear to the grindstone. I try. I try. Yeah. I mean, you know, the name
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:03.280]   is apparently going to be what the iPhone SE is what the leak from the screen protector
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:12.080]   on the website store said. Is that bother you? They're keeping the old SE name. The old SE
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:19.920]   was based on an iPhone 5 and very small. It was 4.7 inches. This is based on what an iPhone 6S
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.760]   8. This is based on the 8. This is big. This is much bigger.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:31.360]   Well, it's bigger. Like the old SE. No, well, it's bigger, but it's still smaller than the
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:37.280]   phones that are being sold right now. So it's not the 8 Plus. So it still has touch ID. It doesn't
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.440]   have the FaceTime camera. It doesn't have 3D touch, which is supposed to help battery.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:46.560]   And this is going to still be, I think that's the name is fine because it is going to be physically
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:53.440]   smaller than either the iPhone 11, the 11 Pro or the 11 Pro Max, which is still the worst name
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:47:02.720]   ever. But I call it the 11 Flow Max, but maybe that's funny. I like my 11 Pro Max very much,
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:08.880]   but not the name. So is it still going to be the smallest phone that they offer? It's just going to
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.720]   be. Some people are disappointed. I know some people really like having a small phone,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.160]   but they had to make it bigger also because I think they're putting a modern processor.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:24.320]   The same chip is in the iPhone 11 Flow Max. They're the A13. They're putting more
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:32.560]   memory in it, and I'm sure more storage in it. Anyway, I lost a bet. I was sure they weren't going
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.560]   to call it the 9 because it makes no sense once you've got to 11 to go back to 9.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.600]   I thought and I didn't think they called the SE because of the association with a very different
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:47.840]   looking phone. I thought they just call it iPhone. That's what they call the base model $329 iPad.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:55.440]   It's iPad. But I lost that bet. It's going to be according to 9 to 5 Mac, the iPhone SE.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:02.480]   I don't even remember. What does SE, is that supposed to, I know there's the iPhone S originally.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.920]   What is the E?
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:10.080]   It's for speed. They never told us. You know, especially the small edition. I don't know.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.440]   They never told us. I remember when the SE came out, and it was four years ago,
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.000]   it was one of the only times I've ever had a briefing with Apple where they gave me a phone,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.920]   and they said, "Well, there's no embargo, so you can post on it whenever." I was like,
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.720]   "Okay, well, I have to get a review up in 24 hours, and thanks for the heads up."
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.280]   Thanks, Apple.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   Thanks, Apple.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.760]   Unfortunately, that was relatively easy to do other than battery life because
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:38.560]   the phone, the guts, is the same as the 6S. It was a 6S, but with the body of the 5.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.120]   So I'd already reviewed the phone before. I'd ask them, it was like, "What does SE stand for?"
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.920]   And they were like, "There's no official thing that it stands for, so I don't know."
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.480]   So, so, so.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:52.720]   It's kind of like, it's kind of like 10R. I don't know what the moniker,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.200]   somebody somewhere knows, but I have not heard.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.800]   It just feels like the, remember the old Mac SE? That's what it feels like.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:07.120]   There's somebody there that is like, "You know what? Let's give a quiet nod back to the Mac SE,
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:12.000]   because it was like the small, it was the first like all-in-one package."
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.600]   That's a good point.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:19.120]   Really the Mac that really made the Mac at that time.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.280]   Dr. Muffin, our chatroom says it should be called the Sucker's Edition.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.160]   No. It's actually a good deal.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.760]   It's a very good line.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.560]   400 bucks. If you want a smaller or less expensive phone with modern processing,
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.160]   so you can continue to use features of the operating system, that's a great deal.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:42.560]   I was just going to wonder if they're still going to sell the 8.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.280]   They're still selling the 8 and then the 8 plus.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:53.520]   And the 8 is 4.7 inches, which is what this one is supposed to be reportedly.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:50:00.560]   And then the, but the plus is 5.5, so it's much more like the,
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.080]   I wonder if they'll still sell the plus, but not the, anyway.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.280]   It's no.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.240]   I don't know.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.040]   They might, they did that before, where I think that they were still,
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.360]   I think when the SE came out, I think they were,
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.520]   I don't know if they were still selling the regular,
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.000]   I think they were selling the 6.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.080]   I don't know if they were selling the 5s.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.920]   So, because right now they're selling, yeah, I could see them dropping and maybe keeping the
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:28.960]   plus around, but I bet when next year rolls around, they might only sell like last year's 11,
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:36.640]   and then have the SE and not go back as far as selling like the 10R or something like that,
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.600]   which I don't even think they still selling where I think they dropped that entirely.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.360]   So, the really crazy thing is they might still sell the 8 because they,
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.600]   I'm sure they still have a, there's been no reports of that thing going out of inventory.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:54.080]   They may drop the price of that 8 down to like $1.99 or $2.50 or something,
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.840]   which would be insane.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.400]   Then you would see a ton of those getting bought up.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:04.000]   Oh yeah, I would buy a couple, not just to have like pay as you go plans,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.280]   just to have basically souped up iPod touches, to be honest. If it were that price,
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:14.240]   I would buy like three right now just for like random IPod touches or for international travel.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:19.920]   Apple's never chased the low cost market, but I mean, I think there's an opportunity.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:25.360]   I think Android, I'm an Android fan, but all the security issues with Android,
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.160]   all the problems with Android, I'm starting to think, maybe just everybody should have an iPhone.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:36.000]   And if they offer them as low as 200 bucks up to 1200 bucks, if there's a full range of products,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.560]   it gets easier to say that. The same thing with, we were just talking about FaceTime.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:44.000]   You have to have an iPhone to use FaceTime, but if everybody has an iPhone, that's a good
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.280]   alternative. Jason, are you standing up?
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   I am, yeah.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.520]   Because I just took a stutter step and I thought, wait a minute, he's not sitting in a desk,
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.800]   he's standing up. Good for you. Do you always stand up?
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:02.640]   I do. I do have a, like it's funny, I loved the little, the last company,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.560]   fully, yeah. Last sponsor, fully, because I have a little thing that I use every once in a while.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.880]   You see me go like that. It's because I'm picking up this.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.360]   Oh, you have a little wobble chair. Yeah. Yeah. I do.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.520]   I just kind of will clean a little.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.120]   It's got two. It's like a figure eight, so it can hold each cheek separately.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.480]   That's right.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.640]   Okay. That's just my mind. That's where I went.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.600]   White, 9 to 5 Mac, white, black, and product red.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:33.520]   Nice. I like the reds. I got a red 10R. I loved it.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:41.040]   Five cases, black silicone, white silicone, red leather, black leather, and midnight blue leather.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:47.920]   And the storage tiers, Apple will offer a 64 gig, 128 and 256 gig.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.000]   Obviously, if they're going to keep it at 400 bucks, that'll be the 64 gig.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.040]   Model. But we thought they didn't. Everybody said it'll be this week.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.480]   Silence out of scooper Tino.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.120]   If they do, they're obviously not going to do an event, but you figure they would do like,
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.080]   I don't know, a five, 10 minute video or something like there.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:13.200]   There's no way that they would release a new iPhone and just update the store, right?
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.800]   No, they did for the first test. That's exactly what they did.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.080]   If you had a press release update. Yeah, it was a press release. They had briefings with a few
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.280]   members of the media. And like I said, there was, it was the only time I've ever had an iPhone
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.760]   where there wasn't an embargo because usually what happens is they have a couple of different
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.160]   layers of, you know, when the announcement goes out. So they have the big unveil at the Apple
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.720]   event and then depending on what tier the reviewer is in, they get their device either,
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:44.720]   you know, two weeks or a week or the week of the release. And sometimes you might even have a
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.600]   briefing after the product comes out. And this is the only case I ever remember having a briefing
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.680]   and then asking, okay, well, when does the embargo lift? And they're like, there's no embargo.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.600]   I don't want to do it now. Yeah.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.480]   There was a rumor. I think somebody prosser tweeted last week, I think that the briefing's
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:05.280]   going on now. So I thought, yeah, but maybe, yeah, so, so it might, it might, well, the only
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.720]   thing that made me question if it was going to come out, like once it hit Thursday and it hadn't
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:13.680]   been announced, I was like, Oh, they're not going to Friday news something. So maybe they like
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.440]   Tuesdays. But I mean, I could see you as a Monday drop too.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:23.040]   This will be, you know, this is these are unprecedented, weird times, Apple. I mean,
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:29.760]   imagine the difficulty Apple's having in looking at these phones because normally they, you know,
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.600]   if you're going to, if you're designing this, if you're working on this, you go into a building
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:38.720]   that's completely sealed, it's locked, you have to have special access, you can't take anything home,
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   they check you now people are tough. I guess take stuff home Bloomberg had an article Apple tests
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:51.680]   its secrecy somewhere new employee homes. This is Mark Gurman, of course, because it's Bloomberg.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:58.320]   And it's it's got to be a challenge for Apple to a lot of things that Apple does, they never
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:04.000]   thought about work from home. They did put out a notice to staff saying whether you're working
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.680]   at home or at the office, it's always critical to keep confidential work confidential.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:14.720]   Always securely store confidential items and documents when not in use. Somebody told me that in some
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:20.800]   cases they were giving employees special safes in which to store these these new products so
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:26.720]   they could keep them from keep them from prying journalists. You'd have to also even just from
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:31.920]   seeing like family members come up with stumbling across stuff that they're not supposed to see
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:40.400]   at right. It's got to be a challenge because of course you want to keep working but it's not easy.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   And then there's the production issue although China says Fox Foxconn says its factories are now
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.440]   coming back up to full speed. I don't know if that's to yeah well the problem is is that is that
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.400]   China's not living anybody flying to China. So what's happened is that yeah the factories are coming
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:02.160]   back online but there's no employees to supervise. And the issue is because they very much
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.480]   understandably have to keep the factories under locking key and you have to have a lot of special
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:12.160]   permission to even have like a phone that has a photo capability or anything is that they only
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:16.640]   have like a set number of approved devices. And typically how you can take a photo on the factory
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.880]   floor is you have to use a certain type of camera. You have to physically take the media card out of
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:27.440]   it, put it into a computer and then securely transmit it. And so it can add sometimes a day
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   of what used to be able to be maybe a couple of minute interaction to get questions that are
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:41.840]   happening on the line or other issues back within engineer in San Francisco. So that I think is a
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:48.480]   bigger problem is that people can't fly out and can't be there. So that's I think the bigger challenge
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:54.000]   rather than the factories are closed or not. >>German says Apple did with a lot of companies are doing
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.960]   I'm sure you're doing at Microsoft we're doing a twit we had a contest for employees to share photos
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:04.640]   of their work from home setup. Apple a little bit different though they said if you're working on
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:12.640]   anything confidential please keep it out of the shot. >>Yeah. Yeah we've we have there's an interesting
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:18.160]   feature in teams where you can I guess kind of like redact or like hide certain things on your
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:22.720]   video. >>And so there've been so there've been a couple of calls that I've been on with people who
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:31.440]   have things that are under like in the game or a neo. >>I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:38.640]   But those are certain things that they can kind of redact and so I think that you can see that.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:44.160]   >>What is your black blob? What do you get? >>Like it basically yeah it's like it's colored like
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.400]   there's like a color on top of it so it's just like a colored box so you can't see. >>It's almost
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:54.240]   saying I would just do it all the time you know and say oh you know because then it makes you look
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:01.040]   high status. Look at all the colored blobs. That guy's not everything. You must really have
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:07.040]   special access. Speaking of which I had maybe I maybe you could help me out with this Christina.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:13.280]   Very nice lady Vera called me up she said I can't afford to buy a new computer could you use your
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:19.680]   cloud with Microsoft to ask them to keep Windows 7 up to date through the rest of the year
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:25.920]   due to this crisis. I said one of you crazy I have no cloud. I know Christina Warren could you do
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:34.000]   that for us? >>I mean I don't think you're but it does raise an interesting question about like
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.240]   if there are situations where maybe support should be extended. >>This would be a good reason to
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:48.240]   keep support going although I just I just don't see. I imagine in my mind as an area of me calling
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:55.680]   my good friend Satcha saying Satcha do me a favor do a buddy a service here. Can you just
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:01.840]   keep support in Windows 7 at the end of the year and Satcha just laughing me out of the office.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:07.120]   I don't it doesn't seem like that's something Microsoft would even consider. I mean they're
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:13.280]   doing a lot of other things but that I don't see I don't see happening. According to
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.400]   9-5 Mac iPhone 9 case inventory is already at best by
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:28.080]   were you is that what you were doing there? >>No no I was getting I was getting this.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:36.640]   >>Okay. >>Oh that's nice. >>Yeah it's the HG60S but it's the plus version which is important
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:45.600]   because that means that it can work as a UBC driver on Mac to use your webcam your DSLR as a
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:52.640]   webcam on Mac and it also does 4k pass through which the 60s does not so just a little catch.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:59.520]   >>That's cool so it's a streamer just plug it in. >>Yeah yeah that's neat. Earlier this week we
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:05.840]   Blackmagic did a kind of just a stream to talk about their products new products. They said this
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:11.680]   is not in lieu of NAB which is closed but they showed we have the ATEM Mini which we love it's
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:19.120]   a little $300 for HDMI switcher perfect for this kind of thing. >>Yeah I've looked at getting one
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.320]   of those they're sold out everywhere. >>You can't get them and they announced a new one $300 more
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.400]   the pro version ATEM Mini Pro that has that streamer built into the switcher so you can stream
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.080]   directly from the switcher which is kind of cool. >>That's very cool. >>Yeah Apple did something odd
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:43.040]   this week they bought a weather app. I'm really curious what you all think of this I love dark
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.240]   sky it's my I love it too. >>Yeah preferred weather app a few people annoyed because
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:54.880]   immediately they announced that's it on Android no more dark sky on Android and they said and the
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:03.520]   dark sky API will be cut off at the end of 2021. A lot of us use the dark sky API I use it on a
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:09.760]   lot of different apps I think care whether uses it a lot of them. >>A lot of hello weather does.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:15.280]   >>Yeah care it weather there's a lot of great apps that use it so it's a bummer. >>Dark Sky was
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:22.160]   in 2015 a Kickstarter project they raised it's kind of funny to look back now they raised $40,000
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:31.280]   to create what they called a hyper local weather forecasting service. I'm not sure how they're
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:39.360]   doing hyper local they they implied there was some use of AI or something. >>Yeah sorry go on sorry
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.120]   I got into something on Twitter with somebody this week about that because I send in reports
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.760]   all the time like that's part of it is that you can say you know what's your weather right now or
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.760]   if it starts raining or whatever and someone on Twitter said well it never works in real time
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.440]   for me and I'm like I don't know if it's just because I always send in reports all the time
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.400]   but like it for the last two years or whatever like as soon it'll give me five minute notice
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:08.400]   without sale. >>And it's accurate. >>It's going to rain. >>That's nice. >>Now it's also I'm here in New
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.320]   York City so that could be a part of it too. >>There's more people reporting in your area.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.960]   >>But like ways ways is more accurate where people use it a lot right. >>Exactly.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.640]   >>Yeah. >>And then so by the way I wanted to say because this is on 9 to 5 Mac right now but I was
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:29.120]   writing up a piece on it for tomorrow before we started there's new rumors about new home screen
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:35.360]   appearance options in iOS that that people have noticed. >>I saw this and this gets me very excited.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.840]   So then put all these things together. Number one the weather app on iOS has sucked out for months
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:49.280]   and then suddenly if we can have widgets on the home screen that are active put it all together
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:56.320]   and I think we can see pieces coming together here. >>So yeah tell me this is iOS 14 and you have
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:02.000]   to look at the code. Is this from the leaked code or is this from an actual beta of 14? This is
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.600]   from the leaked code isn't it? >>It says screenshot off or else revealed a new home screen appearance
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.520]   option that is similar to the watch face settings from the Apple Watch app. >>So you can have
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:21.680]   complications on your iPhone. >>Exactly. >>Yeah. >>This is already dynamic wallpapers coming right
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.720]   that's what that that leakers had talked about that coming like a stripes that move across the
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:33.440]   screen. >>Well I have live wallpaper on my iPhone. Apple has some dynamic ones but maybe they're
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:40.560]   real time like the I love the idea of having the planet Earth and the demarcation line moving as
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.920]   it actually moves that kind of thing. >>Or maybe similar to like what the one that they have on
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.480]   Mac OS where depending on what update it is it'll get a darker or lighter. So that would be cool.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.240]   >>This is one of the things I love about Android. One of the few reasons I would hate to have to
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.280]   give up Android is widgets. The Android and this is where I think Apple is really behind. They
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:10.000]   have an updated springboard. The last update was folders. I mean I guess for iPad you now have the
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.400]   quick look on the left but it's really pretty much not so much changed since the iPhone came out.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:23.440]   >>And meanwhile Android you have multiple third party launchers available to you. You can put
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.920]   live widgets. You could have a live weather forecast on your desktop. This is the one thing
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.080]   that I think has been missing from the iPhone. I hope this is true and I would love to see this
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:39.840]   home screen. >>I think Brian's onto something about the timing of this.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:48.480]   Because you figure it's not likely to come out until the fall. So if they've been probably working
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:55.760]   together typically these acquisitions come after the team has been working together with Apple.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.600]   So probably for the last six months they've been working together and Apple sort of decided you
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.200]   know what we're going to do some really cool stuff with this and we like it so much why don't we
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:11.200]   just buy this. And so that makes a lot of sense. And I agree that the sort of live, I remember the
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.080]   live tiles. That was like the one thing I liked on the Windows phone was I thought it's really
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:22.560]   >>Wasn't that great. I love that. So right now I'm looking at my iPhone home screen. There is one
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:28.480]   icon that's live. It's of course the clock icon and that was relatively recent. It actually shows
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.760]   the time. I've seen many people say, yeah, I wish the weather icon showed weather. Maybe with
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.320]   dark sky now the weather icon should actually show the weather. Oh and yeah, the calendar icon
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:43.760]   shows the day, the date. But that it doesn't really they're not really this is basically a grid of
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.320]   icons. That's not that useful. I'd love to see them do more. >>So you think? >>In 2007.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.480]   >>Yeah, since 2007 a grid of icons. So you think that's why why did they
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:06:00.160]   buy dark sky? >>Aside from the fact that as I said their weather app is terrible and it's been
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.880]   sitting in a crap folder on my iPhone for years now. >>Yeah, that's a good reason.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:10.480]   >>It uses weather channel and weather channel got bought by IBM to keep it. >>Yeah, Watson's
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:16.320]   doing the weather now. >>Right. And they probably don't want to use that. They want to have their own.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.240]   I mean, honestly, the more I think about it, even though to me the biggest shame, I definitely
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:25.600]   understand for Android fans why they would be very upset understandably for the app going away.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:31.120]   For me, the bigger bummer is that the API is going away. However, as we're having this conversation,
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:38.320]   it strikes me that the API is probably the really valuable part of it here because I profiled
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:44.560]   dark sky back in 2013. They've been around for a little over a year at that point. And right after
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.400]   they had kind of announced the API, but I think before anybody had really adopted it. And I thought
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:55.280]   it was so interesting then that that was going to be their business model, you know, was the API.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.480]   And you've seen a ton of apps and services use it and they've had their usage model. But I never
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.120]   have gotten the sense that it's been something that's been like spectacularly profitable for them.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.400]   Like, I think that it's been profitable and they've been able to continue to evolve the app,
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:14.400]   but it hasn't been one of those like runaway, you know, success things, right? So I could see
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.320]   if you're buying this, the app is beautiful and it has good features, but it's really that
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.560]   API that has the power, especially if you could put it into, you know, your home screen, you could,
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.320]   you know, put it on the Apple Watch. You could use it in these places where these third party apps
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.160]   that are using the API are already doing really interesting things. Like you mentioned,
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.480]   carrot weather and there are some other ones that the reason you would want this is so you can get
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:41.280]   that real time information and be able to use it across your devices and platforms. And if it's
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:47.840]   something that other people could use, I mean, it's kind of terrible for the existing people who've
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.520]   been using the API, at least they get a year and a half or so, you know, to wind down and find another
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:08:00.160]   solution. But, you know, it's still, you know, part of me would wish that that would remain open to
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:04.400]   people, but you can also understand why somebody who's buying the company would be like, no, actually,
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.080]   we really like this and this is what we're going to be just using for our own internal purposes.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:16.720]   Just think of it like Siri or Apple Maps, right? It's another one of these things that it's a pillar
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:22.000]   that they feel like they need to have as the future part of it. They want to have deeper
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.920]   integration into the OS. Think about all the things that WeatherTouch and does. Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:33.680]   There's also and I keep trying to stir up this controversy, but nobody's buying. But I think
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.920]   there is a controversy with Weather in general. The most of the services, including dark sky use
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.720]   weather information from the National Weather Service. And that information has been offered as
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.320]   most, by the way, every nation, most nations have national weather services and they offer that
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.080]   its taxpayer paid and they offer that information for free. The National Weather Service, I don't
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.360]   think has an API. So I think what a lot of weather apps do is they take the raw data from the weather
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:08.080]   service and they, their meteorologists then create forecasts out of it. Right.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:13.520]   And you used to have weather underground, which was kind of a, anybody could have their own weather
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.320]   station. And that was kind of a collective of third information. And then IBM bought that
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:24.080]   what like five years ago. Yeah. So there's been to my mind, there's been this and John Oliver did a
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.360]   great piece on it last year. There's something and there's been a move in the federal government.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.120]   There's a there's a group of people that want to start charging for NOAA data.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:42.400]   Trump proposed failed to take the, the founder of Weather, the Weather Channel to have him run
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.120]   the National Weather Service. Fortunately, Congress got one of that and said, yeah, no,
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:52.320]   I don't think so. But there's something going on with weather. And it seems like IBM's making a
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:58.000]   big play to do its own weather service, basically. Basically, yeah, because so Weather Channel bought
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.720]   Weather Underground first, I just Googled and found that out in 2012. And I remember that and the
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.360]   Weather Underground community was apoplectic. And then IBM bought Weather Underground but didn't
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.600]   buy the Weather Channel, but then they bought the Weather Channel. And so IBM is clearly working
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:17.440]   on something. And I'm from, I'm from Atlanta where the Weather Channel, it was based. And I actually,
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.960]   when I was in high school, I was friends with a guy who was at Georgia Tech in grad school who
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:29.920]   was like, meteorologist studying that stuff. And he worked at the Weather Channel for many years.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.880]   And it was really interesting. I mean, this was close to 20 years ago now. But I remember the
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.200]   conversations being very, very interesting about the stuff that they were doing. But you're right,
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.400]   it's an interesting question about how we have the private sector essentially running. And in some
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:50.480]   cases, using the public resources around Weather. But also in some cases, they're creating their own.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:56.960]   Right? That's kind of the rub is that a lot of, they're making investments that the National
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:02.880]   Weather Service might not be. Historically, it was smaller companies, more independence.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.480]   And the Weather Channel has had various ownership structures over the years too.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:13.440]   But I think when you see a giant IBM buy it, that's when you're like, huh, okay, it's very fitting
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.600]   that the Weather Company is a subsidiary of IBM's cloud platform.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:29.520]   Yeah, it's a tangled web. And I just think Apple buying into this is, I mean, it could be very
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.440]   simple. They could say, hey, these engineers are great. It's an aqua hire. They could say, hey,
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.960]   we want a live weather widget on iOS 14. It could be as simple as that. Or it could be Apple has
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:45.360]   aspirations to do something more like Apple Maps with weather. And they see IBM coming in here
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.160]   and saying, well, we're going to do weather. I don't know. Not many people left to buy.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.640]   The question is, are they going to be a barracuda about it?
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.920]   Right. Well, that, that to me, I think is what I'm kind of sort of hopeful for.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.520]   If there's any kind of hope to be had about this for the third party in India companies that use
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:10.720]   dark sky as API is that this might, the fact that now essentially, you know,
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.400]   two giant tech companies own the biggest kind of, you know, input things, you know,
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.200]   weather channel and dark sky, this might be an opportunity for a third party to come in.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:23.120]   And maybe the data won't be as good at first. Maybe it won't, you know, have the same power
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.680]   in the beginning, but this might be an opportunity for a third party or even kind of an organization
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.320]   to step in and say, okay, we're going to create an alternative that others can use.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:37.040]   Let me correct myself. This is such a tangled web. I always get this wrong.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.920]   The, it was the CEO of AccuWeather that Trump had proposed as the
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:48.480]   executive director of NOAA. That was turned down. Apparently, AccuWeather wants to shut down
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.280]   NOAA. It's a very, it's a very complicated thing. There's a lot going on.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.640]   There's a tangled web. There's a story in this journal. There's something
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.480]   needs to like write like a New Yorker style, like big, long form piece on the tangled web of
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.040]   weather services. I'm not even joking. I would read the hell out of that.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.600]   Yeah. It's fast. Who would have thought that that could be so, you know, draconian and, and,
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.040]   yeah, there'd be so much backstabbing and that in weather.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.960]   Well, there's a lot of money in it. If you think about it, I mean, agriculture needs to know,
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:23.280]   especially as it gets to be big agribusiness, it needs to know.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.320]   It's the main thing people watch on local television, weather services.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:34.480]   It's a very popular thing. Here's a company called Climacel, the Climacel CEO. Forget the
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.960]   forecast. Teams use Climacel to reduce daily operating costs and maximize revenue. They have
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:45.840]   a weather API that's used by Uber, Delta, JetBlue, National Grid. The Patriots by Ford, by the
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:52.560]   US Open, by Amazon Web Services. You can imagine, weather prediction is pretty important for a
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.840]   lot of businesses. Well, and then think about the future where you might have climate change
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.480]   becoming a big multi-trillion dollar effect on the economy every single year. Yeah.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.120]   So, no, weather features is a massive industry for so many things.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:16.720]   So, Climacel jumped on this dark sky acquisition and said, "Well, we got an API. We got an API.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:22.560]   So, that's going to be very interesting. My guess is their API won't be free, but I don't know.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.280]   This is their business. They're a Boston company. Climacel.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.600]   Yeah. I think the reason the dark sky was appealing to a lot of people was that their
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:35.680]   terms were their API usage terms were pretty reasonable. Whereas, some of these other services,
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.600]   I'm sure they exist, but aren't going to exist maybe for people who either have a free or
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:47.280]   a 99 cents or a dollar 99 mobile app. So, I think that's the bigger question.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:52.000]   When you presumably have a bunch of calls going to check those things out.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.200]   But it is, look, take advantage of that. Absolutely. Get your name out there.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:03.920]   This is a massive market for climate change for other things and for a bunch of different industries.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:11.440]   IoT is heavily involved in many cases around things like agriculture and weather sensors and data
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:20.080]   around that. So, yeah. Dark sky does charge carrot weather and some of these other small apps
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:26.960]   for the use of the API carrot. Yeah, they charge, but I believe that their fees are fairly reasonable.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.800]   It's pains and goes. So, they don't have to pay more than they can afford, I guess,
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.280]   is the idea. I'm reading a Fast Company article. Carrot weather is the smart alec one, right?
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.360]   Yeah. There's also hello weather and the valor's hello weather says they're prepared to go on
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.640]   without dark sky. They chose dark sky because it was affordable. But he says, I've been scouting
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.880]   other options for a few months now, although they all have their own individual pros and cons.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:04.960]   Yeah, weather, who knew? But you're right with climate change with increased massive storms
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:10.560]   coming out of the Gulf and the Caribbean. All of this has become very important.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.360]   So, it's interesting. So, Brian, you are getting those notifications. This is going to rain in 10
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.320]   minutes, but you said it doesn't work so well for you in Louisville, Jason.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.200]   Oh, no, it worked here too. Oh, you get it? Who wasn't that? Maybe maybe?
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.080]   No, I said it works amazing. It was somebody on Twitter that said it.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.920]   Oh, somebody had Twitter said it. Because if you set it up the right way, and again,
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.720]   New York City, I don't know, but I can be out in Prospect Park with my kids. I'll get a notification
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:41.600]   precipitation starting in 10 minutes. That's enough time to get back to your house and it's
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.160]   sent. You have to hook up to the notifications for your phone. But not only that, if you go into the
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:51.600]   app, it'll show you like a little waveform that says, you know, it's going to start raining in
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.680]   about five minutes. In about 12 minutes, it's going to be medium. In about 20 minutes,
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.680]   it's going to be high. It works for snow. It works for rain. As soon as I, it's sort of like
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.520]   Google was all those years ago. As soon as I got that app, I never had to use anything else. It was
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.840]   perfect. Yeah. And that's the kind of thing you want to know. You want to know, should I,
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:16.480]   can I, should I run home? Is it going to rain? You said that Apple might be a barracuda.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.640]   Is that what you said, Jason? What does that mean? That they're going to eat people up and spit
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:28.480]   them out. I was also, I was also trying to cue you too. I was impressed. Okay. How did you know
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:34.560]   the next ad was for barracuda networks? I intuited it. I also read it on. I also read it on the
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:40.000]   Oh, it is. It was. Yeah. Barracuda. Everybody knows Barracuda. Cloud enabled enterprise grade
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.440]   security solutions. We've used Barracuda for years that protect your network, protect your data,
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:51.520]   your applications, protect your email. Now that so many people are working remotely,
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:59.360]   email is the number one vector for taking over your network and remote employees without the IT
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.840]   support, without somebody to say, Hey, does this look like a phishing email to you? Maybe more
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:09.280]   likely to get you in trouble. They're all getting email every day that makes them vulnerable. And
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:16.080]   as we know, 91% of all cyber attacks start in email spearfishing ransomware account takeover
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:24.480]   conversation hijacking. 91% come through email, multiply that by how many employees, by how many
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:31.680]   emails one all takes one mistake. It'll cost you money, customers, your reputation. And if it's
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:37.120]   ransomware could even shut you down. Barracuda's researchers have seen a steady increase in the
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:44.800]   number of coronavirus related spearfishing attacks. It's so sad. The bad guys are so awful. 667%
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:53.920]   spike in attacks since the end of February, 667%. They want to get in your network. They want to
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:19:00.320]   take over. They want to infect you with ransomware and they're taking advantage of COVID-19. And
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.280]   your employees are home. They're scared. Maybe they're going to click on that email. That's why
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:10.720]   you need Barracuda total email protection. All in one email security backup and archiving.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:16.160]   It's AI based protection from spearfishing from account takeover from business email compromise.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:20.080]   They have an automated incident response that gives you options to quickly and effectively
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:26.560]   address attacks. And they even have training for your employees so that they know, they know what
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.280]   not to do, what not to click. That's really important. Right now there are new attacks of
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:37.760]   personating organizations like the World Health Organization. So easy for an employee to see that.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   By the way, I got a lot of this information. Barracuda has an excellent blog, which you should
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:47.680]   totally check out at barracuda.com. Lots of information there about the threats you're facing.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:55.520]   And then while you're there, go to barracuda.com/twit and take a look at their Office 365 email

[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.840]   really good. And now's the time, man. Don't put this one off.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.080]   So one of the big...
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.160]   Trying to do an O-Doc to move there. That was an O-Doc.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.400]   That was a good O-Doc to. I heard the word Barracuda. My ears pricked up. I said, what?
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.120]   I thought it was a coincidence.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:56.640]   Little did I know how smart Jason Heiner is. Jason Heiner is here. He is
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:02.800]   editorial director at CNET. So good to have Jason. Long time friend at Jason Heiner on Twitter.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:08.240]   Also, it's wonderful that Brian McCullough, the tech meme ride home. I don't ride with him
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.560]   anymore, but I do listen every day. And I am going to listen to that new COVID morning report.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.760]   That sounds great.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:20.880]   At coronavirus morning report. Yes. Coronavirus, pardon me. At Brian MCC on the Twitter. And of
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:28.080]   course, from Microsoft, she's a developer advocate, senior cloud advocate, Christina Warren. Great
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:34.160]   to have film girl here. Nice. I feel like I'm just hanging with friends. This is nice. I really
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:41.360]   appreciate it. And congrats on 15. I mean, the last one really fast. I remember 10 at the brick house.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.480]   Yeah. I was just there. Cupcakes. Yeah, cupcakes. I was just there.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:52.160]   Reporting because I was working on my book at the time. And so I can't.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:55.840]   You believe that's been five years ago? I know. I know. Crazy.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.480]   Yeah. I still have. I have my shirt that you sent me. You're kind of
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.920]   sending me a 10 year anniversary shirt because I wasn't able to be there in person.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.400]   Yeah. That's not. That's not. I still have that shirt. That's crazy.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.360]   I'm going to try to get to 20 and then it's all bets are off. I don't know.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.400]   You know, saying I've been doing this for 20 years, that's saying a lot. That's pretty cool.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:19.280]   I'm happy to be doing it for 15. We are going to don't expect any shirts or cupcakes this year.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:26.960]   We decided to donate the money we would spend for the celebration to relief to our medical and
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:30.720]   first responders in the area. That's awesome. Give them. Yeah. Good job.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.480]   That's awesome. A little help. So I think that's better to spend the money on right now than
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:41.040]   absolutely. Caleo shouldn't eat anyway. Are you are you are you cooking more at home guys? Are
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.880]   you doing more? I did a terrible thing last night. A listener sent me his grandma's chocolate cake
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:56.880]   recipe and I made it and then I ate Lisa. I are groaning. Why did we do that? No more chocolate
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:03.680]   cake was so good. I couldn't stop eating it. I don't cook at all. So no, it's been hard.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.800]   Well, I mean, doing a lot of like, you know, take out delivery from places that are still doing it,
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.920]   tipping, you know, like, you know, 50% sometimes, you know, as much as we can to help. And then there
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:19.200]   are like, like in microwave things or whatever. But I don't, I don't cook. So it's been a challenge
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:26.240]   to be totally honest because yeah, it's an opportunity to learn to cook. This is a chance.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:31.280]   You don't want to do that. You don't want to be that woman. You don't want to feel it.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:36.720]   Yeah. No, people keep saying that. I'm like, yeah, but see, I've never learned for a reason. Like,
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:44.800]   it's just a song I bring home the bacon, fried up in a pan, never ever let you forget your man
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:52.400]   because I'm a woman. You don't remember that. No, you don't live that. No, uh, uh, that was
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:59.600]   from the old days. That was the, that was the most sexist, horrible ad ever. But I, it's in my mind.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.640]   You can't get, you can't get rid of it. I like to cook. I love to cook it, but I got to stop
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.640]   baking because that's a bad habit. Bad habit. I do like to bake that that I do enjoy, but uh,
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.480]   yeah, I haven't done that either. Not yet. No, don't get started. Everybody's making sourdough.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.640]   It's a funny thing. That was going to say everyone, everyone's making bread. I'm like, okay,
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.200]   I don't have patience for that. There's no yeast available. There's no sugar available.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.880]   That's why you have to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.000]   But yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just find something for your starter or whatever. Yeah. I was
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.520]   going to say, uh, yeah, I see that all over my Twitter and I'm like, that's great. Don't have
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:43.360]   the time of the patience for this. Animal crossing is enough right now. So if you make a starter,
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.520]   apparently the thing is to name it. The New York Times, uh, cooking, uh, columnist has named her
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:54.880]   starter yeast witherspoon. That's good. Yeah. I thought that was pretty funny.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.120]   All right. Let's get back to the tech news. That was a little break. A little break from the tech news.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:07.760]   Um, this actually in the, we're going to get heavy again, but the intercept and others have
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:16.880]   had lots of articles about the threat per proposed, posed now by the fact that we're all trying to,
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:25.920]   you know, beat this virus. And so we're looking at location apps, uh, and using location information
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:33.280]   to fight it, which is, of course, a good idea. And yet there's always this risk that when you do that,
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:41.440]   um, you open a Pandora's box. I mean, let's not forget that it was after 9/11 that the Patriot
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.960]   Act was passed that gave the government unprecedented powers to snoop on us. And, uh, is it still in
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:54.640]   effect? Oh yeah. Almost 20 years later, it's still in effect. So emergency powers that are still,
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:01.360]   mm hmm. Yeah. Um, I, I'm going to see if I can find that article by Sam Biddle in the intercept,
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.920]   because it might be in the rundown, but I can't say I got the link if, um,
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:11.120]   Do you send that's right? Uh, you can read from it or talk about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the point
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:17.200]   that I took away from it was this is Mohammed, uh, Taejah, or I, you know, however that's pronounced,
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:24.240]   uh, but he's with the ACLU of Southern California. His point was that it, you could have data driven
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:31.680]   approaches to, uh, tracking the pandemic, but what would be a good idea is to, before you start
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:38.400]   doing it, have limits built in place. Yes. And then require justifications every step of the way so
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:44.480]   that, all right, here are the parameters for how we will use data from Facebook. We will use data
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:50.000]   from Google and your cell phone and all that stuff. But every time you go beyond parameter one,
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.640]   just parameter two to parameter three, you have to justify it in the same way that, you know,
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:59.760]   uh, the police have to go to a court and justify, you know, increased surveillance and things like
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.960]   that. Is londog singing a chat room? Never let a good crisis go to waste. Here's, here's our
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:11.680]   opportunity. South Korea, Taiwan and Israel, they're using smartphone location data to enforce
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:18.000]   quarantines of individuals. Moscow police say they've already busted 200 quarantine violators
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.640]   caught via face recognition enabled cameras. NSA contractor, uh, Palantir is helping Britain's
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:31.200]   National Health Service track infections, apps that leverage a smartphone's bounty of built in
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.640]   highly accurate sensors to enforce social distancing or map the movements of the infected have been
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:45.600]   deployed in Singapore, Poland, Kenya, uh, in Mexico, Uber sent government authorities, rider data,
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:52.640]   apparently they had a infected tourist. Uh, and then the person who took the drove the tourists,
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:58.720]   they tracked all 240 dry users who had taken a ride with that driver so that the Mexican
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:04.160]   authorities could notify them all. You may have been exposed, self quarantine. All of this sounds
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:10.560]   good, but it does highlight how much location information we're all giving up all the time.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:17.360]   And then the this week, the stories that were coming out that in the US, the municipalities
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.400]   that are using it that have started to use it in recent weeks, the reason that they're able to use
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:28.720]   it is because they're going to the ad companies and the ad brokers because there's no laws in place
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.680]   for what they can and cannot do with them. So much information. And so that data is just sitting
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:37.840]   there. So you're starting to get municipalities going to them because they're in the business of
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.720]   selling that data anyway. Yeah. And as Bob says in our chat room, I'd opt in attracting for public
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:49.280]   health in a heartbeat. That's a good. This is a great benefit and maybe could help us end this
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:54.400]   quarantine faster and do it more effectively, right? And after quarantine, we've got to think about,
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.200]   well, how are you know, it's the virus is still going to be out there and potent for at least
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:05.120]   another year and a half. Until we get a vaccine, how do we track infections and shut them down so
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:10.160]   that we don't have to all go into quarantine? All of this can be enabled by this kind of location
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:14.480]   information. Here's some of the apps, some of the apps that are already doing it in those other
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:21.360]   countries. Again, it's a thing where you know, you turn on Bluetooth, let's say everyone has an app.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:28.960]   We agree to it, we say for the course of this pandemic, I will turn on the coronavirus test
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.240]   and trace app, right? And then it would run over Bluetooth so that it would keep track of other
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.840]   phones that you come into contact with within say six feet or whatever. So that then if you are
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:46.560]   tested and you come down with it, then they all then and only then and that gets into the point of
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:52.960]   having these guardrails in place, then they could go and see, well, Leo was within six feet of these
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:58.000]   72 people over the last week. And so let's go test them. I think it's a good sense. Yeah. Yes.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:05.120]   But I understand also the concern. These are the suggestion Sam makes in his article.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:10.960]   Health officials must drive data decisions. It can't come from government. Oh, we think this is a
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:15.360]   good idea. It should come from health officials trying to do the right thing for health.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:20.640]   Corona virus related surveillance must be clearly justified against the costs.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:29.440]   Data collected should expire. There shouldn't be just, oh, hey, we got all this data. Let's keep
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:34.720]   it. And it should be walled off. It should be treated like the US Census is currently treated as
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:42.720]   privileged information not to be used by other agencies, not to be used to arrest people or to
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:51.360]   find undocumented immigrants, things like that. I think these are absolutely good points raised.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:57.600]   And normally the intercept is maybe a little bit more to the left, left cleaning than I like.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.960]   But I think in this case, I think these are things we have to really pay attention to.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:09.280]   I think the core point from Mohammed Taj-Sar from the ACLU there is really critical. It's just that
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:15.520]   governments tend to make these requests with it. It's just kind of like, oh, let's just take that
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:22.080]   data. And once they acquire the data, then it becomes privileged government information
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:25.920]   where all of a sudden somebody else wants to use that data for something else. And they're like,
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.840]   oh, we've got that data. We can go look at that to figure this out. And it's like, no, no,
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.960]   that's not what nobody's there to say. Oh, no, that wasn't what we originally got that data for.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:39.520]   They just now look at it as like, oh, we now have the access to this. So we're going to use it for
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:45.040]   all these other things that we might want to use it for. And that's the key thing to make sure
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.240]   does not happen in something like this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that that's my big concern is that
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:55.680]   just history is we're not as we're all kind of discussing that any time you ever give any
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.560]   institution, government or otherwise, additional access. And it's just for a short period of time,
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:09.600]   like they don't like to give that access back. And as trying and as you know, we're all in panic
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:13.120]   and these are like extraordinary times and they cause for extraordinary measures that has to be
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.800]   balanced with we can't give up our civil liberties and some of the core parts of what makes America
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.760]   America simply because we're in this time because we will as the Patriot Act. It's a great example.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:29.680]   We will never get those powers back. And, you know, we have to look at what are the opportunities
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:33.200]   to do this without within the systems that we have in place because there are opportunities.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:38.080]   It might be easier if certain things are suspended, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible. So,
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:43.520]   you know, I think I'm going to err on the side of civil liberties every day of the week,
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:48.560]   similar to the few weeks back in the reports of them wanting to do, you know, some tracking
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:52.800]   about, you know, where people's activities are to try to aid in, you know, stopping the spread.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:58.720]   And it's like, that's a great idea. I don't want the government being aided by Facebook or Google
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:04.800]   or anybody else tracking my location, no matter what they say the reason is. Like, I don't want that,
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:12.080]   you know? Google released that thing this week where they're showing and it's completely
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:18.880]   anonymized and all that stuff, but showing the amount of visits to parks and things like that and
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:25.840]   groups and things. I mean, the problem is this is a, I agree with everything that everyone has said
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:30.880]   in terms of the civil liberties concern, the government power concerns, but at the same time,
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:36.960]   in the same way that, you know, in 1919 or whenever the Spanish flu thing happened,
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:42.080]   they didn't even understand fully things like antibiotics and vaccines and stuff.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:49.200]   We have the advantage right now of if the problem is tracking, testing and tracing
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:54.240]   and tracking contacts with people, we happen to have the perfect tool because everyone is
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:34:00.320]   carrying around supercomputers in their pockets so that there has to be some way to take advantage
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:05.040]   of the fact that for the first time in human history, we have the perfect tools in everybody's
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:11.120]   pocket to stop an epidemic, to trace an epidemic, that there has to be some way to do it
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:18.080]   and not let this perfect tool go to waste. And I agree with all the concerns, but at the same time,
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.680]   it's like your house is on fire and you're standing there with a bucket of water.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.800]   I don't want to use it. I'm wanting to drink it sometime. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:33.200]   I don't know. I mean, I agree with what you're saying, but if that were true and I think we
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.800]   have these ways to track people. I mean, when we look at the countries that have responded and
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.040]   have managed to, you know, contain things the right way, they haven't gone that far into that level
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:47.040]   of surveillance. Now they have other Singapore, Singapore has, and there's a couple of other South
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.200]   Korea. I don't know if they're using, but I believe Singapore has one of those apps that
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:56.400]   something like 600,000 people have downloaded. Again, sorry, it's because I've been doing a
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:02.160]   podcast on this every day for three weeks, but you're an expert. Yeah. The counterbalance is no
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.960]   way. I'm not an expert. I just read all the things. The counterbalance is there's another country
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.920]   who's the identity eludes me right now that Dave encouraged. I think it's one of the
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.760]   countries in the Middle East. They created their own app, encouraged all of their population to
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:19.440]   download it. And when security researchers looked at it, it was one of those apps where it's like,
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:23.760]   Oh, yeah. Also, it's going to grab all of your messages, all of your photos and everything.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:30.320]   This is my point is that even Singapore, it's not a requirement right now. If I know exactly
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:34.800]   what's true, that's true. That's true. I would also, I would also posit that the Singapore government
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.760]   is very different from the US government in terms of there are a lot of reasons why they've been
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.400]   more ahead of this than we have. And one of them is that it's strictly a place where people listen
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:49.920]   to the government and follow rules more. And because they know that the government will take action,
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.560]   it's very different from our country. But I guess my point was going to be even those places that
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:36:00.720]   have done this, it hasn't been like it's become kind of like a requirements. So I look and I'm like,
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:06.240]   is this necessary right now? Because I would argue that part of the reason that Singapore
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.640]   has been so much better at it has nothing to do with the app. It has everything to do with
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:16.160]   their system of government, which definitely- Well, let me do one more real quick,
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.800]   devil's advocate for you. Because Leon and I were talking about this before we started recording,
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:26.560]   which is, all right, if we want to buy the summer, get people back to work, some people back to work.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:31.360]   Leon and I were talking about the second half of it, which is in theory, if people
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:36.080]   contract the disease and recover from it, they might be immune for a period of time. So those
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.400]   people can start to go back to work. But all of us sitting at home that haven't contracted it,
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:46.000]   to send people back out into the workforce, you're going to need some sort of a situation
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.960]   where you can monitor those people. So what if it was a situation where they said,
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:56.240]   Christina, you can come back into the office as long as you download this app. Maybe it's done
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.960]   through Microsoft or whatever. So there's layers of protection. But it's like some sort of a situation
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:08.400]   where if in the office an outbreak happens or someone in July comes down with it after people
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:12.880]   have cautiously gone back to work, well, then we can immediately lock down that section of
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:18.240]   Microsoft and allow the rest of Microsoft to continue working. I'm just saying that there has to be
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:26.800]   some way once the sheltering in place regime hopefully ends sometime soon. Because inevitably,
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:31.680]   there's going to be flare ups again. And so there has to be some way to set up a system
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:37.040]   to immediately seal off a leaking ship. Those areas where flare ups occur.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:42.320]   I don't disagree with that. I think my response to that would be that I'm in favor of that. But
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:48.080]   I would wonder if the better response isn't an app, but getting widespread testing and getting
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:53.760]   widespread antibody testing. This is what I'm saying. It's all part and parcel. It's a combination
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:58.960]   of things because even in a best case scenario, and this would be a best case scenario that some
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:05.200]   small percentage of the population gets it as opposed to 70%. The idea of people going back to work
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:11.280]   has to be I want to be safe. I'm not willing to go back to work until you can start to give me
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:17.040]   assurances that in your we work or whatever, if that wing of the we work, someone had a
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:23.920]   got reinfected or something like that. That you could know that within hours, you could begin to
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:30.000]   like send people home within hours. So I'm saying that again, there are tools that we have today that
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.560]   we've never had before that would allow some of us and some large portion of us to start to get
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:42.400]   back to life as normal. But that also includes non-technical things like maybe we need to have
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.320]   people outside of every office just testing temperatures and things like that.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.440]   Right. I would just say that I guess my fear is that we're immediately going to this place if
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.240]   using surveillance and technology to try to contain this when we aren't even doing in the United States
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:01.200]   that the basic things that we need to do, which is testing. Until you have widespread testing and
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.800]   testing over and over again. So it's not just one of those things where you've been tested once,
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.440]   but testing people repeatedly. And we don't have that we don't have that infrastructure. Like to me,
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.120]   that's that makes more sense. And if you want to use technology to aid with getting people
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:20.800]   tests, I'm all about that. But I'm concerned about some of these other reaches just because I
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:26.080]   think you give access to that information, you're never going to get it back ever. And it's like
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:33.040]   the dark night. It's like he made him, he made him Lucius destroy the tool because it was too
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.720]   powerful. It's that same sort of thing. Like once you have that, I don't care how caring
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.440]   how good the intentions are of any company or government, they're not going to give up
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:49.200]   that access. They're just not. It's interesting too that in all of this,
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.880]   we're starting to understand a little bit better how companies are tracking us and keeping that
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.240]   information. There's a company called Unicast that's business is selling location information,
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.520]   which they collect from a variety of apps and so forth. They've actually made a social distancing
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:12.400]   scoreboard. They know so much about people's locations that you can actually go look and see
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:18.080]   how your county is doing. Let's see how New York is doing in social distancing. New York County,
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:24.400]   New York. Oh, good. You guys are doing well. A minus. I don't know. Look out my window right now.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.480]   You see a lot of people out there. Well, apparently,
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.560]   you got to look up King County. King's County would be without a New York County. That's
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:34.960]   Manhattan. King's County looks like a minus too. So that's good. It doesn't help that I'm a block
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:39.440]   away from the park too. So people are still heading out for their run. Here's a point. Let me give
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:45.040]   you a minus as well. But let me show you, by the way, you would think, Oh, out here in the country,
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.440]   we're probably doing really well. We're a C minus. You guys are doing a better job
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:54.800]   in reducing. Can I give you one more argument about using data? So this is interesting though.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.400]   I guess that's my point is we're now learning a little more about how much
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.720]   unicast knows that's a valuable and interesting map. But at the same time,
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:08.320]   unicast, wow, who knew these guys knew all this stuff? We should think it's fine. You already
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:14.560]   have this information. I'm what I would get it. Well, well, the same way that they get other
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:20.080]   things. Yeah, probably probably services on your cell phone. What I'm opposed to is having
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.080]   more information that we're not already giving. Like that, that's what I'm opposed to is giving
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:27.760]   more access. Right. Are you guys aware of the Kinsa smart
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.080]   I use it. I love the Kinsa. Yeah. So you've seen their maps as well. Yeah.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:37.440]   The health of the health weather. Right. That's data that we didn't know that they were keeping.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:43.120]   No, we did. No, I did. No, that's not true. Kinsa's been handing out these thermometers. They have
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.920]   over a million of them out there to schools for precisely this purpose. It's anonymized data.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:53.120]   There's no way of knowing which thermometer is owned by anybody. But before COVID, it was about
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:59.600]   flu, but it's very valuable information. So we'll see here it even says influenza like illness
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:05.440]   near you. You can see what's typical atypical trends. So you can see where the hot spots are
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:09.280]   and observed. And this is based on thermometers they've been handing out. I actually went out
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:13.440]   and bought one part partly because I wanted to take my temperature with a Bluetooth enabled
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:18.880]   thermometer every day. But also I'm glad to help. In fact, they've tied into the University of
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.840]   California at San Francisco. So every day, I think it's UCF's. No, where are they tied in with?
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:30.880]   I can't remember. Is it UCSF? Say again, ora. That's right. My ring is tied with them with UC.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.280]   This also is measuring my temperature. I have temperature measurements all over the place.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.320]   But this is kind of cool. So I actually have a timeline of my temperatures. Now, you know,
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:48.080]   unfortunately, unlike influenza, there's COVID has a lot of asymptomatic cases. We don't know how many,
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.920]   but you know, this is some valuable information as well. And you can even see how we get a better
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.400]   report card here if I looked at Sonoma County, because we have flattened the curve, at least
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:05.280]   according to temperature readouts. If I look at the graph here, this is normal for this time of
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:11.600]   year with influenza and we're well below that, well below normal because of, I think,
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.240]   because it shows your distancing. Nobody's getting the flu or. Oh, there's tons of data about that.
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:21.520]   How, of course, not only is the normal flu down because nobody's out spreading it,
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.960]   you know, car accidents are down. There's a whole, but like the overall normal death rate crime
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:33.840]   in New York is way. Yes. Also, the air is clear. The fish, the fish have returned to the Bellagio
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:41.840]   fountain. Everything is better when people stay home. Gas prices are at historic lows.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:47.520]   Anyway, yeah, this one, I don't have a problem with Kinsa because a when you get it, they say this
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.360]   is what's going to happen. The data is anonymized. There's no way of knowing it's your thermometer.
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:56.400]   And B this they've been doing this for years. This is a, this is actually very interesting.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:04.640]   Public health effort from Kinsa. So hey, if you, if you know, cobalt, good news,
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:11.680]   New Jersey wants to hire you. Apparently the New Jersey financial assistance software runs on
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:20.080]   a car. This is from the register, of course, creaking main frames. And Governor Phil Murphy is looking
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:28.080]   for people who know cobalt because he called it cobalt computer skills because that's what we're
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:35.520]   dealing with in these legacies. We have systems that are 40 plus years old. There'll be lots of
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:40.080]   post mortems. One of them on our list will be how the heck did we get here where we literally need
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.520]   cobalt programmers.
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:49.120]   This is really funny. You know, you, you mentioned Leo that I used to work with in enterprise,
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:55.440]   with tech republic. And I remember in 2001, we did this story. It was in our most popular
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.720]   stories of the year was like the hottest skill of 2001. And it was almost, this was almost like a
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:09.600]   joke. Was cobalt programming because they were all these old government systems that had, you know,
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:15.760]   modernized. And so there weren't enough people that still knew the language to actually keep
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:22.240]   them running. And they had no plans to, you know, make them obsolete and move them to new systems.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:30.320]   This is in 2001. And we don't think it was like this. Yo, right? Yeah. No, it's so funny. My late
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:37.600]   aunt, she was an engineer at CSX. And she was in very, very high demand in around the year 2000
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:42.080]   because she knew cobalt and they were having to fix all those systems. And I think that she did
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:47.200]   ultimately, I think she moved to Java, but she was still, I mean, you're exactly right, Jason,
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:52.320]   like we've had 20 years ago, we were having this conversation about we've got to like update
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:57.920]   these systems and just nope. If you know cobalt, there's always going to be a place for you, I
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:03.040]   think is the lesson. It's kind of amazing. But you know, I mean, honestly, I understand.
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.360]   If it works, why are you working? And that's what that yeah. And you know, you don't want
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:11.600]   some hot shot consultant to come in and say, all you need is four IBM PCs and you can replace
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:17.440]   that mainframe. I don't know. There are a lot of these systems like this in government. And it's
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:23.680]   not just cobalt or some other these outdated systems that it would cost, in some cases, often
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:29.680]   hundreds of thousands of dollars to upgrade to get the same capabilities that they already have.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:34.960]   Nothing new, no added features, no anything that's hard to sell, isn't it? Hundreds of thousands
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:41.200]   of dollars to just get the exact same stuff on modern architecture. And the problem is you're
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.920]   almost never going to justify. Yeah, and the problem is even if you did get it exactly the same,
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.800]   there are sometimes like there are bugs maybe that were written around in that program that if
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.760]   you then modernize it, go away. And like what are the repercussions there? I mean, I can totally
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:00.720]   understand why four places that have budgets where they wouldn't want to pay hundreds of thousands
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:05.280]   of dollars to get the exact same thing, which from their perspective, it's like, well, it's working
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:11.280]   why do this? But also from the perspective, you don't know what the potential ramifications are
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:16.880]   of making this upgrade. I think in general, it's probably a good idea to try to, at a certain
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:21.520]   point, assess your legacy systems and look at how do we modernize the whole thing. And you can
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.880]   amortize the cost more easily. But it's certainly not one of those things where a lot of people
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:32.000]   are going to have that budget to do it. And I can see why I would keep getting pushed to the side
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:37.520]   every single year. Okay, we could spend a few hundred thousand dollars doing this or updating
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:44.080]   something. Yeah, it's like the, there was a school district that's entire HVAC system is running
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:51.440]   on an Amiga. Yes, yes, exactly. I love that. But there's what there are things you
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:55.600]   see to where things are running on OS2 and you're like, okay, there's a certain point where some
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:01.200]   of the OS, if I'm like, okay, we might not be able to find this hardware ever again. And like,
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:06.720]   you worry about that and maybe you can't virtualize it in a way that would work. But that aside,
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:13.120]   if it's something like a programming language, as long as hopefully there will be people who still
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:18.000]   know COOL or learning it just for the fun of it. I mean, hey, look, we're all inside.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.040]   Good opportunity, right? Just let's just learn some COOL. Maybe I'll do that. Maybe that'll be
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:30.000]   my coronavirus project. Grand Rapids, Michigan public school system. This story from 2015,
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:36.800]   they're still running their entire HVAC on this little Amiga in a closet,
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:42.800]   closet somewhere. You know what? It fits the job. It fits the purpose. That's pretty funny,
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.360]   though, I have to say. Hey, let's take a little break when we come back. Lots more to talk about
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:52.240]   one more thing I should mention. If we're going to mention COOL Ball, let's not forget who wrote
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:49:00.720]   COOL Ball, the late Admiral Grace Hopper, one of the great computer programmers of our time,
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:07.040]   and a woman. And the woman who also was the first person to use the word bug in relationship
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:14.160]   to a computer program. Our show today brought to you by ExtraHop, another new sponsor,
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.840]   but a one that everybody's going to want to know about because as we're starting to
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:25.680]   work from home, if everything moves up into the cloud, you need to protect yourself. ExtraHop
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:34.560]   is a threat monitoring system that keeps an eye on your business, on your cloud, and helps you

[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:54.000]   of information you really need to know. You've got people working at home. You've got data in the
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.920]   cloud. You've probably got some stuff on prem at the office. It's all over the place, but on

[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:36.880]   cloud with ExtraHop. Their chief architect, Dan McDaniel, I have a quote from, "There is no other
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:43.680]   company that aligns to supporting the DevOps model, the speed, and the lack of friction than ExtraHop."
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:50.720]   That's because ExtraHop comes from that culture. The Home Depot uses ExtraHop to manage and secure
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:57.120]   nearly 2,300 remote sites. Yes, the point of sale, absolutely. They say no dataset is more
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:02.560]   complete and accurate than what ExtraHop delivers. No matter how complex your network, no matter how
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:12.080]   hybrid, no matter where your employees, your cash registers, your devices are. ExtraHop gives you

[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:36.320]   White papers and other valuable stuff on securing and supporting remote access because that's
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:42.000]   one of the things we're all dealing with right now. Cloud native network detection and response.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:49.600]   ExtraHop. Love these guys. ExtraHop.com/twit. We welcome to the Twit family. I think this is
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:55.440]   their first ad on the network. Good job, ExtraHop. This is the time for you. This is the time to
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:04.160]   check it out, extrahop.com/twit. Speaking of the cloud, let's talk a little bit about Amazon.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:10.400]   Remember, they said they were going to hire 100,000 new employees. They are already hired 80,000
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:17.200]   workers, including a member of our Twit family. Let me hide his name here because I don't want
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.360]   him to get in trouble. He said, "I'm actually working at Amazon warehouse at the moment." He
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:26.720]   posted this in our Twit community forums. With our business closed, next time I noticed Amazon
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:31.520]   is advertising for jobs like crazy, I always wanted to see how the warehouse is working if
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:37.520]   they're as bad as the news suggests. I applied for a temporary part-time position. He says,
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:42.720]   "There are lots of things in place to keep the warehouse workers safe. They have to keep two
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:47.360]   meters apart everywhere. Lots of cleaning of handles, doors, tables in the canteen.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:53.040]   Cleaning the scanner and arm computer." That's the thing you wear on your arm as you're doing the
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:59.520]   pick. Only one person per table in the canteen, shift times are staggered to stop everyone arriving
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:04.080]   at the same time. When I signed in this morning to my scanner, I was asking questions about
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:10.320]   from Amazon about if the safety measures were being obeyed and that we were made and helped to
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:14.720]   keep two meters apart, which I felt good about. There are a few little gaps. It's actually
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:22.240]   worth reading the whole post. I really appreciate the post. He mentioned that the sign-in pen was
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:28.320]   being shared and then he updated it a couple of days ago. It says, "No more sharing the sign-in pen.
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:33.760]   Somebody scans us in and out from a distance now." They don't have to sign in anymore with a manual
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:40.640]   pen. I think that's good news. Amazon workers, though, did go on a strike. You may remember this,
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:45.760]   and you probably saw the story, a shocking story, that the guy who led the strike,
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:53.680]   Chris Smalls, was fired. Amazon said, "Oh, no, we fired him because he violated quarantine rules."
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:54:02.720]   Kind of convenient. Then you might have seen the internal notes at Amazon. A lawyer was taking at
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:14.400]   a meeting suggesting how they could use PR by calling the guy "Domin." It's a
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:19.120]   not-it does not reflect well on Amazon. Let's put it back. No. Inarticulate was the word.
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:26.000]   Inarticulate. Oh, God. That's such a dog whistle in such a terrible way. Amazon's culture,
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.760]   from what I understand, is very right-heavy, where people write things a lot. They take notes a lot.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:39.840]   It's very driven by writing and communications. It's interesting to me that this is one of the
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.360]   first times that I can recall that we've seen a leak of these sorts of meeting notes released
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:52.400]   in the public like this. To your point, it does not reflect well at all, no matter.
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:59.680]   And Jason Delray also had a leak of, I think it was yesterday, some internal Amazon messaging
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:06.320]   between employees, them saying, "If this is the sort of stuff that leadership is doing,
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:12.240]   what are we even doing here?" I agree with you, Christina. It's the first time that I've seen,
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:16.880]   we've seen this happen in other big tech companies, but it's the first time we've started to see leaks
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:24.960]   from the Amazon rank and file and faithful that are like, we do not approve of what is being done
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:32.160]   in our name here. Vice Scott leaked meeting notes from Amazon's general counsel, David Zapolsky,
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:37.120]   saying, talking about Chris Smalls, "He's not smart or articulate, and to the extent the
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:44.080]   press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.320]   explaining for the M-Team's time how we're trying to protect workers if we just put him up in front
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:55.280]   of the microphone. Let them talk to him." The PR strategy is to make Smalls the face of the
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:59.680]   entire union organizing movement because he's not smart or articulate.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:07.440]   Admittedly, it's a private meeting. People might write things they would never say out loud,
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:18.000]   but two geez. No, absolutely, but no, I mean... Zapolsky,
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.560]   an estateant device said, "My comments were personal and emotional. I was frustrated and upset that
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:28.240]   an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of the other Amazonians. I let my
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:35.040]   emotions draft my words and get the better of me." On the other hand, he was also a union organizer,
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.840]   not a union organizer, but an organizer, and organized a strike. Instacart says the
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:45.600]   strike against Instacart on Monday didn't hurt their business at all. Instacart,
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:53.120]   the pickers and delivery folks for Instacart were saying, "We need hazard pay. We need face masks.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.680]   We need wipes. Maybe it didn't hurt their business, but Instacart, by the end of the week,
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:04.640]   had provided additional pay and the materials that the workers wanted." Sometimes these things
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:13.280]   get the job done. It's a tough time, and it's tough for everybody who's out of work. We're with you.
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:19.600]   You have my deepest sympathy. This is the time when the cracks and the inequalities in the American
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:24.400]   economic system rear their ugly head because so many people, so many people I know,
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:31.760]   are no longer working in restaurants or salons or service businesses. They're home travel agents.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:38.400]   It's a difficult time right now, and I don't know what the answer is.
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:46.800]   South by Southwest was called off in Austin. Amazon is going to show a virtual film festival
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:54.080]   for the films that didn't get shown at South by Southwest. It'll be a virtual film festival on
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:59.920]   Amazon Prime. I think that's kind of fun. People are watching a lot more TV than they used to.
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:04.640]   I think this is great. They were notified and given a chance to opt in,
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:11.680]   it'll be a 10-day run sometime later this month. According to a South by Press release,
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:17.680]   the festival will be free to US audiences on Amazon Prime Video. You do not have to be a prime
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:23.440]   member. You'll just have to have a free Amazon account. The filmmakers will be paid a screening
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:30.960]   fee even though you won't be paying anything. Nice. I like that. Honestly, it's nice that
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:37.040]   it's free, but I'm hoping that for some of the other film festivals, Tribeca, there are some other
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:43.920]   ones coming up that they will embrace the full virtual thing. Tribeca has done that to a certain
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.680]   extent over the years, but not for the whole slate because there are plenty of people like me
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:56.080]   who will pay. I'd be happy to pay what a cost of a pass would be to enjoy those things online,
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:00.880]   to still support the filmmakers. I don't need it to be free just because it's online streaming.
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:07.440]   That's not a concern. I'd be happy to support their work. I hope that other film festivals,
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:12.400]   as they start to explore, being online, you can charge for this stuff. It's great if Amazon
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:15.680]   wants to step up and do a partnership and it's still going to give the filmmakers a fee.
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:21.040]   You can still charge for these things. The audience of people who go to film festivals
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:26.240]   and to see movies, most of us, I think we genuinely want to support the arts.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:31.440]   Just because we can't go outdoors doesn't mean that we're not still willing to pay for that.
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:38.640]   Certainly, we're watching a lot more TV. I walked downtown yesterday. I walked by the movie
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:43.280]   theater, which of course is shuttered. It was kind of sad to see all these posters.
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:48.080]   They have the display boxes all the way around the theater for movies that will never open
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:53.280]   in the theaters, but now are being shown streaming for 20 bucks to rent.
[01:59:53.280 --> 02:00:00.800]   I don't know. Is that a reasonable thing for a film company to do? We're not going to be able to
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:06.400]   release the Trolls World Tour. Let's offer it for rent at 20 bucks. It's still cheaper than the
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:11.920]   ticket price. I think so. I think so. I think there's a big question to be asked about,
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:17.680]   because I worry very much about the future of distributors after all. This is over, meaning
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:21.520]   it were exhibitors. Sorry. We're about to be.
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:27.360]   But exhibitors, I worry about absolutely. Their margins are already thin. They've already been
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:33.040]   pushed. They're already getting less percentage on the stews than they used to. They have rents.
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.600]   They have employees. My fear genuinely is that if you get rid of the exhibitors,
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:43.280]   a big portion of the entire economy around Hollywood goes away that I don't think people are quite
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:48.080]   ready to embrace. I don't think everyone thinks, oh, well, we can just go online, not realizing
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:53.600]   that there's a whole long tail that's involved in that where, yes, Netflix spends $15 billion a
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:58.960]   year on entertainment, but that's still a fraction of what the global box office is.
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:04.960]   I worry very much about the exhibitors. Having said that, I do think that in times like this,
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:10.480]   for certain films, it certainly makes sense to say is $20 for a rental, because to your point,
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:16.960]   if you're a family and that's trolls too, that's going to be the audience, $20 is going to be less
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:23.760]   than the price of everybody going out and getting tickets. So, if you need kind of
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:31.040]   distraction or whatnot, that's a good way to do it. But at the same time, I think, I don't know
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:35.200]   how successful it will be for other types of films, because there are certain audiences who will pay
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:39.600]   $20 for the rental, and then there are certain audiences who won't, because they will just say,
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:44.800]   well, I'm just going to wait for it to either come out so I can buy it or come to one of the
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:50.880]   services that I subscribe to. So, I think that's what we're going to figure out, what actual,
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:56.640]   I guess, demand is of people willing to do that, because they've done day and date releases. I
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:02.000]   think Steven Soderbergh first did a day and date release with Bubble in 2006, and I think that was
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.120]   with video on demand on Comcast and some of the other cable providers. So, this has been something
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:12.000]   we've been doing for almost 15 years. What is going to happen? Not that anybody cares.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.920]   The economy awards have become such a joke, but I guess it's still important. What's going to
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:21.040]   happen this year in the Academy Awards? Some of these movies will never be exhibited in the theaters.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:23.440]   Yeah, it does. According to their rules, you have to exhibit in the theater.
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:29.680]   Right. I was going to say they're going to have to. They're going to have to.
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:33.760]   They're going to have to. Independent movie theaters are looking at new ways to make money
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:40.800]   during this shutdown. There's an independent chain in Los Angeles. Alamo Draft House, one of
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:47.280]   my favorite independent theaters, Film Forum and Angelica are trying out, Angelica is that how
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:53.680]   you pronounce it, are trying out streaming, even though the risk is you stream these movies.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:59.920]   And maybe people say, "Hey, this is pretty good experience. I guess I don't have to go to the Alamo
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:05.120]   Draft House anymore." I don't think that I think once this is over, especially, people are going to
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:09.600]   be so stir crazy from having been in. We're going to flock to the theaters. People are going to
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:13.760]   love the chance to get out. And that's why theaters have always been. And to be fair,
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:19.120]   the theaters over the last few years have been really smart. They've started doing more food
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:23.440]   options. They've made the comfortable chairs. So there's fewer seats, but they seats are more
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:27.440]   comfortable. Well, that's one of the first was Alamo, where you get a taco and a beer. I went
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:32.160]   to Alamo and Austin. I said, "My God, this is amazing. They've opened one in San Francisco now."
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:37.600]   I'm sure there's one in Brooklyn, right? There's got to. Yeah, there's one in Brooklyn.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:42.800]   There aren't any in Seattle, unfortunately. The closest we have is
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:50.640]   Cinerama, which Paul Allen helped restore. And it has one of the most state-of-the-art digital
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:58.160]   screening systems laser aligned and really good sound system. And they have a slightly different
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:02.160]   model from a Draft House and some of the others, and that they only play because they're only
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:09.200]   two screens. So they only have certain-- or might actually only be one screen. They play things for
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:17.120]   limited time periods, select big releases, and then they have a catalog of older things.
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:22.080]   And something like that, I think, will be OK. Alamo, Draft House, will be OK. I think more about,
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:27.600]   OK, what about your average Regal or AMC or-- Yeah, AMC, which is already on the rocks.
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:38.080]   Yeah. They've got a parent problem as this chatroom rightfully noted. They're going to have to--
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:43.360]   I mean, their CEO, I think, said this week that they have-- they're hoping that they can reopen
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:49.520]   by mid-June. And I think that's them sort of signaling that if it lasts longer than mid-June,
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:54.240]   they're going to be in trouble. They may actually go under. And this is going to be a challenge for
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:57.040]   a lot of businesses, I think, is going to be alluded to earlier. Oh, my God. You asked the
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:02.400]   restaurants in this country will be gone. They have no resources to survive this.
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:11.040]   There are small business loans that can potentially be forgiven if you lose money,
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:17.520]   but they're hard to get because the banks aren't getting information about how to apply these loans.
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:22.080]   And the Wall Street Journal had an article this week about how difficult it is to figure out
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:27.680]   where to get the loan and how it works and all of that stuff. And we don't know how long it
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:31.840]   says lasting. So it's like, OK, you get a loan for expirative times. If I have to pay it back in
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:36.960]   three months, I'm still in trouble, right? Right. Right. Or if my loan is only going to cover
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:42.160]   X amount of rents or X amount of bills and runway, what are we going to do? The idea of the loan is
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:48.560]   good, though, because it's contingent on you retaining your staff, paying them. So it's a way of kind of
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:53.600]   trickling that money down to the people who need it the most, the workers. So I think that's not a
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:58.640]   bad thing. I'm just going to be very challenging. Here's the Alamo Draft House's website introducing
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:03.440]   virtual cinema at the Alamo Draft House. And you're right, they're going to succeed. They're going
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:09.920]   to continue because they're so unique. They're so brand. They got a great brand. It's an experience.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:15.840]   You know, yep. They were one of the first to really lean in on the fact that they were going to make,
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:20.400]   you know, go to the movies, an experience and do it in a certain way. And that's hard if not
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:24.400]   impossible to scale. You know, even as AMC and others have invested, it's just, it's different.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:30.960]   There is already a short going around that we're in China that they've relaxed the social distancing
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:35.760]   stuff like all of a sudden, it just ripped right back up. Everyone went back to the movie theaters.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:40.960]   Yeah. But then at the same time, you've seen all of the Marvel movies and all the big tentpole
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:45.840]   movies moved back to the winter because those are the things that are guaranteed to bring people
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:51.200]   back to the theater. It is kind of, even though we're saying that the Alamo Draft House has
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:57.120]   it's an event or it's more of an experience you can go and you can get food. But you're not
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:01.440]   going to see a Marvel movie there. That's for sure. Exactly. Right. So then the problem is is,
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:05.360]   it's what the problem has been with Hollywood for the last couple of years. It would be a smaller
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:11.840]   movie, a $20 million budget movie, a period piece movie where, well, people have already been starting
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:16.640]   to say, well, I just wait for that to come when I can watch it at home anyway. So if I was one of
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:21.920]   these indie theaters, why not? Like I've got the print, like set up a set up a camera and let people
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:27.200]   stream it. Who cares? No, agreed. I mean, there it's going to be interesting just to see how are they
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:31.120]   going to be? What's the first to do? Who's going to step in and shut that down?
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:37.760]   Is my question. Yeah. And say, you're violating the terms of this or whatever. Who's going to be
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:42.480]   the first one to shut it down? And it's interesting. I got it was, shoot, it was five years ago now,
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:49.120]   but I gave a keynote at CinemaCon, which is the annual conference takes place in Vegas for
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:55.520]   the exhibition. Also called off this year. Yeah. Also called off this year. And that was a really
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:00.720]   interesting experience for me about speaking there and also kind of attending in a little bit of a
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:05.200]   different way. I had attended a couple of years before, but I had asked you to speak at that.
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:11.760]   What were you talking about? It based actually using social media and new media to get people
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:16.720]   into theaters was actually talking about. That was very smart of them to ask you to do that.
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:20.720]   That's it was actually. I have to give them a lot of credit for being that forward thinking.
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:24.160]   And it was interesting though, because I was talking to a lot of the smaller chains. And
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:30.480]   we think about the big chains, but they're all these smaller theaters and places too. And I just
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:35.440]   I worry about their future because like Alamo draft house and some of the ones who are going to go
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:41.600]   off the beaten path to anyone's, I think they're going to find a way. But this is, as we've
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:48.240]   all are kind of discovering with this crisis, with this pandemic, is that so many parts of
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:54.720]   our world are all interconnected within one another. And one thing falls apart, it has a cascading
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:02.880]   effect. So I certainly hope that the movies can come back, but because it's my favorite thing.
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:10.480]   But it'll be interesting to see how it'll happen and what that will do for the larger industry.
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:14.400]   I want to take a little break. And then we have to spend a little time asking everybody what
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:19.760]   they're watching, because I'm curious, you know, what shows you're watching. So we'll take a little
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:24.000]   break, come back and do that. Actually, every time film girls on, I asked her, well, I should
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.600]   watch. So you're probably ready for this. And it's absolutely presume it's not the Gilmore Girls.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:32.000]   It's not something something else. Yes.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:39.440]   We have a brand new show we're very excited about. Ant Pruitt has launched something he calls
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.080]   Hands-On Wellness.
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:54.240]   Hey, everyone, I'm Ant Pruitt and this is Hands-On Wellness. Fitness is a big part of my life.
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:59.040]   And every week, this podcast will cover the intersection of tech and personal wellness.
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:04.640]   This is not a workout podcast, where I'm a drill sergeant demanding 400 push-ups from you.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:10.080]   Instead, I'll review and demo the latest tech that can lead you down the path of a healthier
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:16.160]   lifestyle. I'll look at gadgets such as fitness trackers, exercise tech, apps, and more.
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:21.200]   Folks, we have to take our personal wellness more seriously. I'm going to challenge you to do just
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:28.640]   that. So head over to our website, twit.tv/how, or subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,

[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:40.720]   I love it.
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:44.720]   Yeah, and he's a perfect guy to do it. He's all about this stuff. I am going to persuade him to
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:48.640]   let me come on with my brand new sewing machine and show you how to make masks.
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:53.600]   And sourdough. I'll do it at the same time. It'll be together.
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:56.320]   Our show now. And sourdough.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:01.280]   Masks and sourdough. It's all about wellness. Our show today brought to you to, by the way,
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:06.960]   twit.tv/how, subscribe. Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks. I love FreshBooks. They
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:12.560]   saved my bacon many years ago when I was a freelancer, and they could do the same for you tax time.
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:18.800]   Yeah, we got a little extra time. It's not too late to start using FreshBooks to keep track of
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:24.480]   income, assets, expenses, all of that. Yes, you can do your accounting with FreshBooks,
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:29.440]   but it all starts with invoices. It's the easiest way to make professional looking invoices
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.520]   with your logo on it to keep track of what you're doing. And by the way,
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:37.760]   FreshBooks with everything that's going on in the world wants you to know you're not alone.
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:43.840]   These guys are such sweet guys. Isolation is something that many small business owners are
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:49.760]   feeling always. And with today's situation, it's even more apparent. And we know that. That's why
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:55.280]   we want you to take a look at FreshBooks to help your work from home process or transition,
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:01.840]   be smooth. You can download the app today, freshbooks.com/twit. FreshBooks.com/twit.
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:06.160]   It lets you keep tabs on your business anywhere, anytime with that FreshBooks app on your phone.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:12.480]   It's awesome. You can create client profiles, enable automation for recurring invoices. You can
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:17.440]   watch as FreshBooks automatically combines expenses, billable time, and other items into
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:22.640]   invoices to send clients. On your behalf, you can use their accounting and reporting tools to file
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:29.920]   your taxes, evaluate your financials. Look, as times get tough, every penny counts. It's really
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:34.000]   important. It's not like the days when you could just say, "Hey, I'm sure I'm doing fine. I'm making
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.760]   money." You got to pay attention to this stuff. And now is the time FreshBooks makes it easy.
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:46.960]   24 million people have used FreshBooks. 4 and a half out of 5 stars on GetApp. I love it. It saved
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:52.560]   my life. It lets you focus on what you love, the reason you started your business by saving your
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:58.320]   time on the stuff you don't love, the paperwork, invoicing, expensive, tracking your hours.
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:05.040]   FreshBooks saves users on average almost 200 hours a year. By the way, it makes it easier to
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:10.240]   collect to you. You can stop chasing after money your clients owe you because in the invoice,
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:14.800]   you'll be able to take online payments. It turns out if it's easy for clients to pay you,
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:20.240]   they're more likely to pay you faster. On average, twice is fast. You'll receive notifications
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:24.400]   when clients open your invoice so they can't say, "Hey, I didn't see it." And FreshBooks will
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.960]   automatically send late payment reminders and bill late fees. FreshBooks makes it easy to treat

[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:31.040]   All right. Let's see what people are watching. I'll start. I finished Tiger King. Did you watch it?
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:38.240]   Anybody? Yes, I definitely did. Bizarre, weird. So weird. So weird, right? Who knew there were
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:43.840]   people like that? Now I'm launched. I'm trying to watch happy stuff.
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:49.280]   Stuff. The good thing about Tiger King is it's so bizarre you look at it, you forget your troubles.
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:56.720]   It's like, what? Andy and I go started it. He said at 10 o'clock at night, not knowing.
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.120]   And he didn't go to sleep. He did pull it all night. He watched the whole thing.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:09.040]   What are you watching? Christina? I'm watching Little Fires Everywhere,
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:14.160]   which is the Reese Witherspoon, Kerry Washington show on Hulu. It's really good.
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:21.200]   It's really good. I've enjoyed that quite a bit. Speaking of Hulu, devs. Oh my God. Have you
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:27.600]   started watching devs? No, I haven't. It's got the guy who looks just like Brian McCullough in it.
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:33.360]   Okay. Ron Swanson. Oh, wait. No, no, no, no. I thought you meant Ben Affleck.
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:39.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. No, no, no. It's really weird and interesting. And you should watch
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:44.480]   it for a couple of reasons. First of all, it's about a startup, a Maya that's an artificial
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:51.680]   intelligence startup that the guy who is the founder and kind of crazy long-haired bearded guy,
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:57.680]   Ron Swanson. What's his real name? I forget his real name. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Love him.
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:00.480]   He's married to Wetserface. Yeah, he's married to Wetserface.
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:03.840]   He's married to Megan Mulally. Yes.
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:09.840]   Chat room will tell me in a second. They're about three seconds. Nick Offerman, thank you. See?
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:15.200]   Nick Offerman, God. Yeah. They're good. He's really good. He's the founder. They're doing some
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:21.040]   crazy AI stuff. There's a very shocking first episode, something happens you didn't expect.
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:28.080]   It looks like it's going to be a mystery slash tech. But I knew I was going to like it when the
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:33.600]   couple of very early on in the show starts arguing about elliptic curve versus RSA,
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:38.560]   which is a better encryption algorithm. When they start talking about that, I said,
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:43.760]   I'm going to like this show. Not to mention Nick Offerman is awesome. And it's got a lot of high
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:48.000]   tech, interesting, high gloss. Well, and it's another Alex Garland joint, right? Yeah.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.920]   Yeah. Yeah. He's really good. So that's on Hulu too, by the way.
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:59.040]   Yeah. So HBO right now actually has like a bunch of their content available for free.
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:04.480]   Yeah. Yeah. So they have, you know, Silicon Valley is one of the shows six feet under,
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:08.320]   Barry, all the sopranos succession. One of my favorite shows.
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:13.760]   Oh, these are all great shows. Oh, why? Oh my God. One of the best shows ever made.
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:20.720]   Ever, ever, ever. And so in some of their documentaries to like the McMillians documentary, which was
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:27.840]   a series, which is fantastic. That's the McDonald's millionaire contest that was being hacked.
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:33.200]   Yes. Which happened in like not that far from where I grew up, which is insane.
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:42.080]   But yeah, so that I have to give HBO or Warner media or whatever kudos for opening up a bunch
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:45.200]   of their content for free right now. Which of those would you pick? I mean,
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:51.200]   several of those are considered the best shows of all time. Sopranos, the wire, I have to say,
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:56.640]   in my opinion, succession is the greatest show ever made at this point. I am such a fan.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:01.280]   I think I love succession. I think it's too early. It's only two seasons. So I don't think I can say
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:06.160]   it's better than the wire wire. The wire went downhill after its first few seasons. So
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:11.120]   the wire is one of my things. Actually, my probably pick is it's and it's another one,
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:17.040]   David Simon was involved with is a homicide life on the streets. That the early seasons of that.
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:22.480]   Are they giving away? Veep is Veep in that list? Yes. True blood is on it. Veep is the funniest
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:27.840]   show ever made. Veep is so funny. Six feet under Silicon Valley, Berry, Ballers. Yeah, they're all
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:32.560]   good. So lots of stuff for ballers. That's not a great show. I've watched the wire all the way
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.800]   through eight times. What? No one's listened to that. That's my that's my right. So do you agree
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:42.800]   with me, Brian, that it goes downhill after the first season? Season five was pretty terrible.
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.760]   Yeah. But season four was the season in the schools. And that was the season three is my favorite.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:52.800]   But the season with the schools was just amazing. Spectacular television. Yeah.
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:57.680]   What's neat about the wire is each season is unique. Same characters. Well, the same main
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:01.840]   characters, but different scenarios and stories. And so it's really well done, I thought. Yeah,
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:06.400]   brilliantly written. Great dialogue, brilliantly shot. It's a little dated now. I think it's
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:13.920]   four three, right? Oh, yeah, definitely. Because I think it started in 2001 or 2002.
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:19.280]   Yeah, it's almost two. I believe. Yeah. So we watched high fidelity last night, one of my
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:25.520]   favorite movies of all time. Same from the year 2001. And top five definitely on my top five.
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:28.720]   Definitely top five. And what's weird about it is
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:37.760]   2001 sounds like the present to me anything with a 2000. But that's 20 years ago. It's kind of
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:45.680]   mind boggling. This is now an old movie. Yeah. You just look, I mean, it's funny because. Yeah.
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:50.880]   Yeah. Before starting. It was funny is that when high fidelity came out and it was based on a book,
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:55.440]   you know, like vinyl hadn't gone through the research and it was still about record stores.
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:59.200]   Yeah. Well, Nick Lauren, Nick, it's great, by the way. Wonderful.
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:03.360]   Yeah. Well, well, the whole thing was that it was weird that you had this guy who was
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:09.360]   into records in 2000. Was it weird in 2000? Oh, okay. Yes. And weird. It was weird then.
[02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:12.960]   Now it's not weird because like it's this big hipster thing and like vinyl.
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:19.440]   It's come around completely. Yeah. Completely. But then it was like this like obscure kind of,
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:22.800]   you know, hobby. They didn't like they didn't. I don't think they had cell phones. There was a
[02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:28.960]   lot of activity with landlines. They're at it. They're eating dinner and they've got a
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:34.000]   cordless phone, not a cell phone, a cordless phone on the table. It's like,
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:41.280]   but that was 2001. It doesn't. I guess I'm getting old. Hey, speaking of high fidelity and Hulu,
[02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:46.240]   by the way, you guys are aware that there's a Zoey Kravitz high fidelity. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:50.000]   watched it yet. In fact, I'm glad now that I watched the movie. I knew that Zoey Kravitz was doing
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.720]   a remake. It's a series. Is it good? Yeah. I like it. I haven't seen it.
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:21:00.960]   I was reluctant to watch it because I love the original so much.
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:04.480]   And John Cusack is so good. She's playing the John Cusack part.
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:07.520]   She is. She does a good job with it. I mean, it's different. It's similar, but it's different.
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:11.680]   They've done a good job with it. What's interesting, those, you know, her mom, Lisa Bonae, was in
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:18.000]   the original. I know. What was in the original? Well, it's also weird that Lisa Bonae and Zoey
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:25.440]   Kravitz could be twins. I mean, she just literally, they look exactly the same. It's pretty hysterical.
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:29.360]   All right, Jason, you haven't ponied up with something. What do you want to? What do you want?
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:39.200]   Man. Okay. So this is so nerdy because my viewing habits are like Gen Z. I spend most of my time
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:45.120]   watching YouTube. Awesome. Even though we have subscriptions to Netflix and other things. So
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:49.280]   it's always something. And I was just looking at while we were doing this, I was like, I got to go
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:54.880]   look at my YouTube history, I guess, and sort of dig this up. So some of it is just the last couple
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:59.440]   weeks of what, you know, I've been working on. I mentioned this interfaith thing that I've been
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:05.840]   doing. So because I'm a Baha'i, I've been learning about different other faiths, like the Bhagavad
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:09.760]   Gita, I've been doing a thing on that, which is really fascinating because that's actually
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:17.200]   this 3000 year old book that's about people during a crisis. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah,
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:24.160]   which is, which is, it's like this existential crisis. So that was super cool. And also been learning
[02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:30.240]   stuff about filmmaking because, you know, we're seeing that as a huge video operation,
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:36.240]   but there's no operation, right? So we're everybody's having to film and do stuff on their own. So
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:42.480]   I'm learning as much as I can to help all of our I love what Lexi Savidis is doing from home with
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:48.880]   the cooking Instagrams and stuff. It's so cool. It's really fun to see people kind of discover a
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:53.840]   new medium almost. It really is amazing. And it's going to be fundamental, it's going to
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:23:00.640]   fundamentally change the way we do video forever. I have no doubt. So I've been doing that where
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:05.600]   I'm learning a lot of essentially filmmaking techniques that really we're learning from
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:11.280]   YouTubers and people that have been doing it with just regular cameras, not big fancy cameras and
[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:17.440]   phones now, especially, you know, these latest phones, which can shoot some amazing video. So,
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:26.160]   so I've been doing that. And then also just doing stuff. I love the health and wellness stuff that
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:34.800]   Aunt mentioned because I've been doing more kind of stuff around meditation and deep breathing
[02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:41.760]   and those kinds of things because there's so many people that are so stressed out. And I
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:47.040]   found last year when I started tracking my sleep, one of the things that I learned was that my
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:54.640]   heart rate variability was really low, which meant especially when I was sleeping, which is not good.
[02:23:54.640 --> 02:24:00.240]   And so one of the things for that is to do deep breathing and potentially mindfulness exercises
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:06.480]   before you fall asleep. And it had a really big impact. And so I've started taking that and doing
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:11.360]   that more often. And so I've been trying to kind of hone that practice and learn more about that.
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:16.640]   And then, you know, potentially do write some things about it and what I learned and my whole,
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:21.920]   you know, bit from learning about that sort of in the middle of last year to, you know, now this
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:27.360]   year when everybody is stressed out or anxious, even if they still have a job, you know, because a
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:33.040]   lot of parents are at home, they've got their kids, they're sometimes in very small places that they
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.160]   can't leave. And there's a lot of people with a lot of stress and anxiety in their lives and trying
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:45.280]   to find ways to help, you know, people that work for me that work with me, you know, and just trying
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:50.960]   to be useful and helpful to people. What's a low heart rate, my variability, mine's 25 milliseconds.
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:56.640]   Is that okay? Is that low? That's bad. Yeah, mine was like 29. And it was like, that was,
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.600]   yeah. That was the average though. That was like the average when I was sleeping.
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:06.800]   Yeah, because that's what I this is the aura ring. That's what I use. And I start, this was a
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.280]   sponsor some I think a year ago or two, but I started wearing it because it also measures body
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:14.800]   temperature. And I want to keep when your body temperature goes up, of course, that's a sign of
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:18.640]   illness. I want to keep an eye on that. Just five minutes a day, listening to yourself breathe.
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:22.400]   I got a meditate. I got to start meditating. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:28.480]   A little bit of a high your whole life. Since I was 19. Nice. My first girlfriend was a
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:35.520]   Baha. Really? Yeah. It's a beautiful religion. Yeah. I just, the other thing I'm thinking is
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:39.840]   interesting is a lot of people in quarantine are discovering it as a new medium. New York Times
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:46.400]   had an article about a comedian Meg Stalter who started doing character sketches from her home
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:53.600]   on Instagram. And they're very rough, but they're very funny. And they're kind of wild. She's kind
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:26:01.600]   of crazy. Worth checking out. She said because she got featured in the New York Times and everything.
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.960]   And she's got a podcast and she's only has 27,000 followers. So I'm going to, I'm going to give her a
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:11.760]   plug. She's just kind of kind of kooky, but that's I find this fascinating because it,
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:17.600]   there's a new medium arising. I mean, this is what stuff people can do at home with what they got.
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:21.200]   You know, that looks like Cindy Sherman stuff. You remember that?
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:27.040]   It is kind of like, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Where she inhabits a personality. Yeah. Yeah. Meg does that.
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:32.160]   She's a standup comic, but she's found, I think, a bigger audience doing that crazy stuff.
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:37.680]   Couple of sad notes. I'll, I don't want to end in a sad note. Let's see. All right, I'll do
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:43.280]   these and I'll find something good. Jack Scofeld, who is the guardians ask Jack,
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:48.960]   tech columnist died at 72 this week, not related to COVID. Although whenever you hear this now,
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:52.880]   every time I see somebody's name trending on Twitter, I'm going, Oh my God. Oh my God.
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:27:01.040]   And Nick Justinon, who was the technology writer at the AP for a very long time,
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:08.480]   passed away. He was a young guy, a marathoner, but he died at the age of 51. And he did die of
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:18.080]   coronavirus. So excellent shape. He had done marathons on all seven continents, 83 marathons in total.
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:26.240]   He loved the movies. He watched 365 movies last year. Most of them in theaters. He was the deputy
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:31.360]   technology editor at the Associated Press died in New York City on Thursday of coronavirus related
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:38.400]   complications. So this is, this is a list that's going to start happening. I'm sorry to say more
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:44.320]   and more. It's, it's very sad. Quibi is coming. Speaking of things to watch,
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:53.280]   what do you think of a quibi? This is the short form streaming video service by Meg Whitman and
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:28:00.480]   Jeff Katzenberg. I don't know. Do you want to watch short shows? Is there a marketing?
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:06.720]   Fascinated by the concept. I think there is. I'm fascinated by the concept. I'm not crazy about
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:11.440]   any of the first shows they put out. None of those make me think like, Oh yeah, I've got to see that.
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:18.800]   But all big celebrities, big names, right? Yeah. Yeah. Because they have a lot of money to spend.
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:25.600]   It's not TikTok. It's not YouTube. It's Quibi. You can get it for free. I think for some,
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:30.080]   I can't remember three months if you're a T-Mobile subscriber, they're starting to make deals,
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:37.040]   launches on Monday tomorrow. Yeah, it's interesting timing. I think I read something. I didn't read
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:41.040]   the article. I just saw the headline that it's either like the best or the worst timing for a
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:47.600]   launch. You know, I've intrigued by this because I think the concept is interesting. I definitely
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:52.320]   think that there's a market for it there. It depends on the execution a lot. Content is hard,
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:59.120]   but Jeffrey Katzenberg, I would never bet against him because his track record speaks for itself.
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:04.240]   But yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I think that there is probably a place, especially as we're
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:12.240]   all consuming stuff to kind of sit in between YouTube and Netflix and Hulu and TikTok and other
[02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:22.480]   things. I'm definitely going to sign up. I went to their keynote at CES and I sat in the audience
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:27.920]   and I was like, "Oh, this seems like a really good idea." And then I walked out and I remembered,
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:33.680]   "No, this is a dumb idea." I always do that at Keynote. It's the reality.
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:36.800]   The star should feel the good keynote will make you think anything is a good idea.
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:46.320]   Why is it a dumb idea? Because number one, who needs, why are they hamstringing themselves and
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:53.040]   doing the short form? Some of the things are just like little episodes, episodes or whatever.
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:59.520]   But some of them are shot like real movies where you have to watch it 10 minutes at a time.
[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:03.280]   So why are they not just putting it together as a two-hour thing? It's like this weird experiment
[02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:06.960]   and not to put on the history hat, but Leo, you will remember this. I mean,
[02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:11.440]   Katzenberg and Spielberg and all those guys did pop.com back in the dot-com bubble.
[02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:17.200]   And it was the same thing where he was obsessed with five minutes or two. It's like Katzenberg,
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:21.040]   somebody told him that kids today don't have an attention span or something. And it's just
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:26.240]   never left his head. I've always gone in the opposite direction. I'm the guy doing two-hour
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:29.280]   and a half podcast effect. That's right about where we are. But that's my point. It's like,
[02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:35.520]   why are they artificially hamstringing themselves? Like just so, okay, we're only going to make
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:40.800]   the quibi the name is Quick Bites. So that's their whole reason for being. But I just don't
[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:48.160]   understand why they're doing it that way. Here's what I find. I will find intriguing
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:54.640]   is if they find, if this is a new medium where they can say, look, you got, that's what TikTok did
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:31:01.840]   and vine before it. And it became something pretty important because the constraint made it
[02:31:01.840 --> 02:31:09.680]   interesting. So if you just take a 22 minute sitcom and chop it up into chunks or a two-hour
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:13.280]   movie and chop it into chunks, that's not interesting. And I'm afraid, which is what they
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:16.080]   seem to want to do. Given their Hollywood roots, they may do that.
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:21.600]   Right. I'm with you. It's like, if that's all it is, and that's not interesting, but this has
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:25.120]   always been the promise of these mediums to me. And we've seen some people do it successfully,
[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:29.120]   but many of them not. Usually by accident, right? Yeah, usually
[02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:33.440]   slack. Who knew that Vine was going to become make these celebrities and stars?
[02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:38.320]   Right. But if you adapt the medium, that's actually, I think you're right, it's an interesting
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:43.760]   constraint. But if all you're going to do is chop existing things up, I mean, it's similar to,
[02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:48.960]   I think Netflix now, people have finally hit their stride and starting to produce TV shows for the
[02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:54.160]   age of binging. But for a long time, and in summer, still produce this way, it is still very much
[02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:59.040]   produced in an episodic way, even if all the episodes are released at once. And that adjusts
[02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:03.520]   your story structure. You have to give background. You have to catch people up because you're
[02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:09.760]   producing them in capsules, whereas now we have started to see more shows go into it.
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:12.400]   We're not going to give you the back story. We're just going to continue on the extent.
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:13.840]   No more previously on...
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:22.480]   Right. But it'll be interesting to see if they can start to create new things just for this medium.
[02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:29.120]   My podcast co-host, Simone DeBrosch for Polygon where she works, they are working on something for
[02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:32.880]   Quibi, and it won't be launching at launch, but it'll be available after that. And she seems
[02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:38.320]   pretty excited. So very least. Well, I would never root against Simone. I think she's great.
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:48.400]   I'm not a good person. And so I'm rooting against him because I have a little... It's almost
[02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:53.680]   shot in Freud. I don't want them to succeed because I don't want to see Hollywood march into
[02:32:53.680 --> 02:33:03.600]   our realm. I feel like if it organically develops, if Vine or YouTube or Periscope or TikTok,
[02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:09.360]   organically develops as a new medium from the ground up, from the grassroots up, that's great.
[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:13.760]   If Hollywood says, "Oh, let's see what the kids are doing, we're going to make up something that
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:18.960]   the kids will like come from the top down. I hate that." That's why I think it won't work.
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:22.960]   That's why I'm rooting against them. And it may work. Who knows? But that's why I'm rooting against.
[02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:30.400]   And nothing against... I'm a terrible person too. And I definitely have my own shot in Freud
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:34.960]   a thing. But don't you think that one of the problems that tech companies have had,
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:40.400]   I think just in general, has been they don't understand content? And conversely,
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:43.440]   one of the problems that Hollywood places have had is they don't understand technology.
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:50.160]   So... We've been waiting for the so-called convergence since 2001.
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:56.560]   I think Netflix is probably the closest we have to that, or maybe Prime. But even then,
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:02.400]   I think you could argue the reason that Apple TVs, initial four reason to content didn't work is
[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:08.640]   they didn't have content people doing anything. And that's why we got things like attack of the
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:16.320]   apps or whatever the game show was called. And once they hired actual content people from Hollywood,
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:22.400]   the content got a lot better. So, I don't know, you need a mix, but it's interesting. But I'm with
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:28.400]   you. I'm skeptical, but I'm also... I don't know, any time this much money has gone into something
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:34.400]   and you have people... This cache is either going to succeed despite the hype cycle,
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:40.400]   or it's going to be one of those really interesting, wow, people really thought that was going to be
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:47.360]   a thing. It wasn't. I do think, Brian's right, though, that I think the instinct is right, that
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:53.360]   this could be one of those things where they're looking at the Hollywood industry is looking at
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:58.400]   YouTube and is like seven minute videos. That's what everybody wants right now. So, let's just take
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:04.400]   our two hour movie and cut it into seven minutes, license, and give it to them, all like that,
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:09.040]   which is just getting... It's like willfully misunderstand what the whole thing is about, right?
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:14.640]   I agree. Well, we'll find out tomorrow. We'll find out tomorrow. April 23rd, the FCC will set a vote
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:22.960]   on the opening of the six gigahertz band for unlicensed use, including Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi 6E.
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:30.560]   That is really interesting. I mean, Wi-Fi happened because the 2.4 gigahertz band was unregulated,
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:35.600]   mostly because they thought baby monitors and telephones would use it. Along comes Wi-Fi,
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:41.280]   and this is a perfect... Another example of kind of the serendipitous discovery of something new
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:46.080]   that changed the world. Now they're getting an extra... They got then got five gigahertz. Now they're
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:51.040]   going to get an extra six gigahertz band. I think we'll be covering that as that happens. I'm sure
[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:56.080]   they'll vote. Yes on that. It would free up 1,200 megahertz of additional bandwidth for next gen
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:36:02.640]   Wi-Fi. 6E devices with antennas and chips, it's capable of tapping into it. Nothing you have
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:11.040]   today is capable. So, the whole new realm of things. I think we've done this long enough. It's
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:18.720]   time to self-isolate. Go home. Get out of here. Thank you, Jason Heiner. He is Executive Director
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:24.880]   at CNET and a wonderful fellow to boot. And you can find out more at Jason Heiner on the Twitter.
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:28.400]   Anything you want to talk about? Are you working on something that you want to share with the world?
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:35.680]   Yeah, just that one of the things that my team has been doing, some really great work over the
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:43.360]   last few weeks since we started to hit the heart of the storm on coronavirus. We're probably a few
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:49.200]   weeks away from that. But doing content just to help people. So, they're doing content to help
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:57.360]   people work from home, content to help people cook, help them to know what self-isolating means
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:03.200]   and what are some of the best practices, help them find educational resources for their kids,
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:08.160]   because they're having to educate their kids, keep them occupied and doing something constructive.
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:14.640]   So, I've just been super proud of my team. They've tried to take all of this coronavirus stuff and
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:22.960]   not capitalize on it, but actually just be super user focused and find ways to just be useful
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:30.400]   and helpful and find the ways to produce content that's going to make people better,
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:35.440]   less anxious, more productive in some cases and better parents, all of those things.
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:41.440]   SeenIt.com, you can find it all there. There's actually a COVID-19 page on there, but
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:46.800]   it's not really about COVID-19 so much. It's about all of the things that people are doing and ways
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:52.000]   that we can offer to help deal with it. And also, obviously buying advice for products and which
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:57.840]   things to avoid and which things you can get and lots of things are sold out, so which things you
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:02.720]   can actually find right now. Actually, this is not that page, but this is some I'm going to
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:08.240]   tell you about in a second. What is the, tell me the page again and I'll pull that up real quick.
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:13.440]   Yeah, if you go to seenIt.com and just in the upper left-hand corner, there's COVID-19
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:19.440]   is our page that it has some information about that, but you see we have how to
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:25.360]   and thrive at home. Those places too are also... Oh, this is very, this is good.
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:29.760]   See, this is what I like is that people are taking this as also an opportunity to do something
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:36.800]   new and interesting. And this is a great way to live in the world that we're in and make something
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:45.120]   of it. And by the way, do recommend Roger Chang's piece. We didn't really, we ran out of time.
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:50.800]   There was so much to talk about. Of course, the T-Mobile merger with Sprint was official on April 1st
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:57.760]   and John Ledger. As he said, he would step down as CEO of T-Mobile and a great piece on how
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:04.240]   John Ledger changed the mobile world for the better. It's a great commentary from Roger.
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:12.240]   Yeah, a fascinating guy who did in fact improve, I think, on world by competing with the big
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:16.800]   cell phone companies. So, just changing the way they do business. Do we know what John's going to do
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:22.160]   going forward? I don't think so. He hasn't announced it, but I mean,
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:26.640]   no, he was my favorite CEO for a quite some time. A lot of fun to cover, right? A lot of
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:32.080]   fun to cover. Very fun to cover. Very fun to cover. Yeah. Thank you so much, Christina Warren,
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:38.560]   for being here, film girl, at film_girl on the Twitter. Of course, senior cloud advocate at Microsoft,
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:44.880]   fancy snazzy dresser and a terrible cook. It's great to have you on the show.
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:49.600]   Thank you, as always, for having me. Oh, we love having you on. You're just the greatest.
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:54.160]   Thank you, Christina. You are in one of the hot spots. How are things in Seattle these days getting
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:40:00.000]   better? Well, I mean, the trend seems to be going in the right direction. I was a little bit
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:05.840]   concerned with how many people we kind of saw out and about today. We knew why we were
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:11.600]   on the road, but we saw a lot of cars out. But you don't know what their reasons are. I don't
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:16.160]   want to don't want to judge us too harshly. But yeah, I mean, our governor has said that the state
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:22.400]   will be in lockdown for another month. So just getting real comfortable with my apartment.
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:28.560]   Yes. And I hope you have plenty of lipstick stocked up because, yes, very important.
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:34.080]   Yeah, it is. No, I actually, you joke, but I mean, I'm having like concerns like I need to get my
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:37.200]   haircut. Like there's all kinds of haircuts going to be interesting. And you can see I'm getting a
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:41.200]   little shaggy. I'm not going out. I'm not getting my haircut. I'm going to look like this.
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:47.200]   It's already been open. Yeah. We're all in this together. We're going to find out what everybody's
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:53.040]   real hair color is in a few weeks. Thank you, Christina. Thank you also, Brian McCullough. I
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:58.560]   think he's Natche, a natural brunette, I believe so. Brian is the host of the Tech meme ride home
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:06.560]   podcast and the brand new podcast, the morning Corona virus update, ride home.
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:11.520]   Corona virus morning, Corona virus morning briefing. I'll never forget this morning report.
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:16.640]   I'll never nobody's going to get the title, right? But it's all you got to do is go to ridehome.info.
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:22.400]   And there it is right there. You can you can listen to it. A quick half hour, 15 minutes to half
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:27.760]   hour on what's going on in the world around us. Good timing. The only reason we did it is because,
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:31.840]   you know, for two years, we've been putting ourselves in front of the fire hose of tech news to give
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:36.320]   it to you in 15 minutes. And so we thought, all right, let's put ourselves in front of the fire hose of
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:40.720]   this COVID news. And we're not nice. We're not breaking all the news. But if you're nervously
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:45.600]   refreshing all your feeds every five minutes, we're going to hopefully cure you of that because we'll
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:49.360]   tell you all you need to know in the morning. And you're doing games and celebrity news now.
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:55.280]   That's right. You're not the host of all of those, are you? No, no, I do the Corona one and the Tech
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:42:00.800]   meme one. But we have someone out in LA that does the celeb news one. And we have a great
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:06.160]   tech journal, our games journalist that got laid off in one of those recent waves that we were able
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:11.600]   to pick up and put them on the put them on the payroll to do a games right home. Are you part of
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:18.800]   the art 19 family now or is that just a partnership? That's just the host. Yeah. Yeah, cool. Great to
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:24.640]   have you, Brian. I do want to mention just talking about new media while we're all stuck at home,
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:33.760]   the star of the office, John Krasinski, everybody's favorite nice guy started a YouTube channel a
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:40.320]   week ago. It already has a million subscribers. And his first video has 12 million views. It's
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:46.320]   called some good news with John Krasinski. And I love it. It is very low tech. It looks like he's
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:52.960]   got a table light as one of his lights. And he looks like his daughter made his sign SGN.
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:43:00.800]   But this is what we need now is real people who used to be famous movie stars doing shows from
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:09.680]   their home. You know, they're all getting in the act. I should go start a movie. I should get a
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:15.440]   sitcom. Serve them right. Thank you, everybody for being here. It's great to have you Christina
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:20.560]   and Brian and Jason. Thanks to all of you to help you're staying home and staying safe. We do
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:25.280]   Twitter every Sunday afternoon. And we're gonna keep doing it. Our 15th anniversary episodes,
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:33.040]   two weeks off, Kevin Rose, David Prager, Robert Herron, three of the original cast members from
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:40.000]   Twitter. Number one, we'll be joining. Oh, no, I don't know if Prager's joining us. Patrick Norton,
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:45.040]   I left out Patrick Norton. So three or four depends who we get of the original cast members. But at
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:52.240]   least Kevin Patrick and Herron will be there on the 19th as we celebrate 15 years, no cupcakes,
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:58.880]   no balloons. We're donating the vast sums that we normally spend on confetti and balloon drops
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:03.920]   for this kind of event. We're donating it to local first responders because they need it a lot more
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:10.800]   than we do. But I hope we'll see you here for that 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC. You can
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:16.160]   watch the live stream of twit.tv/live. There's also live audio streams there. And you can get
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:22.400]   every show we do on demand at our website, twit.tv. Best thing that you could do would sure help us
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:28.080]   is subscribe in your favorite podcast client. That way you get it automatically every Monday
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:34.240]   morning in time for your commute from the bedroom to the living room. I know you won't get a whole
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:39.680]   lot of the show, but you can listen again on Tuesday. Or maybe just take some time and listen.
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:44.240]   We appreciate your being here. We're all part of it, the family, we're all in it together.
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:49.520]   And we thank you for listening. Another twit is in the can. Take care.
