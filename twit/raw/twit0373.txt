[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.640]   starting all the way to my right with Mr. John C. Devorak.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.280]   I wanna thank you for filling in for me.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.120]   Ah, yes, that was great fun.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.800]   Oh boy, I got all the tweets.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.960]   Oh my goodness.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.040]   You sucked.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   Did Robin really actually say the iPhone
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.960]   should be sold at the same shelf as Tampax?
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.800]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.640]   Okay, just checking.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.320]   I thought maybe the Twitter was--
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.160]   It's all cranky geeks.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.080]   It was great, it was really fun, I really enjoyed it.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.920]   And I appreciate it.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.440]   Did you like the bottle of wine we got for you?
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.000]   Was that okay?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.840]   It better be.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.680]   Oh yeah, it was.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   It was a, well, it was for people out there
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.600]   when I was at 95 to hard me loan as far as I remember.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.440]   Yes.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.680]   I heard that's good.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.200]   Yeah, no, you know, you probably get took it
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.120]   from your own case, right?
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.960]   Of course I did.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.800]   Yeah, it's a good one.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.160]   I'm a dollar of Leo Laport.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.360]   As is this fine--
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.120]   Two years you started drinking it.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.040]   Is that really two years?
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.880]   Maybe three.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.760]   17 years old now.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.480]   It's older than my son.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.640]   It was at 95 or 2000.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.800]   Oh, maybe it was 2005.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.080]   Yeah, then we should wait.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.280]   Robert Heron, good to see you in original Twit.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.320]   Haven't had you on in ages, it's about time.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.080]   Always a pleasure.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.520]   Robert works for Revision 3 still, yes?
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.680]   Yeah, come back, work for them.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.000]   And you also have your own business.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.520]   Totally.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.800]   Working for different manufacturers,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.280]   helping make better products that people buy.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.840]   There's a story for you today, which
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.120]   is that the Japanese television companies are tanking.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.960]   We'll talk about that.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.560]   Well, wait, before you go on, can you get us a deal?
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.920]   I know.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   What good is it?
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.040]   I know.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.640]   What's the website?
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.320]   Heron Fidelity.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   Heron Fidelity.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.120]   See, it says on the screen if you're watching the video.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.440]   And pardon the mess on the front page right now.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.600]   There's like three articles in the works.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.520]   You're a busy, busy guy.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   I am.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.080]   Also with us from All Things D, it's
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.640]   great to have Liz Gaines back.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.360]   Once again?
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.120]   Thanks for coming all the way down here.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.120]   Up here.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.520]   I don't know where we are.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.040]   Up.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.280]   Yes, I actually used the new--
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   Did you use Apple Maps?
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.880]   And did you find it?
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.480]   I did.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.080]   I didn't come exactly on time.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.840]   But I think that was because I was trying not to be distracted.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.880]   Also, it also is Petaluni.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.760]   Yeah, I said Pasadena first, which is my error.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.200]   I didn't go that way.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.000]   You said I want to go to Pasadena.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.840]   I'm glad you did.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.000]   I said, "Tweet Studio Pasadena."
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.200]   And it said, "Sorry, we don't have your Twitter
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.120]   credential yet."
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.960]   Oh, boy.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.760]   That's not good.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.280]   Yeah, then I--
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.960]   Then you said, "Tweet Studio Petaluma."
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.400]   And did it actually know?
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.320]   No, it still thought I wanted to tweet about it.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.720]   Yeah, this is a problem.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.400]   And now I can finally sue Twitter because of Siri
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.640]   because we predate Twitter.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.440]   And now I could say, Siri's confused,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.720]   so this must be a problem.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.920]   Yeah, so I don't know what the command is.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.840]   I tried Get Directions, and didn't like that either.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.400]   Navigate to where the hell am I?
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.600]   Siri's weird that way because with the Android phones,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.320]   there's like a rigid syntax that you're supposed to use.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.480]   But Siri, they want--
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.640]   It's trying to be more flexible.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.140]   What?
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.120]   You kind of just try stuff until it works.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.960]   But then I don't know.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.120]   But then you don't know.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.800]   That I did say, Siri, can you get me there?
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.960]   And it said, yes, Liz.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.800]   And that was nice.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.000]   That it can get me here.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.680]   That makes you feel better.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.240]   Lies.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.080]   Somebody called the radio show today and asked me
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.520]   if there was a way to get a Siri not to have a female voice.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.200]   I said, yeah, you could use a British, the Canadian voice.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.560]   That's male.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.240]   And B, if I could get it to say profanity, she said,
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.400]   my husband wants an iPhone.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.040]   But unless he can swear in his text messages, he doesn't want it.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.720]   And I don't know if a guy is this.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.480]   So I looked it up.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.600]   And of course, Gizmodo has an article on how to make Siri swear.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.000]   Oh, excellent.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.240]   So one way is to change your name to mother, Fletcher,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.400]   chicken head.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.840]   And it will say that.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.280]   Are you-- your majesty?
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.760]   You're what--
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.560]   So just as Liz.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.000]   I'm disappointed.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.400]   Well, I guess it logged into my Apple account.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   Oh, you see, you got--
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.900]   I don't know.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.080]   I did a big upgrade today from 4 to 5.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.880]   Today you did it?
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.840]   So I had never had Siri before, yeah.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.360]   Oh.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.960]   How do you like her?
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.320]   That's good.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.800]   Getting a like her, getting along?
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.600]   I haven't scratched it yet.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.480]   You got a case.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.440]   I can't believe you found it.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.440]   I did.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.800]   I can't understand.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.440]   Because it's for one day.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.560]   It's bragging about it.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.400]   That's scratching it already.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.880]   I know.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.280]   So Apple has done something--
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.360]   Oh, I think it's so great.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.080]   --close to unprecedented.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.280]   There may be another case of Apple apologizing.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.400]   But of course, anybody who's following tech news
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.760]   knows that the Apple Maps have disappointed some.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.160]   Somebody sent me an email.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.320]   I said last week that Apple Maps worked well in China.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.360]   And I was saying that from an article that said it surprisingly
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.840]   works well because they got better data.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.600]   And then somebody sent me an article said, well, I live in
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.640]   Chongqing.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.520]   And it's terrible.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.960]   Yeah, it depends on the data.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's data that--
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.120]   It depends on the source of the bogus information.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.280]   And the other issue, of course, is that Apple has to match
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.640]   information from disparate sources--
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.920]   Yelp, Tom, Tom, other data sources.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.960]   It has to get it all together.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.320]   And Google's got a lot of experience doing this.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.720]   Does anybody remember--
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.760]   was Google Maps this bad when it came out?
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.240]   No.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.760]   No.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.520]   It was good off the box.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.360]   They also invested early on in companies like the
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.880]   satellite imagery companies as well.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.680]   And so did Apple.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   Apple bought three mapping companies a couple of years ago.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.240]   Google Maps is on the web for four or three years working
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.680]   on this.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.320]   So it had a little more heritage.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.160]   Yeah, I mean, I don't think people were using it for turn
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.400]   by turn directions when the first day it came out.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.920]   Right.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.560]   Well, Tim Cook writes on the Apple website to our customers
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.960]   that Apple was strived to make--
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.600]   I should get the Tim Cook puppet.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.960]   Where is it?
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.320]   I got to get Brian Hogg on the line.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.360]   He made one for us for the--
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.760]   Oh, you didn't get it yet.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.600]   Well, he has it.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.560]   He sent over the templates for us to make our own.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.520]   Oh, we could print our own.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.040]   Let's just hold the show for a few hours.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.880]   Could you just print some Tim Cook puppets?
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.400]   Right.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.040]   Get a sewing machine.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.840]   And then we'll come back with a--
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.360]   This template.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   Yeah, you mailed it over.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.440]   Yeah, so we can make our own.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.880]   We should put that on the web.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.400]   That's great.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.560]   At Apple, we strive to make world-class products
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.800]   that deliver the best experience blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.680]   With the launch of our new maps last week,
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.760]   we fell short on this commitment.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.840]   We're extremely sorry for the frustration
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.320]   this has caused our customers.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.720]   We're doing everything we can to make maps better, which
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.640]   apparently involves having you fix it.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.920]   There are over 100 million iOS devices
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.080]   using the new Apple Maps with more and more joining us.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.560]   Every-- joining us every day.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.600]   And just over a week, iOS users have
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.680]   searched for half a billion locations.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.320]   He doesn't say whether they found them.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.920]   The more our customers use our maps, the better it will get.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.600]   And we greatly appreciate the feedback we've received from you.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.640]   And a number of people have said,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.960]   it's not our job to fix Apple's mad maps.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.560]   But it will get better, right, with use.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.200]   And that's how Google got their maps in the shape they
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.280]   were, those where they actually mentioned competitors.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.440]   The next paragraph is the one that I think is unprecedented.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.000]   Maybe Apple's apologized before, but they never said this.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.640]   While we're improving maps, you can try alternatives
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.600]   by downloading map apps from the app store like Bing.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.720]   MapQuest-- Bing's Microsoft.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.640]   MapQuest is Yahoo or Waze.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.280]   Or--
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.560]   AOL.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.600]   AOL owns Waze?
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.800]   No, MapQuest.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.320]   Oh, AOL owns-- that's right.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.840]   AOL owns MapQuest, right.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.200]   Thank you.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.160]   Or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.360]   and creating an icon on your home screen.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.000]   That's pretty bad.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.280]   That's not a substitute.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.080]   Oh my.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.840]   Well, it's also kind of a shock to say,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.080]   go to our competitors.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.200]   I mean, go use Google.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.840]   We're sorry.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.440]   There is an implication here that we
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.520]   wanted to provide our customers with better maps,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.920]   including features like turn-by-turn directions, voice
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.200]   integration, flyover, and vector-based maps.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.320]   This kind of confirms the rumor.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.080]   Maybe it was all things D that broke this rumor
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.720]   that Google had refused Apple the right to do turn-by-turn
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.240]   directions.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.240]   And that's ultimately what--
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.200]   Apparently in the terms of service for access
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.520]   to their map data.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.720]   So if you want access to Google's map data
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.240]   and you're not Google, you can't
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.880]   provide turn-by-turn, which is built into every Android device
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.760]   out there.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.680]   Well, but you could make a deal because MotionX GPS uses
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.880]   Google Maps and has turn-by-turn.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.000]   So you could make a deal.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I know.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Payed app.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.520]   So I think the history of this is, for a long time,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.600]   people paid a bunch of money to put garments in their car.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.560]   Right.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.600]   And then--
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.440]   And Tom Thompson.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.040]   And Tom Thompson.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.720]   And Magellan.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.040]   Have a gone.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.720]   People make bulky devices.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.640]   You put in your car that are specific to this purpose.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.760]   And you pay money for them.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.240]   Then one of the first Apple--
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.160]   I remember when they demoed when they first launched
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.000]   their app platform was going to be--
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.600]   was it Tom Tom made an app that was like $99?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   100 bucks is right.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   Turn-by-turn directions.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.280]   That's right.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.040]   And then Google was like, well, we want to include this
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.200]   in our devices.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.520]   But they were going to charge them $40 per app user.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.600]   So Google, instead of paying someone else to do that,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.480]   they put a massive investment into building this themselves.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.960]   So they finished building it themselves.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.240]   And they're giving it away for free.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.760]   And then Apple was like, oh, we also want it for free.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.760]   And Google was like--
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.280]   Hey, we paid it.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.600]   How about this for an idea?
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.720]   They got over $100 billion in the bank.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.160]   Why don't they buy Tom, Tom, Garmin, and Magellan,
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.640]   and these other guys and just incorporate to things.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.200]   And by the way, if after they do that,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.000]   you're going to fire the guy who gave him that $40 deal
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.920]   or the $100 deal.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.440]   Just go track him down and fire him.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.240]   They are buying Tom Tom's data.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.920]   In fact, Tom Tom's--
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.160]   Why don't they just buy Tom Tom?
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.400]   Tom Tom said very quickly, it's not our fault.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.760]   Because people use our Tom Tom app happily.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.760]   It's not our fault.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   So what's the difference?
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.160]   Because I think it's the data mismatch.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.760]   The ability to take data from various sources,
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.840]   merge it together in a useful map.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.080]   There was a computer scientist in Ontario, Canada, who did--
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.520]   he scraped the Apple Maps and did a little calculation
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.400]   on how accurate.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.200]   It's all anecdotal, right?
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.160]   Well, it worked fine for you.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.920]   Got here.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.200]   Worked fine for me.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.360]   Well, it didn't work fine for me.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.560]   So here's some actual numbers.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.360]   His name is Jason Matheson.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.680]   He wrote code to determine how accurate the maps are in Ontario.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.840]   That's probably the biggest, most important province
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.720]   in Canada, not an insignificant.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.800]   It's where Toronto is.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.240]   It's where Ottawa is.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.880]   It's where the--
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.800]   I always vouch for BC.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.920]   All right, all right, all right.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.160]   2000-- so we'll do it in BC.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.080]   But for now, we got Ontario.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.880]   2028 cities in towns, OK?
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.760]   688, not even on the map.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   551 wrong, clearly wrong, wrong country.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.280]   Country.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.680]   Street names are a problem.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.200]   That's a problem.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.840]   Street names are similar to town names, et cetera.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.960]   389 close, but not good enough.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.440]   For instance, the turn-by-turn might send you off a bridge,
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.120]   but you'd get rescued close to where you want to be.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.000]   Only 400 out of the 2028 cities were right.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.600]   That's a number that really kind of quantifies this, right?
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.360]   1 out of 5.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.880]   So John Pachowski writing, as I thought for all things D,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:27.200]   said that the talks crashed over voice-guided directions.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.880]   Huge.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   That makes sense, that Apple said, well, we need them.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.800]   And if Google's not going to give them,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.400]   we've got to do it somewhere on our own.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.240]   Now, you said something about them buying one of these--
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.480]   Somebody in the chat.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.960]   Nokia bought-- was it NavTech?
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.760]   And Ericsson bought Telenav, or it might be vice versa.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.200]   Nokia's put $9 billion into maps, and it has good maps,
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.640]   as it was--
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.360]   who else is driving vehicles around with masks on them,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.560]   photographing every street in the United States around the world,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.760]   underwater, air views--
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   And buildings.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.960]   I've even understood that this building here
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   that we sit in--
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.440]   3,500 of the best engineers in the world on street views.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.840]   Just on maps, right?
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.080]   All right, so for the person in the chat room who
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.720]   said that there was Garmin wouldn't sell,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.000]   Garmin has no choice as a publicly traded company.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.680]   They could take over.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.720]   They could do-- no, they could do an offering.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.920]   And by the company's net value--
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.440]   or the enterprise value, which is the real value--
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.560]   is $6.7 billion.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.600]   Market Kappa 8.1, they could probably buy it for $10 billion.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.800]   So let me ask a question.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.680]   Are we making too big a deal out of this?
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.120]   How important is this really?
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.440]   We're certainly spending a lot of time on it.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.560]   I think maps are coming to be one of the most important things
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.160]   that you can do on a phone, right?
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.080]   Now you can get yourself around the world holding something
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.920]   in your hand, and you depend on it.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.400]   So once you're depending on something,
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.880]   and someone goes into a replace a nap that
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.760]   works with a dip doesn't, then I think that is a bad mistake
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.160]   on Apple's part.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.240]   The story goes that Steve Jobs--
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.680]   the original iPhone didn't even have maps that two weeks
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.360]   before the announce-- I don't know if this is true--
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.040]   before the announcement of the iPhone
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.640]   Jobs said, we need something that will show off the touch.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.680]   What about a maps app?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.760]   And they hurriedly negotiated a deal with Google.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.800]   Well, the reality is, though, maps are now
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.160]   one of the most important things on your phone.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.960]   And what this is telling is that nobody at the time
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.480]   realized how important location was going to be,
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.840]   and how important mobile was going to be.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   I think Apple knew how important mobile was going to be.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.880]   They committed to the iPhone.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.520]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.800]   Everybody, for the last decade before the iPhone even came out,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.960]   we're ranting about how mobile's going to take over the world,
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.280]   all the internet traffic is going to be over mobile.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:30.800]   You've heard this.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.400]   You're older than me.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:31.920]   I don't remember that.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.600]   And so it went on and on and on forever.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   And I'm always like, well, you know, I'll wait and see.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.800]   Of course, it finally did.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.240]   And now the maps thing shows up.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.280]   And as soon as people saw how handy it was,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.480]   especially you didn't have to have a garment or a tom tom.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.680]   You could use these little phones,
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.560]   especially with a turn-by-turn,
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.800]   it should have been a--
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.040]   you know, right, at that point, you
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.880]   should have just put gun all in on that.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.880]   That's why I think Apple did make a mistake here.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.560]   They didn't recognize the importance of--
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.760]   Well, I think they knew, but they didn't--
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.080]   maybe they thought this was good enough.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.960]   You know, some people are blaming Scott Forstall.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.480]   Scott Forstall is the guy who created iOS.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.520]   He runs iOS for Apple.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.440]   And--
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.680]   Is this the guy who says he's going to take over the company?
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.400]   Apparently he's quite-- I didn't know this.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.920]   Apparently the story is he's quite ambitious.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.040]   Yeah, I think he came out in one of the big publications.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   I'm going to take over there.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.000]   He came from next.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.720]   So he was with Jobs, you know, originally.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.800]   And he worked on Snow Leopard, I think,
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   Philip Elmer DeWitt, who is really a good observer of Apple,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.400]   has been covering this beat for a long time,
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.000]   writes now for Forbes, asks a question,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.440]   does Apple have a Scott Forstall problem?
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.080]   And I think the issue is--
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.760]   even John Lewigase says, Forstall's demo was flawless.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.080]   2D and 3D maps turned by turn navigation,
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.240]   spectacular flyovers, but not a word from the stage
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.960]   from Scott about apps limitations, no self-deprecating
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.400]   wink, no admission that iOS apps is an infant that needs
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.800]   to learn to crawl before walking running
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.880]   and lapping the front runner.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.840]   Instead, we're told-- and this is the quote--
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.320]   "The most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.720]   Would Apple be off the hook if they hadn't said that?"
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.480]   No, they still would.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.040]   They still replaced a working service
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.600]   with a non-working service.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.560]   It's the action, yeah.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.080]   But I mean, they-- Siri and Maps both are iOS software
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.120]   projects that are not as good as advertised.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.920]   Siri is another failure, and that's exactly--
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   And also a Forstall project.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.920]   But I don't know.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.840]   I mean, I also hate iPhoto and iTunes.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.000]   Like those are software on the Mac.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.720]   Right.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   Apple's not perfect.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   There's no-- I mean, unfortunately, even those of us
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.560]   who use Macs-- and I noticed that 3A out of the four computers
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.400]   on the set are Macs--
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.920]   This by no-- I don't want to--
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.420]   Go on.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.240]   You're borrowing.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.880]   I understand.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.800]   It's not your Mac.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.960]   It's our Mac.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.680]   But it was not that we hit-- we hate Apple here.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.200]   Certainly, we've used Macs a lot.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.960]   I use iOS.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.480]   But everybody who uses Macs has to recognize,
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.040]   except the absolute fanboys, that there are lots of--
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.840]   iTunes is horrible.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.240]   We're waiting for this update.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.840]   Adam Laskinski, who writes for--
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.760]   Yeah, but hold on a second.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.840]   You're a little bit-- you're a little bit
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.520]   bigoted on this whole topic.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.320]   I am the abascian of objectivity and non-bigoted--
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.360]   You've been black-balled.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.920]   I have been black-balled?
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.760]   From Apple Events.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.840]   This is true.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.280]   Hiling on, Robert Heron, I expected more from you.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   But I've never heard the answer as to why.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.120]   Oh, I know why.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:43.840]   It's not the issue.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   That's not the issue.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.080]   I don't mind-- I mean, frankly, I wouldn't go to the events
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.600]   anyway.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.000]   In fact, it's very possible--
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.500]   Oh.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.000]   No, it's very possible that one of the reasons Apple doesn't
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.040]   invite me is that I stopped going to events,
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.200]   even after invitations, because it's easier for us
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.000]   to cover it here.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.080]   If I'm in the event, we can't actually cover them.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.520]   So what we do, what we've been doing for the last four
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.400]   years, is covering the events from here live.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.640]   So are you blacklisted or not?
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.960]   I am blacklisted.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   Blacklisted is different than not--
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.120]   I don't know if I'm not invited.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.520]   Wonder what?
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.280]   Does Apple tell you whether you're blacklisted?
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.200]   No.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.840]   I do notice that most of the people who
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.520]   end up working for us end up not getting invited.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.000]   So that's called blacklisted.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.280]   I think we might be blacklisted.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   The common thinking is that it was because during the original
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.000]   iPad announcement, I took my laptop,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.840]   turned it around, and faced it to scream and streamed
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.160]   the announcement to our network.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.040]   And getting garnering the largest audience we've ever
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.280]   had on the network, well over 180,000 live views,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.840]   because nobody was streaming this.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.880]   What was that?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.280]   That was January of-- when was it, 2009, 2010?
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.360]   What, for the first phone?
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.400]   Yeah, the first iPad.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.160]   Well, that first iPad.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.840]   And I wasn't invited subsequently.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.200]   But--
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.920]   You didn't think much of it?
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.800]   You know, it's fine with me.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.920]   And that certainly doesn't mean that I have an axe to grind.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.920]   I'm just saying that you should--
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.240]   You should never take it that way.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.440]   You know, and as somebody said, pointing out, this is true,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.520]   that sometimes I would be invited and sometimes not.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.760]   It's mysterious are the ways of Apple.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.840]   No one knows why.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.640]   People get invited or not invited to an ad.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.760]   You are carrying it.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.840]   That's a minor thing.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.240]   I do think, though.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.800]   I see this.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.680]   I always get in trouble.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.920]   Here we go.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.360]   Well, they gave iPhone 5s.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.240]   Now, I understand they're going to give it to--
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.720]   in advance, they give them all weekend--
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.040]   Oh, yeah, you don't get them in advance.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.240]   You have to go there.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.240]   You have to buy it.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240]   I don't know.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.880]   That's very proper.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.960]   That's proper, I agree.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.720]   I would never do that.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   But David--
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.360]   But David was.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.600]   Was is worth--
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.120]   OK, go with it.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.560]   He could call somebody and say, hey, can you give me
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.040]   a couple of iPhones?
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.560]   Yeah, he could.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.400]   I don't know why he doesn't.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.960]   In fact, I guarantee you, he gets them,
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.440]   but he still waits in line because he
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.200]   likes to be with people.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.240]   He just likes to hang out.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.760]   He loves people.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.640]   We love that about him.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.840]   He's the was.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.800]   Although, I don't know why.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.840]   He apparently wants to get Australian citizenship.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.080]   That's a little strange.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.800]   Oh, really?
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.960]   This is news to me.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   He--
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   I'll ask Gina about it.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.560]   He says, because of the National Broadband Network
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.680]   in Australia.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.080]   By the way, Australia, I've been to Australia.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.560]   It has crappy internet services.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.080]   He's going for the internet.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.560]   By the way, I think Korea does, too,
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.720]   if you ever really hang out there.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   Really?
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.240]   Yeah, I think it's--
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   Really?
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.560]   There are notorious for the best.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.720]   Yeah, I guess in spots they have a fantastic internet,
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.480]   but just the average hotel room and the rest is mediocre.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.880]   I would go to Sweden, 100 megabits, 25 bucks.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.800]   Sweden is fast everywhere.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.320]   That's because it's government subsidized.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.280]   Any event?
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.760]   Where was I?
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.640]   Oh, god, I have to backtrack now.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.640]   Wasn't it?
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.140]   Australia.
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.240]   Blackball, D'Ivoireau.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.320]   He's going to be an Australian citizen.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.120]   I'm going to get blacklisted from Australia.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.000]   Adam Laskinski writing an inside Apple.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.320]   If there's a knock on four stall,
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.320]   it's that he wears his ambition in plainer view
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.280]   than the typical Apple executive.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.320]   This is what you were saying, John.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.760]   Yes.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.520]   He blatantly accumulated influence
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.800]   in recent years, including it is whispered
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.240]   when jobs was on medical leave.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.320]   According to an unflattering profile in Bloomberg Business
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.960]   Week last year, four stall had such a fraught relationship
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.720]   with other members of the executive team,
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.400]   including Johnny Ivan, Bob Mansfield,
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.600]   that they avoided meetings with him unless Tim Cook was there
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.320]   to moderate.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.960]   That's not healthy.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.600]   It's true.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.920]   So should Scott four stall take the fall for the maps?
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.320]   Oh, why not?
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.520]   I just think the problem is bigger than anyone ever anticipated.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.720]   If Google truly does have over 3,500 engineers
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.160]   all day full time on their map.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.760]   The CEO takes the heat.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.440]   It's his job.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.040]   You can just simply swap that out
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.400]   with any other service right now.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.320]   One thing to realize is that the previous Google Maps
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.360]   app for iOS that worked fine.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.520]   It wasn't great, but it was fine.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.880]   Didn't provide turn by turn.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.120]   Didn't have turn by turn directions.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.120]   Turn by turn is a big deal.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:45.640]   It has some new years.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   It has some new years.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.040]   And it just simply gets you there.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:48.320]   It didn't have to be--
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:48.880]   The previous one.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.280]   But it didn't have-- it was like the weird things
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.840]   where you want to get directions from where you are.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.080]   You have to go to your bookmarks.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.760]   You have to go to your stupid stuff about it.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   But that was Google data made into an app by Apple engineers.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.280]   It was an Apple app.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.400]   This was not a Google app that was replaced by an Apple app.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.640]   This is an Apple app with Google data replaced by an Apple
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.560]   app with Apple data.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.080]   And that's why it's--
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.400]   That doesn't encourage the people writing the apps
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.600]   to work on it full time either and to keep it updated
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.840]   and to make it the best thing possible.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   Right.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.320]   So now Google has to create a team where they didn't have one
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.120]   until they started getting inklings.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.840]   This was going to happen.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.480]   Because this has been obvious for a while.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.920]   I mean, Apple said this was coming.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.840]   In June, they said, in WWDC.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.480]   But even before then, we knew it.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.360]   Everybody in the press knew it because Apple--
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.480]   Remember when there was the debacle about Apple
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.720]   storing a database connecting Wi-Fi access spots
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.560]   with your location?
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.080]   Remember that?
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.960]   It was on your phone.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.840]   It was publicly accessible.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.120]   Totally.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.280]   We could all download the data set.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.240]   In their apology then, they said, well, we're collecting
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.600]   this data for traffic.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.440]   We want to have traffic information.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.000]   So it was clear Apple was planning something.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.280]   They were acquiring companies.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.120]   They acquired three mapping companies.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.560]   So I don't believe Google when they say, we didn't know.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.640]   It's a good time to be a customer.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.360]   We were stunned.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   By the way, somebody's pointed out, I think this is probably
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.080]   not that important.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.920]   But if you look at the icon, the new Apple Apps icon,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.080]   it's of one infinite loop.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.200]   It's very similar to the old one.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.600]   You probably can't see that.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.360]   But there's circle.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.760]   There is one infinite loop.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.040]   And you drive down the street right in front.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.680]   And it actually takes you onto the freeway overpass
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.560]   and then says, jump off onto the freeway.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.920]   So even the icon is deadly.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.440]   Jesus.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.840]   You mean when you go off the icon?
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.360]   No.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.720]   So you're on and overpass.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.240]   You're on and overpass.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.480]   And there's the 280 freeway.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.080]   It's hang a left off the overpass.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.320]   It's definitely on the on ramp.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.280]   It's not an on ramp.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.680]   The on ramps pass that point.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.480]   And you wonder why you're not invited.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.000]   So this is being picky.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   That's picky.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.360]   It's just an icon.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.320]   Don't think Steve Jobs would have noticed that.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.120]   He was worried about the color gradient in the icon.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.440]   He was trying.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.160]   He was busy.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.680]   He was busy.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.720]   He was busy.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.360]   It was really busy.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.000]   Google apparently is not-- well, it's unclear
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.520]   whether they're working on or not working on a Google Maps
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:49.920]   or iOS.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.840]   Oh, they're absolutely working on it.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.880]   They've got to be, right?
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.480]   So we just agreed.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.520]   It couldn't have been a surprise.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.960]   They could have started working even as late as June.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.200]   But Google has also been pretty--
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.920]   their iOS apps have been pretty bad.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.440]   Remember when they released Gmail?
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.040]   It didn't work.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.200]   The Google Plus was more--
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.720]   That was the biggest shock for me going to Android.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.800]   It was how messed up every Google app is on iOS.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.640]   Oh, but wait a minute.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   The G Plus app is really--
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.480]   I mean, it's not my biggest game.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.960]   The G Plus app is fantastic.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.800]   They have a competing model.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.640]   They have a competing model.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.320]   Normally better on the Android platform,
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.720]   as far as Google is concerned.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.560]   The look to feel the integration.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.600]   It's got four-stall.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.120]   It's gorgeous.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.720]   It's a Twitter page.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.440]   And he's got 66,000 followers.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.840]   And Nez hasn't tweeted yet.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.800]   I know.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.280]   Awesome.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.440]   We're all following him hoping he'll say something.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.600]   He'll never say anymore.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.160]   Not anymore.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.720]   You know the first one.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   Hasn't Larry Ellison tweeted once?
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.240]   It was like, suck at Salesforce.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.840]   That's a good tweet.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.320]   That's about it.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.160]   That's Larry right there.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:39.920]   Sounds, yeah.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.080]   And then I'll--
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.640]   My yacht is bigger than yours.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.040]   Suck it.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.720]   Wait, you just sold their island in Hawaii?
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.200]   He bought it.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:46.880]   Is that Ellison?
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.360]   Bought it.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:47.880]   No, he bought it.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.360]   He's selling it.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.960]   He bought Molokayer.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.800]   No, no, no.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   I got to know what that was.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.320]   The who is.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   The who?
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   How about Molokayer?
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.080]   Was it Molokay?
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.720]   That's the leper.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.240]   The leper.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.760]   I don't think he would have bought that.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.680]   Now there's no lepers there now.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.720]   There might be.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.440]   That's Florida.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.920]   Was the last time you were there.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.800]   I've looked at it.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.440]   Let me see.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.520]   He bought it from David Mardock of Dole Foods.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.360]   And it was Molokay?
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.720]   I'm checking right now.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.440]   It was the pineapple island.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.480]   The Dole Plantation is huge.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.360]   It's all over the big island.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.080]   It is Lanai.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   Lanai.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:19.600]   Lanai.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.920]   There's fewer people there.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.760]   It doesn't say how much he paid.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.840]   How much would it cost to buy an island like that?
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.840]   Half a billion.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   No.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.200]   It's like some paper deal.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.840]   100-- OK, I'll give you some idea.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.040]   141 square miles of lush tropical aisle.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.280]   Cockroaches.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.760]   Those islands.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.760]   Especially though the big island, the Hawaii.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.080]   Oh, we rented a car.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.720]   There were so many cockroaches in this car.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.960]   It was astonishing.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   And they're not little bitty New York's cockroaches.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   They're all over the place.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   They're giant tropical dogs.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.120]   Well, they have the big ones too, but there's a medium size.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.440]   They talk like Eddie Murphy.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.280]   They also have those big giant-- those huge ones.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.920]   I'm a giant cockroach.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   That guy.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.920]   We're going to make waffles.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.360]   So I was at Drysdale's bar.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.360]   Drysdale?
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.400]   Yeah, he has bar on the big island.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.200]   And so-- or he did.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.080]   And so there was one of these huge palmetto cockroaches.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.080]   Huge.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.080]   The thing was the size of a small rat.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.080]   Oh, I hate those things.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   He still got a lot of them.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.560]   And so was everybody in the bar saw this thing.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.360]   Walking, walking along on the floor.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.040]   And-- but nobody said anything.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.320]   There was only one person that was oblivious to this thing.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.280]   There was some woman talking to her friend, Yakin Away.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.240]   And the cockroach was headed toward her.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.480]   And so nobody says anything.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.520]   The cockroach went to a pole.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.760]   That was-- she was like leaning against.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.720]   And went up the pole and dropped himself on her shoulder.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.920]   It was the funniest thing I've seen for a long time.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.920]   We saw a screech from hell.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.080]   It's like that, what's the famous screech that guy does?
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.000]   Oh, god.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.480]   Anyway, that's my cockroach story.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.280]   That's Hawaii.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.440]   I love bugs.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.240]   Spiders.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.640]   Sorry, but you went off track here a little bit.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.160]   There it is.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.760]   OK, see that?
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.720]   So there's the one infinite loop.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   It's that circle.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.320]   I'll try off the bridge.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:02.800]   OK.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   At least you're in a vehicle.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.840]   They're not telling you to jump off.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.680]   You could walk.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.480]   It doesn't say you're in a car.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.960]   And you're saying, so that's--
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.160]   There's the off-- there's--
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.440]   It should go over.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.720]   But you know, probably somebody said, oh, no, that doesn't
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.200]   look good.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.320]   So we're just going to have it hang a left off the bridge
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.440]   under the 280 freeway.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.920]   That's the part of 280 where the north is west and--
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.520]   Yeah, but it is.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.080]   --not diseased.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.000]   Don't get too--
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.800]   --attached to that.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.480]   So-- and I'll show you that because nobody believes me when
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.840]   I say iOS works well in China.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.120]   This is a guy who said it.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.160]   He believes in China.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.480]   Anthony Drendel, he says, I'm just
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.000]   saying that because Apple chose Auto Navi to provide map
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   services in China, that's a local Chinese company
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.200]   with great maps of China.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.960]   And he says that if you compare Google Maps to Apple Maps
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.320]   in China, it's--
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.440]   this is Google Maps very sparse Apple Maps.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.640]   Lots of information.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.360]   And now he says, oh, I was wrong.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.480]   Not using Auto Navi.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.560]   Oh, well.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.400]   He still says it's better.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.680]   Well, that went off the cliff.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.000]   It did.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.640]   Now I didn't read the updates.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.320]   People are taking me to task for saying iOS 6 Maps is better
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.720]   than the previous Maps.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.080]   Oh, well.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.960]   There's disagreement.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.440]   OK.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.000]   Good deal.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.440]   Never mind.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:14.960]   It's not me.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.840]   I'm just saying it was him.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.000]   I'm just reading somebody else.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.880]   I don't live in China.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.400]   How do I know?
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.560]   We're going to take a break.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.040]   Oh, well, wait.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.960]   There's one more map story.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.880]   I don't know if this is good or bad.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.120]   Apparently, Google Maps blurs things
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.440]   like the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:33.960]   Just so--
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.720]   They blur faces.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.040]   They also blur license plates.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.640]   But they blur top secret government installations.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.360]   Probably at the request of the government.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:40.920]   Good news.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.640]   Apple doesn't.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.440]   So there is one thing--
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.240]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.320]   --where if you're a spy, a militant--
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.560]   an agent, you might want to use the Apple Maps.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.680]   They just seem a little bit better.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.560]   In fact, Turkey's a little upset.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.360]   Turkey's in Raleigh Island, which is a military forbidden zone.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.200]   Don't look at us.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:57.760]   Don't look at us.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.240]   Doesn't want-- Google says we don't blur based on government
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.400]   request.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.440]   There's a good example.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.200]   Well, they blur personal private problems.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.520]   This is Mina Mitotre Shima in Japan.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.600]   You asked them to.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.920]   They'll do it for personal private.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.920]   They say we don't do it for government request.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.360]   But their data, wherever it's coming from, apparently,
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.600]   is-- this is Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.720]   You can very clearly see the runway.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.400]   No, wait a minute.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.040]   That's the island.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:22.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.440]   You can very clearly see the runway on the Apple map.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.960]   But the Nokia and Google Maps--
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.320]   It looks like a runway to me on the Google map.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   Oh, maybe you're on it.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.440]   But they-- what was a keyhole that they bought back in the day?
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.280]   They bought keyhole data.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:36.760]   That's right.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.120]   One others that they overlay.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:38.440]   I mean, that's--
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.040]   But now they have their own satellite.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.880]   That's sweet, too.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.440]   It's just neat also to be able to overlay all of the multiple
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.160]   sources of satellite data that used to be--
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.240]   you couldn't even get access to that kind of information
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:47.760]   a long time ago.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.160]   Or you had to subscribe to it for such crazy fees.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.440]   And the day Google bought that company out and started
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.800]   providing that information--
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.520]   Free and charged.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.000]   It's cool.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.920]   And they've been working on this stuff for a long time.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.040]   So the fact that they're so ahead in their mapping efforts
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.640]   at this point, it's not really a surprise to me.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.440]   Did you see that the guy behind Keyhole
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.160]   launched a new app this week?
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:05.600]   No.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.120]   Kind of cool.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   So John Hanky, H-A-N-K.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.160]   He was the CEO of Keyhole when they bought it.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.560]   Worked at Google for a long time in charge of map stuff.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.640]   Got bored, was about to leave.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.000]   And they're like, no, if you stay,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.520]   we'll give you an incubator.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.200]   So they just released their first app on Thursday.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.920]   It's Android only.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.480]   But it looks really neat.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.240]   It's called Field Trip.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.760]   And the idea is, as you're going around the world,
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.080]   ideally in a place you haven't been much before,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.440]   you get push notifications saying, hey, this statue is of
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.120]   so-and-so.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.040]   Or hey, did you know this restaurant is great?
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   Or whatever it is.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.480]   And it--
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.200]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.040]   That'd be so sweet.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.960]   Knowing that this guy did Keyhole, you kind of want to give it
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.400]   a chance.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.920]   He's taken that concept of when you visit--
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.480]   This is not a new idea.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.680]   Italy, visiting the Colesseum.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.520]   You can buy a little deal.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.800]   You put up your ear and walk around.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.520]   And it tells you what we'll do that.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.720]   This could use location data and do that in real time to end.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.560]   And you know what?
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.120]   I thought--
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   I thought-- I mean, this is a little nerdy.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.280]   But I thought what's really cool about it is that it just
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.320]   inserts itself into your life when it's relevant.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.400]   Obviously, if it overdoes it, that'll be really annoying.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.440]   But just getting a push notification saying you are near
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.960]   this place, here is some information.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.520]   Like, that's kind of cool instead of actually getting
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.240]   into the habit of using a new app, which no one ever does.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:14.760]   I appreciate that.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.320]   Google's got that issue, though, don't they?
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.720]   Where they have to be careful about inserting themselves
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.400]   into your life.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:19.840]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.920]   Yeah, like they have Google now.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.680]   They do that with that Google-- what's that thing called?
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.200]   A new--
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.680]   Google now?
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.440]   Well, now I like now.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.000]   I do too.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.760]   It tells me when the A's are winning a game.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:27.760]   I did.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.280]   Yeah, I did.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.400]   It's just learned what you're interested in.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.600]   I spy on me.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.640]   So tap the arrow to be--
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   Here's field trip.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.240]   Tap the arrow to begin.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.360]   Field trip rings you when it finds something interesting nearby.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.000]   Needo.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.400]   Explore feeling lucky.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.440]   Did you say needo?
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   I did.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   I just wanted to point that out.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.760]   Except the fact that it shares my phone.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.080]   I'm going to allow any access to field trip.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.400]   You do whatever you want.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.720]   I give you permission.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.960]   So look, so this is what's nearby.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.720]   They should have one about you guys.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.880]   American graffiti, which people come about it is they--
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.440]   They don't have--
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.120]   there's no user generated info.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.280]   It's just publishers that they're working with.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.120]   So it's like--
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:06.880]   And conversion too.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.560]   Local guides, kind of things.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.280]   This is cool.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.200]   So you can't add one about Twit unless you convince--
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.360]   Well, we're in there.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.160]   We're plugging it.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   We're plugging it.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.000]   We're plugging it.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.360]   Let me see.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.360]   I just received a notification.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.280]   And now it's gone completely blank.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:21.760]   Field trip is a--
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.600]   Is it responding?
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.800]   Do you want to close it?
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.300]   OK.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.080]   I'm looking at my--
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.600]   That may not be their fault because I'm using
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.960]   signage in mod.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.280]   It could be broken.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.160]   Do you use any of the near field communication stickers?
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:32.660]   I do.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.480]   We have one right out there.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.560]   And you see when he came in?
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.280]   Just tap your phone against it.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.440]   You'll check in on 4-square.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.520]   Got one right in my front door to turn my ringer off
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.360]   or to turn it on.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:40.720]   Oh, really?
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.200]   Or I put one in my desk too to just turn off all alarms
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.400]   and turn the phone all the way up because I always
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:44.960]   forget to do that.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.800]   And it's like--
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.200]   So what did you set up?
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.640]   I set up two.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.440]   One near my front door.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.080]   So as I come in or out--
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.920]   And you just tap your phone.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.600]   Just tap it to it.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.240]   And it'll turn the ringer on or off.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.240]   In the car-- here's the cool one I heard somebody tell me.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.160]   It's like, if you've got the mounting bracket to do a GPS
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.040]   in your car, set the sticker to then to just turn on the GPS
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.960]   program and have it all ready to go as soon as you stick it
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.600]   in the cradle.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.040]   So it's like a million things.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.920]   And there are a buck apiece.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.440]   This is cool.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.080]   So there's like--
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.320]   There's a like and do with them.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.760]   This is-- the Awful Truth is coming to the theater
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.560]   across the street.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.160]   And it's letting me know that Trebuchet, the Awful Truth,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.600]   will be across the street on October 6th.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.080]   Excellent.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.640]   That is awesome.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.440]   Look at this thing knows that I've
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.040]   got these different devices.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.880]   I have this AT&T Galaxy Nexus and 8-7.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.280]   That's Play.Google.com.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:25.960]   It's fantastic.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.440]   Web install.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.680]   So you say, which of your Android devices would you like
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:29.720]   to install about?
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.080]   What if I wanted to do more than one?
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.520]   You can go back and do it again.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:32.840]   Well, I have--
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.080]   Why can't it just be a one-click thing here?
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.760]   I should be able to check, check, check, boom.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.000]   Have to go back and go through the whole process again?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.960]   We are laying in amazing times.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.560]   And you're complaining because you can't install it on all
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.640]   your devices at the same time.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:46.480]   Exactly.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.960]   I'm believable.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.720]   We're going to take a break.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.840]   Hey, you know, did you miss anything on Twit this week?
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.560]   Because we had some great things.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.680]   Let's take a look at what you might have missed this week
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.520]   on Twit.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.880]   Previously on Twit.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.920]   The Giz Wiz.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.760]   Oh, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   Oh, he's showing me.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.760]   He's showing me.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   He's showing me.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   Oh, getcha.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   Oh, getcha.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.000]   It's the high quality.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.840]   I thought you wanted--
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.040]   Oh, you want some of me?
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   Yeah, I turn up the--
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.880]   --hand nation.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.840]   Wait, you see this Gordo, George, you guys are going to kill.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.400]   I'm looking.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   I got something off of eBay.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.920]   And you're going to say, what?
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.200]   Windows weekly.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.240]   I get twitchy when I see people taking a photo with an iPad.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   I'll take a picture of Paul with my--
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.280]   let's see if he gets twitchy.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.640]   You getting twitchy?
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.640]   There's the twitchy.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.160]   Home theater geek.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   A lot of people--
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:37.680]   That's great.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.000]   --not calibrators, but end users might say, oh, I'll just
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.560]   make these adjustments to the CMS and the grayscale
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:44.920]   and everything.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.560]   I'll just make those adjustments by eye, which I always say,
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.520]   don't do it.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.680]   The tech guy.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.400]   iPhone 5 is just another phone.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   Twitch.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.400]   That's the quote.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.400]   Now is living with color.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.840]   And you wonder.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.120]   We'll be back with more Twitch.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.480]   John C. Devorak, Robert Heron.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.240]   Great to have you back.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.320]   I'm glad you got the black shirt memo.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:04.840]   Matching, baby.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.320]   Liz Gaines from All Things D.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.680]   But first, a word from our friends.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.120]   It's Citrix who make that great go to meeting.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.040]   You know, we could use go to meeting right now.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.040]   Liz and John have wandered off.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.320]   You see, that's what happens when you're
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.120]   trying to have a staff meeting training session.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.720]   You meet with clients.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.640]   They wander off.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.760]   Go to meeting means you can meet face to face,
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.560]   no matter where they are, no matter where you are.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560]   Go to meeting.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.800]   You start the meeting on your Mac or your PC.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.720]   But you can attend a meeting on a Mac PC, laptop, iPad, iPhone,
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   Android device.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.200]   In fact, if you've got an iPad, it's a great way to meet with people.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.480]   Because the HD faces that's built in, now let's get video from the camera on your desktop,
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.200]   your laptop or your iPad.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.600]   And you can participate in these meetings.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:53.400]   And face to face is really so important, I think, as a way to get to know somebody.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.120]   Oh, if you can turn off them.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.480]   We don't need the fine music.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.800]   But see, she's going to join a meeting on her iPhone there.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.720]   But I love it when you got the iPad because you can actually see the other person body
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.360]   language, facial expressions.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.440]   When you're pitching, when you're selling, when you're training, when you're meeting
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.880]   with somebody, your colleagues across the country, this is so fantastic.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.400]   I want you to try it free for 30 days, go to meeting.com, click the try at the orange
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:23.480]   try it free button and use the code TWIT, T-W-I-T.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   And you'll be using it.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.800]   It's $49 a month for as many meetings as you want as long as you want, but your first
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.360]   month is absolutely free.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   Give it a try.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.360]   You can cancel any time.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.360]   You don't have to stay a member.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.520]   But I think you will like this.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.600]   Show your boss, your clients, your colleagues.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.320]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.960]   Take those meetings with you wherever you go.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.360]   And I have to vouch for the video.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.520]   It's amazing, amazing quality.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.600]   Did you find something exciting, John C. DeVoir?
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.800]   Oh, you got our little beer muff.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.000]   That's a Pellegrino muff.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Nice.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.280]   Pellegrino warmer.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.200]   Styling, baby.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.680]   We keep Pellegrino in house just for use.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.440]   This is something that hipsters would go for.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.440]   What's that?
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.440]   A Pellegrino warmer?
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.440]   So the thing.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.440]   It's got my name embroidered on it and the Twit logo.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   I don't know if I need a hipster named.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.480]   It looks like a golf club warmer.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   It does.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   Like Coosie or something.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.240]   Yeah, I don't know what it is, really.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   Well, sure.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.240]   We have stuff around here.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.880]   I don't even know what it does.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.240]   It's a cleaner for your iPad.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   What?
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   Is that what it's supposed to be?
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   I'm supposed to wipe down your--
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.320]   Put your four fingers in there and then--
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.320]   Mink.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320]   Oh, hello.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   See, we do have the Tim Cook, but--
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.320]   I'm not a hipster.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.600]   I'm not a hipster.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.280]   All right, this is in speaking of hipsters.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.680]   Neil Young-- he joined Twitter, and everybody got mad, because it was obviously not Neil
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.880]   Young on Twitter.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.400]   But the reason he joined, he's starting a new music service called Pona.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.720]   So, Porpano.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.560]   For people to get ponded?
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:52.960]   It's-- well, Neil Young has been to his credit complaining about audio, compressed audio,
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.920]   MP3, says kids today.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   Kids today, they can't hear, because--
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.520]   What do you like the old man again on the family guy?
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.960]   Oh, the man is looking about the kid guy.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   Talk about the kid man.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.200]   Hey man, you sounded like me now.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.520]   I'll find sugar, man.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.080]   Anyway, it's disturbing.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.080]   There he is.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   Stereo, man.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   He was complaining.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.200]   You young people can't hear.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.720]   Because people-- Robert, look, you're the audio high-fight guy.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.520]   I tried, yeah.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.520]   Everybody knows.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.520]   People are destroying their hearing.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.520]   They don't even know.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.520]   They're listening too loud.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   Yes.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.680]   They're these earpods, even these new earbuds, which are better on the iPhone 5.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.680]   Are still crap.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   They're listening too loud.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.840]   Oh, and MP3's are so compressed, you're losing all of the juice.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.840]   Fact.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.080]   They're much better compressed audio formats.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.560]   If you've never listened to lossless audio, do it.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.960]   If you still have your hearing, protect it.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.280]   Invest in better earbuds.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.320]   They'll last a long time, and you can protect your hearing
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.640]   in a loud environment.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.240]   So you might be interested in this, probably.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.120]   This Pono, or Pono, or whatever it is.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.000]   Beginning next year, they're going to release a line of portable players.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.680]   He was on Letterman and showed it.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.240]   And it looks like a prism.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.520]   It's ginormous, but maybe that's just a--
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.360]   Ginormous.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   Oh, it's ginormous.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.920]   It's only Rachel Madow uses that word.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.400]   It's got-- can't be much bigger than the new--
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.800]   the iPad-- the iPhone.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.640]   Oh, excuse me.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   The Nano, you mean?
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.600]   But it's going to be a music download service
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.160]   and digital to analog conversion technology.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.000]   The idea is the songs will be recorded--
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.760]   or I guess transcoded into the Pono codec to sound better.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   I don't believe this.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   I don't need you there.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.840]   There's a bunch of fufu.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.440]   Well, give me lossless audio.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.360]   I don't know about that.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.840]   And a good output.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.360]   You know what Flee said?
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.800]   Flee.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   I'm using a name-dropping going on here.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.760]   They should have-- every musician have their hearing tested
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.560]   so you can know where they're at in life.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.320]   He might not-- he may be deaf as a dog.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   He's going to sit there.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.800]   DJ friends get a scream at me and they're like, what?
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.920]   Flee said, it's not like some vague thing
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.160]   that you need dogs ears to hear.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.880]   He said, it's a drastic difference.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.640]   You're wearing appropriate ear protection.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.520]   I am wearing ultimate ears in ear.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.040]   In ear.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.080]   Turned down a little bit low and all that.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.360]   Pono's preservation of the fuller analog sound already has.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.920]   This is according to Rolling Stone Magazine.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.480]   The ear of the big three record labels-- Warner Music Group,
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.720]   Universal Music Group, and Sony-- all
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.840]   will be converting their titles to Pono form.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.360]   Actually, Warner Music Group has converted 8,000 album titles
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.680]   to 192 kilohertz 24-bit sound.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.920]   That's the improvement then.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.920]   Because that exceeds CD by lots and lots of CDs.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.880]   CD's what, 128 kilohertz 16-16 bits sound.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.320]   16-48 or 16-44.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.000]   So--
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.440]   Oh, that's right.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.080]   The sampling rate is 44-1.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.760]   This will be the equivalent of the studio recording,
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.920]   which would be pretty awesome.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.640]   Well, it's still digital, so there
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.760]   are analog bigots who will say, well,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.320]   but any time you sample something, you're removing.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.840]   Yeah, but this will be the equivalent of the digital
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.240]   reference should be a lot better.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.600]   Yeah, it should be the best audio you can possibly
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.160]   hear at this date.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.520]   It should also approach the quality
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.480]   of what we've been having with DVDA and SACD,
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.160]   although this might even be a little better.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.560]   It's nice to see somebody doing that, though.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.280]   But as a downloadable file format,
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.440]   yeah, that is new and different.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.680]   It's going to be giant, though, isn't it?
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.280]   Or is it not?
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.880]   Is it not much bigger?
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.680]   The file size is-- Three times bigger.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.840]   About 50% of the wave file is about--
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.360]   --getting it a lossless file.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:21.720]   OK.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.400]   So say about 15 megs of file.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:31.360]   Flea said, Neil Young is-- the reasons aren't based in commerce.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.000]   It's just he really wants people to hear music as a musician,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   hear it as it was intended, to feel the uplifting spirit
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.120]   of music.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.360]   I'm not an audio file at all, but he--
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.040]   I do think that this is a personal passion of Neil Young.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.480]   He came and spoke at one of our conferences earlier this year,
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.600]   and he could not shut up about how terrible audio is,
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.720]   how he and Steve Jobs used to sit around and listen to records,
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.040]   and it was so wonderful, and it's terrible how
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.640]   you can get a similar experience anymore.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.280]   Get a similar experience nowadays with movies.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   If you compare a DVD soundtrack, especially older DVD titles,
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.160]   and compare it to the latest Blu-ray releases with lossless audio,
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.880]   it's phenomenal, especially if they've
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:11.040]   got new productions that are well captured and recorded
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:11.720]   in the first place.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.960]   Do you think that would be awesome if they would start offering
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.520]   192K 24-bit recordings?
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.800]   I wish Apple would do that now.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.960]   Apple offers some lossless recordings, and some of them.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.080]   They have Apple lossless.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:27.640]   But again, it's 44, 1, 16, and it's still better than an MP3,
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.600]   but what Mr. Young is talking about is a step up.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.000]   What's the rate on a WMV?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.040]   Worse, it's compressed.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.040]   So the CD, which is uncompressed--
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.680]   I thought there was an uncompressed version of WMV.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.840]   Maybe there's a lossless.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.080]   Yeah, there's a lossless.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.760]   There are lossless formats.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.880]   They're using effectively zip compression.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.280]   That's why you get the 2 to 1 ratio.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.040]   I mean, you can't compress a whole lot.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.880]   But you know what, hard drive space is cheap.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.840]   Ram or flash ram is cheap.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.760]   At this point, might as well make those file sizes bigger.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.440]   This is the Pono player, as Neil Young showed David Letterman.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.200]   That's a triangle shape of who used to make that style I River.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   That's right.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.720]   That looks like an I River player.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   Do I?
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.720]   I River is down.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.220]   Very good.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.080]   If it were a player--
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080]   I River was an awesome company.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.200]   That had a lot of storage.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.440]   Could playback 192/24.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.400]   And then you got good earbuds, maybe
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.360]   at Emodix or Shores, some top of the line earbuds.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.280]   You might have actually a bigger--
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.720]   Can you carry that around or you leave it in your living room?
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.800]   Carry it around, I guess.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:29.720]   Very simple controls.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.360]   I think so, because I mean, look at the controls.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.760]   It's obviously intended to be held.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.920]   It's kind of ugly, though.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.040]   There's two headphones.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.440]   That would be good.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.200]   Oh, it's hideous.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.640]   It's also orange.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.000]   But the point is that it's the sound.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.840]   You're getting it not for the gadget.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.360]   Totally.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.560]   It's the new format.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.160]   And if you can get enough of the people who hold the content,
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.720]   the licenses of the content and the owners
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.560]   to go along with it.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.760]   Well, he's got the record label.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   He's got the big three in him.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.440]   Involve Warner, Universal, and Sony all agreed.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.480]   I think great, too.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.880]   If you could somehow incorporate new acts
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.400]   or new music artists who are trying to get music published,
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.480]   something like that, too, as well to bring new music
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.080]   into the format.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.640]   The standard-- apparently, Neil Young has trademarked this name.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.800]   Studio Quality Sound, SQS.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.400]   I think this might be a good thing.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.880]   It will probably be a small market, right,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.520]   for people who really care about sound.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.800]   But at least it offers an alternative.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.720]   I predict a failure.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.040]   Really, you think it just go away?
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.280]   I think that's just one of these things.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.360]   Who needs it is the way I see it.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.320]   I can see the format going forward.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.840]   I would see people thinking that up.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.400]   And you're right.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.760]   I mean, people don't buy stereos anymore.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.600]   They buy home theater systems so they can watch movies.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.160]   I mean, they get a stereo as their self.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.600]   But to people really, it's a specialty thing
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.480]   to buy a high quality audio system.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.760]   Very rare nowadays.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.640]   Some people, I have one.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.400]   And people, what's this strange sounds coming from it?
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.480]   You have how many speakers?
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.040]   Do you have a turntable?
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.800]   Actually, I do, but I don't use it.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.720]   Oh.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.760]   I actually hit the turntable.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.480]   I have a real good micro-sakey, an old one
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.640]   that I used to transfer old stuff.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.160]   Surprise.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.800]   You were an audiophile among all the others.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.040]   At some point.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:02.840]   But the thing--
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.600]   You're a connoisseur.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.480]   That's what you are.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.640]   You are a connoisseur of the finer things in life.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.120]   Dilitant.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.480]   Dilitant, all right.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.280]   Which is a lower level.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.400]   So the one I really have, though, which I got from KA--
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.320]   because I was working at KA-LX for a while.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.680]   And there's a pile of thorns.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.680]   They're going to throw them out.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.440]   Those are classics.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.960]   So I grabbed one because it's got the felt pad, the whole thing.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.800]   You could queue up record.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.160]   78s.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.600]   And so when I see 78--
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.920]   It's got the big gear shift, right?
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.400]   What?
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.720]   It's got a big gear shift.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.880]   It's got a big gear shift.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   It's really-- it's a gear shift.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.040]   And it also has the pull thing.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:33.800]   It starts to motor.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.640]   You pull.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.480]   Don't mind the sound in the background.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.920]   That's just the turntable.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.640]   But listen to the music.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.200]   What do you listen to, 1812 Overture?
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.600]   Green Day is my favorite band.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.600]   Green Day, really?
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.440]   No, really.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.520]   American Idiot.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.400]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:00.240]   Green Day.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.080]   I like Green Day.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.000]   I've always liked Green Day.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.120]   I like box, brand, and brick, and chair, those are--
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   Oh, it's your favorite band.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.120]   Oh, it's your favorite band.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.120]   It's my favorite, if I was the classic.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:08.680]   You like the music.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.280]   And I actually have class of gold playing in the house
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.440]   since 1972, 24/7.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:16.920]   What?
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.680]   That's good.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.320]   You haven't stopped since 1972.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.640]   Like, it's been in the--
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.520]   like, uptime is 80 years.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.880]   50 years?
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.200]   Really?
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.280]   Where is that in the house?
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:26.840]   Any particular--
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.800]   It's in the front room.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.960]   It's just constantly placed.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.160]   Is it on a loop?
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.400]   No, no, it's from the radio.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.160]   So like, on the morning.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.000]   It's our one classical radio station.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.480]   And you just keep it on all the time.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.160]   24/7.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.680]   There's no off switch.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:43.400]   Big subwoofer and a really nice array of speakers.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.560]   And you just always have it on the--
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.680]   Even in the middle of the night?
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.480]   Yes, it's on all the time.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:46.960]   Morning?
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.440]   You walk down, you get music.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:48.920]   Bad music.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.360]   And it's actually kind of cool.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.880]   The real thing that you should know,
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.960]   and when I started doing this, is that if you have a good subwoofer
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.680]   and I got like a dual 15-inch Serwan Vega.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.920]   Big, big.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.400]   No cockroaches.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:00.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.440]   You get no cockroaches in the house.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.720]   Is that why you do it?
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.600]   No, it's not the reason.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.040]   But it's a side effect.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.680]   You should tell the folks in Le Nye about this.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.840]   It's a benefit.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.000]   They need these things.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.560]   No cockroaches.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.120]   So is it the low frequency sound scares the cockro--
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.040]   Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.480]   They think they think they're good.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.920]   Somebody's walking around the kilowatt.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.840]   The only Tyrannosaurus Rex is coming.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.960]   Anyway, good low notes.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.080]   Yeah, no, I've been doing this in '72, '24, '7.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.000]   Ever once in a while, somebody will come over and they'll
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.440]   turn it down or something like that.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:31.760]   No!
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.520]   It's like weird.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.120]   You go, wait, what's wrong?
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.240]   Do you go in there and it's like John's peace room?
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.760]   Like you go in there and you kind of zen out.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.320]   You could go in there and read.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.680]   It's a nice reading room.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.000]   It's not like blasting.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:43.520]   It's just playing.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:43.720]   No, no, no.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.120]   It's like a dentist office.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.760]   It's probably quietly playing in the background.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.480]   But wait a minute, it's a radio station so you get ads
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.120]   and announcements?
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.880]   No, no, there are local radio stations.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.400]   They're playing any--
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.440]   They become a donation model.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.400]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.840]   So it's like Pandora or something.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.040]   Yeah, the kind of.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:02.120]   John C. de Fourek, he gets no spam and no household pests.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.520]   Swamp rat says that in the chat.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:03.960]   Baseball work.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   Swamp rat's the man.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.440]   Swamp rat.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.880]   So if you live in Poland, good news.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.040]   You can get jelly bean on your Galaxy S3.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.480]   You got it here.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.920]   Yeah, you have a Nexus, so they rolled that out.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.160]   Jelly bean with butter.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:18.960]   Oh, you know what?
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.240]   Jelly bean is better.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:20.600]   No, butter--
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.560]   That's part of jelly bean.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.400]   It's part of jelly bean.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:22.840]   No, I understand.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.560]   But it's also better.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.640]   Butter is better.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.240]   Butter is better.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.040]   Butter is better.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.080]   So is jelly bean.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.560]   I like the Google Now.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   Don't you like the Google Now?
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.040]   It's a better naming convention, so--
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.040]   Butter is good.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:34.480]   What is it?
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:35.480]   It's totally dumb.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.720]   Steve Jobs said it had a lickable interface
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.320]   in the early days of the Mac.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.760]   So let's see here.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.840]   Look, heavy traffic on 101, according to Google Now.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.400]   It'll take me an hour and 55 minutes
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.320]   to get to Picasso Photo Store.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:49.880]   I don't know.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.000]   Where are you going there for?
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.520]   You were looking it up, weren't you?
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.280]   That's a Google search.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:53.760]   Is that a place?
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.320]   But apparently, you found a place
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.760]   and it told me how long it's going to take.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.360]   Is that just like--
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.160]   Giants are losing five to four in the eighth inning.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.320]   No.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.080]   But the Niners 134 nothing.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:03.840]   That was really--
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.600]   You got all your stuff in there.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.200]   91 degrees in Petaluma.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.280]   I love Google Now.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.680]   I like it a lot, although it's intrusive.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.040]   I know it's spying on me.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.360]   I was looking up something the other day
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.520]   and that because I was going to go there.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.000]   And then the next day, it has it on the maps ready for me to go.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.680]   Isn't that weird?
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.960]   I didn't even have to ask it.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.520]   I was in permission to do that.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.160]   But you don't really think about it when you say, yeah, yeah,
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:23.720]   yeah, whatever.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.680]   I do.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.760]   I think about it very carefully.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.240]   You should be fine.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.640]   Hey, honey, can I borrow your phone?
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.400]   Edie's whore house.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.040]   I know what I am bummed about, though, since leaving iOS though.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.240]   Edie's whore house.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   Is that really what a whore man would be needing?
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.280]   He's got a book one.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.200]   It's a private establishment.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.520]   They give you a key.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.400]   I think you can actually search Siri for escort services.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.560]   Where are escort services?
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.480]   Outside of Clark County, Nevada.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.920]   No, I think actually this is a feature of--
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.920]   it's thinking.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.800]   For some reason, Siri lately has been really thoughtful.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:00.600]   You mean slow?
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.560]   I found 15 escort services fairly close to you.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.000]   There you go.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.040]   None of these, by the way, are escort services.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.520]   The hideaway's a bar.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.440]   I think there's a--
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.560]   apparently thinks bars are escort service.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.480]   Apparently, yeah.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.880]   Well, it might know something we don't.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.640]   Yeah, they might be right.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.520]   Siri's smart.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.160]   Facebook does not have 63.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.120]   Oh, I was going to finish this.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.480]   Jelly Bean is coming out on the Galaxy S3,
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.760]   but they started in Poland for some reason.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:30.320]   But I rooted this, but CM 10 on it.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:30.880]   And it's great.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.640]   It works fine.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.000]   I was about to do that.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.280]   And then AT&T pushed an update that everyone wanted
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:36.960]   in the community.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.800]   So I was like in that middle space between,
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.200]   do I just root the phone and go to the next version?
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.040]   Right.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.360]   It's imminent in the new update, though.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.720]   Jelly Bean is imminent.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.800]   But I think once you do what I've done,
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.640]   it's like, well, so goodbye.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.160]   As soon as they get the new ISO up with the latest features
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.320]   all integrated, nice and clean, I'll go ahead and do it.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.680]   But my phone's still pretty new, and I'll
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.040]   stick to the over-the-ear updates for a couple more weeks.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.480]   But having a 64 gig card that you can just slip into that thing,
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.080]   full of music or whatever.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.720]   When I went to LA, I would have loved
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.400]   to have brought the iPhone 5 because I'm testing it.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.680]   And I want to use it full time.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.200]   But I don't have a battery case.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.360]   I can't put a battery in.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.640]   And I was going to be walking around for 12 hours at a time.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.840]   So I had to bring the S3 because I have removable battery.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.720]   I could bring an extra battery.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.520]   But there'll be a Muffy case for this eventually.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.080]   I think it's funny because Apple makes
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.440]   these beautiful phones, and then everybody
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.160]   puts them in a case.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.320]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.720]   Look what you got in a spec case.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.920]   You can't tell it can be any phone.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.840]   It's a tough phone.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.320]   This is the best case ever, though.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:31.960]   Do you love it?
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.600]   Because it has your driver's license.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.120]   It's hard.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:34.600]   That's cool.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.240]   Oh, that is your new purse.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.080]   So when they steal the phone, they get everything.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   But you try not to--
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.760]   This is the only thing about demagging a card,
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.040]   just not a concern.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.120]   No, it hasn't been an issue.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.680]   I had the same exact one for my last phone.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.960]   I was just wondering about that.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.760]   Like, I don't put my phone in my pocket with the other stuff.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.160]   I need it like twice a week.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.000]   And my husband gets annoyed with me
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   that I don't have cash on me.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.360]   And then I move on.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.320]   Oh, you have cash in here, too?
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:58.960]   No, I don't.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.200]   I don't carry it.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:00.760]   So--
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.040]   But you got credit cards, and you have a driver's license.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.000]   This is from spec.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Speck makes good stuff.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.600]   And they have a little store in downtown Palo Alto.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.080]   Oh, nice.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.200]   I have-- this is a spec laptop case, I think.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.520]   Isn't this-- aren't these spec?
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.240]   Or no, this is in--
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:14.600]   It's in CIPEO.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.160]   It's in case.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:15.760]   It's in CIPEO.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.320]   That's what it's--
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:16.840]   In CIPEO.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:17.400]   Never mind.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   In CIPEO?
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:18.920]   Never mind.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.120]   You know what?
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.760]   Monoprize makes pretty damn good covers for most phones--
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.320]   This is a nice card.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.840]   --for undersized bucks apiece.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.280]   This is a nice product.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.720]   Speck.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.280]   Speck, I like.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.440]   S-P-E.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.120]   What is this?
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:31.720]   C-K.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.480]   Oh, I got upside down.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.000]   Oh, and you have an in CIPEO rubber case on yours.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.720]   It's got the hard outside with the rubbery soft inside.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.280]   Like a--
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:39.840]   I don't know.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.400]   I'm just like-- yeah.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.440]   It's like a Hershey's bar.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:42.880]   Here we go.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.440]   I've already dropped this thing a couple times, though,
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.760]   so I'm pretty happy I have this thing in a case.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.360]   Like me.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.480]   The hard outside.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.960]   I'm showing my driver's license.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.360]   We just showed-- it said Cal.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:50.960]   That's all it said.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.520]   I don't put it.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.440]   I don't need to put--
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:52.680]   Thank you for not--
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.560]   I don't put anything on this.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.520]   You know, I carry it with my keys in my same pocket.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.920]   Never get scratched.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.840]   That's because it made a plastic.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.560]   It's really glass, too, on the front.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.440]   It's really glass. It's not plastic.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.920]   Three.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.640]   Carbon fiber.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.320]   Carbon fiber.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:05.920]   No, it's not.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.200]   It just looks like carbon fiber.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.640]   It's plastic, I promise you.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.200]   Is 5 million a lot of phones giga home asks.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.880]   That's how many iPhones that were sold in the first weekend.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.120]   It's 1 million more than the 4S.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.000]   It probably is constrained by supply.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.920]   They probably could have sold more.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.440]   Yes.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.000]   I think so.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.240]   So you can make a big frouro about the app maps,
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.120]   but it's not slowing the sales down.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.400]   Do you think it will?
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.160]   Do you think anybody's gone to Android or is holding off?
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.040]   No, I don't think there's people who haven't upgraded to iOS 6
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.000]   because they don't want the maps.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.560]   Somebody asked me, I have an iPhone 4, should I upgrade?
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.920]   And I said, probably should wait at least to 6.1
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.160]   and see how this maps thing shakes out.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.600]   If you use maps, yeah, I guess probably--
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.520]   I have been giving you the same advice.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.160]   I think the new phone is not really about the software.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.920]   I mean, you can take panoramic photos.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.280]   Ooh, you know, it's more about the phone.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.360]   Same as my app did a couple years ago.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.280]   So it's cool, though.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   I tried, though, actually.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.120]   You tried what?
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.080]   Taking a panoramic?
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.480]   No, that's a nice feature.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.920]   It's a much faster phone.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.760]   In fact, it's agreed by most that this is the fastest phone
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.360]   out there right now because it's custom.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.160]   What does that even mean?
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:09.680]   Is that--
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.880]   Well, if you look at the--
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.640]   what are the geek benchmarks and other benchmarks,
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.320]   it's clearly the fastest phone.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.480]   Fastest for what?
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.680]   I went from the 4 to--
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.520]   Making phone calls.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.320]   Texting.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.120]   I had the original 4.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.040]   It was my first smartphone.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.960]   How fast do you need for texting?
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:26.960]   Rolling.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.280]   Back and forth.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.000]   No, you know where it's fast panoramas?
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.800]   Things where you're really doing a lot of calculation.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.640]   Actually, it's amazingly fast in the panorama.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.920]   It's basically instant.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.280]   Even on the old-school third-party panorama apps,
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:37.800]   it's not as fast as--
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.240]   How many panoramas have you taken with this one?
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.720]   I took one.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.800]   But it was faster.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.880]   No, I take-- I have actually taken quite a few.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.640]   It's faster for--
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:49.320]   Just faster.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.560]   Would you have to just drop it?
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.000]   It's faster, whatever that means.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.320]   Well, it's really fast, but it's synthetic benchmarks.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.560]   It's faster.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.320]   And it's so light, there's almost like there's
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.280]   nothing in your hand.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.240]   That's not true.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.280]   No, it's not true.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.240]   I like glass and steel.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.200]   It's a sweet design.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.640]   It does feel like a fine Swiss watch.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.640]   That's what Behren said.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:10.920]   He said it felt like jewelry.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.800]   Doesn't it?
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.720]   Doesn't it, though?
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.320]   I mean, it feels like it's well-made.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.440]   It feels like it's well-made.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.080]   I will agree with that.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.240]   Those Chinese slaves worked extra hard on that one.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.640]   Oh, how many?
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.680]   It does feel well-made.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.960]   Well, you do feel like--
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.760]   don't you feel just the slightest bit guilty about it?
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.120]   The Chinese slaves have literally
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.000]   slave-over-working and junk out of the window.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.320]   It's 70-hour weeks.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.880]   The rest of it.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.520]   It's a little bevel work.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.720]   I think some makes it kind of cool.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.440]   Is that pretty?
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.800]   I feel like it is well-made.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.800]   I'm not used to being--
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.280]   Well, that's definitely well-designed.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   The Chinese were scratched.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.520]   It's a little distorted.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.400]   I mean, I'm like three hours.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.640]   I've got a big gouge in the front.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.200]   What?
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.800]   What?
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.280]   I could be--
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.040]   Oh, it's broken.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.440]   There you go.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.880]   I don't want it anymore.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.840]   I don't want to talk about the iPhone anymore.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.360]   That's nice.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.920]   I think you're going to stop.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.440]   Pull the rip cord.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.760]   How about Yahoo?
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.200]   What's the latest in Yahoo?
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.120]   I don't know.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.760]   Rissa Meyer apparently had an all-hands meeting at--
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.880]   Which she was going to commit--
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.800]   --an act of radical transparency.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.120]   Rhett was an old two-year-old memo.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.000]   I think it was all things D that broke this.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.360]   Yeah, it's Karis Fisher.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:25.560]   Karis, in fact, who was it that said the first thing that Yahoo
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.840]   needs to do is get Karis off their case, get her,
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.000]   get some hair.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.240]   Because bring her on board.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.400]   But now they're making her angry,
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.680]   which is not the right thing to do,
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.960]   because now she even wants to report on--
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.000]   What are they doing?
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.040]   Well, Marissa Meyer has this whole agenda
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.600]   not to allow reporters in, which involves all sorts of CIA
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.120]   tactics.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.800]   And apparently, they're sending fake memos--
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.920]   --or different memos to different people
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.600]   so they can see if a memo is leaked, who will have leaked it,
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.680]   departmentalized it.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.000]   This sounds like the HP all over again.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:56.920]   Yeah, it does.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.000]   You know, paranoid women.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.920]   Oh.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.840]   Hey?
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.760]   I said it.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.240]   You have my permission to slug him if you want.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.760]   Well, my arm is not that long.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.760]   Why don't you throw an orange at?
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.240]   All right.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.200]   Make you feel better.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   She did.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:10.700]   Blocked.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.480]   She was my simplest.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.360]   Food fight in the campaign.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.560]   Special note to readers Cara writes,
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.800]   "I would as usual embed the entire memo below,
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:22.280]   but Yahoo's top execs, most especially newly installed

[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.600]   Bell, have worked themselves into quite a lather
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.520]   over the issue of late.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.000]   Apparently, according to numerous sources,
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.200]   the company is using all sorts of leak-catching tech tools.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   Free smartphones aren't as free as you might think
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.240]   if you catch my drift.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.520]   Oh, that'd be the first thing I do as a CEO of a company
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.880]   is give every employee--
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.440]   She did.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.280]   --here's your free phone.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:45.960]   She did.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.600]   She said, no more blackberries.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.280]   You have your choice.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.720]   --the eight-point font line that says, yes, we are looking
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.280]   at everything you do.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.440]   Does anybody think--
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.840]   Is this anybody thinks is new?
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.720]   This has been going on for decades.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.200]   She also says, I would advise turning the music up loud
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.640]   when whispering in the Sunnyvale HQ.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.320]   In other words, she's saying they're bugging their--
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.480]   Read the whole building.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:08.960]   That's what you should expect.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.320]   This is not a new idea.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.360]   Is it worth it?
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.800]   What, the spy on your employees?
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.920]   Yeah, to keep this--
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.520]   Enforces kind of security.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:21.160]   I could see Apple benefits from not letting product information
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:21.560]   leak out.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.560]   But do you really want this kind of--
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.400]   No.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.400]   I think it's--
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.000]   --crowd productive.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:26.920]   --crowd productive.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.520]   I don't think it's important.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.640]   I think a lot of times the anticipation of new products,
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.080]   even though-- and also there's very few companies,
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.280]   especially if they're at size, that are big enough,
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.120]   don't have parallel development.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.920]   And so you could have people giving out these mixed messages.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.920]   And it makes no sense to the reporters.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.360]   And you get, wait a minute.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.840]   This guy says he's going to do an eight inch thing.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.720]   This guy says, nine inches.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.440]   I've seen it.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.360]   It's nine inches.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:48.960]   No, no, no.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.480]   I've seen it.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.520]   It's eight inches of liars.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:53.960]   I thought it was interesting that Apple
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.240]   was so committed to secrecy.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.120]   And then they go and sue Samsung.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.120]   And they're like, here's our secrets.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.760]   I don't think they wanted to reveal those.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.480]   But I think that was--
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.840]   There was worth a few billion dollars, I guess.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.840]   Was the cost of the court case.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.320]   Cara goes on to say, Meyer is--
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.560]   this is from the all hands meeting in the slide deck.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.280]   Yeah, I'm ready for this one, John.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.520]   Meyer is planning on doubling down on search.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.360]   As well as--
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.200]   Yahoo doesn't even have search anymore.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.120]   They use Bing.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.040]   Well, she's going to double down on it.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.240]   It's going to be Bing Bing.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.760]   Bing Bing.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.360]   That's great.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.200]   I think anytime someone says that ridiculous phrase double
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.320]   down, you should take them literally.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.920]   Bing Bing.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.280]   Oh, Bing Bing.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.400]   And advertising platforms, they're
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.040]   going to spend more money on both.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.680]   For a refresh email, I think that that's true.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.000]   Yahoo Mail is a missed opportunity.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.720]   Look what Google's done with Gmail.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.200]   It's been a very useful for them.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.520]   Yeah, they took it over the business.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.560]   And Yahoo Mail was--
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.920]   It's reasonable.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.320]   Problem is now everybody uses it as their spam address.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.040]   Don't you?
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.240]   Look, I have Gmail.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.000]   I don't get spam.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.320]   You don't get spam.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   But when you sign up for stuff, you don't give me your Gmail
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:06.800]   address.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.280]   Sure.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:07.800]   You do.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:08.920]   Well, good for you.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.760]   I give them my regular email address,
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.000]   and I don't care because I don't get spam.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.920]   I go through a filtering system that works quite well.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.760]   I think the Sir Win Vega subwoofers might have something.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.880]   There is a bunch of stuff in my spam folder,
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.120]   but I never see it.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.480]   I get awful spam, actually.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.840]   I use Google Apps for work email.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.880]   And I had to turn the spam filtering down
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.040]   because it was filtering all--
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.240]   because I get so many emails from people
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.480]   I've never corresponded with before.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.960]   So the spam filters are just like, oh, that's new.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.560]   That's what I want to get emails from,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.000]   is someone sending a tip or a pitch or whatever.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.040]   And so I turn it down, and now I get awful spam.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:43.600]   Like what?
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600]   What's awful?
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.360]   I'll show you.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.680]   So your advice is to consult your junk email
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.960]   folders occasionally just to make sure you're not
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.000]   missing stuff.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.880]   I would love-- the solution I have now is not good.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.360]   But they use Postini for Google Apps.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.360]   Postini, right?
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.360]   Right.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.840]   You have to log into this like 1992 interface
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.320]   to sort through your filtered mail.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.080]   And I was just going to--
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.000]   I use a hand to somebody's asking the chat room.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.720]   Or you go to ctimectyme.com.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.120]   Mark Perkel, an old timer.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.040]   He does all this stuff.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.640]   He basically creates this system.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.280]   Great job here on the Gmail.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.520]   I've got email from this--
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.200]   I don't know what language that is.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.320]   This is a whole lot of second folks.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.440]   This is one of the few times that Leo's actually
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.960]   opened his email to see what's in it.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.400]   I'm just looking at the spam folder.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.040]   I've got an email from Mitt Romney, Jason Calicanis.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.960]   It's doing a great job.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.160]   This is how Calicanis is running for president.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.760]   It's secrets of dog training.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.920]   Sweet.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.680]   Plan the sex of your baby.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.800]   Three tricks to make coffee super healthy.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.840]   It's already pretty healthy.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.440]   Quit putting stuff in it.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.760]   And an email from Radio Shack.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.120]   So I think it's doing free electronic cigarette.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.000]   I shouldn't go in here.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.680]   I get smoked a real thing.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.440]   Do you ever get sucked into your spam?
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:58.960]   No.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   Time is precious, man.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.480]   Well, actually, there's some Nigerian scams
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.200]   that always fascinate me, especially the newer ones.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.000]   My name--
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.240]   I am fascinated by any email and spam
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.800]   that gets through Google's filter,
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.400]   because it's usually something brand new and funky.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.840]   And it's always kind of interesting to look at.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.520]   That's interesting.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.760]   I don't care for like 10 seconds.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.040]   Gmail does a very good job unless you do what Liz did
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:21.640]   and turn it off.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.200]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.280]   I need to talk to some other sources.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.040]   Also, a general resource.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:24.960]   Some other solutions is terrible.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.480]   I get the same email every day.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.480]   Here's one from Mrs. Rosella Johnson.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.600]   I'm a dying woman who decided to donate what I have to you.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.560]   Oh, it's real.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560]   Well, that's a good one.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560]   You can be up in the studio.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.160]   Don't have to be to my personal husband.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.000]   I've lost my husband, left alone, no family.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.320]   I'll be going in for an operation.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.800]   I pray I survive.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.520]   Then it's addressed to you, Leo LaPorte.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.000]   But I have decided to donate the sum of $10,500,000
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.640]   to you for the good work of the Lord.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.160]   Aw.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.560]   Presently, I have informed my lawyer about my decision
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:59.400]   in willing this fund to you contact my lawyer at yahoo.cn.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.000]   China.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.960]   Or you can call his private line,
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.240]   if you're interested in carrying out this task.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.960]   How many people do you think that fools?
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.000]   A lot.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.680]   Enough.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.240]   In fact, according to an African studies friend of mine,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.160]   Nigeria actually has it as one of the elements
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.800]   in their gross national product.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.320]   No.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:19.880]   Yes.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.880]   You can reach-- look into this.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.760]   I wouldn't doubt it.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.480]   That's amazing.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.440]   It's called the 414 scam, right?
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.120]   That's what the Secret Service calls it.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.200]   Because I guess it's based on an old con game.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.600]   A lot of people have been famous people who have been suckered
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.080]   by it.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.080]   There's something about the making word.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.160]   Oh, somebody wants to give me $40 million.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.960]   That makes sense.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.080]   Some people will believe print more than just about anything.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:42.840]   419.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.600]   Is it 419?
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.200]   414.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.960]   Yeah, it's 414.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.640]   414.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.080]   414, no.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:47.400]   I don't know.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.160]   Somebody said 414.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.200]   I thought it was 414.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:49.960]   Oops.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.080]   I'm calling a web page print.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.960]   It's going to dubious at that.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.200]   So is it undisclosed recipients?
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.280]   It's like the key.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.520]   Who else did you send this to?
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.880]   Come on.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.840]   I'll take it when you get two of them.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.440]   Meyer is apparently going to read his--
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.360]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.240]   This is not somebody else's.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.240]   It's a 419 scam.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:09.640]   That was really such a--
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.240]   Once in a while, but I'll rip it up.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.240]   Look at that.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:12.880]   Google it.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.240]   So 419 scam.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:14.880]   Four-- you're right.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.640]   It's 419 scam.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.280]   I love Twitter.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.440]   What does that number come from?
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.480]   Here's a link to the Wikipedia, the book of knowledge.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:23.980]   Yes.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.680]   What country code was it?
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.080]   Before, 9 refers to the article of Nigerian criminal code
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.280]   dealing with fraud.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.760]   The scam has been used with facts and traditional mail.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.840]   And by the way, it was originally used with traditional mail.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.160]   And those kits are still around.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.640]   You get up thinking of packaging the mail with all the stuff
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.480]   stamped and seals.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.080]   I'd love to have one of those.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:45.440]   That'd be great.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.640]   Anybody get one of those?
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.920]   Send him along to John C. Devorek, along with any cockaroches
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:56.000]   you have, because he's got a pure for cockaroches.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.400]   Marissa Meyer, once again, Yahoo homepage, also
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.240]   going to be redesigned to focus on consumer experience.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:03.840]   What does that mean?
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.600]   She's taking ads off of it.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.880]   It's more social, more of a dashboard approach
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.120]   than a traditional portal.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.160]   Ooh, a dashboard?
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.200]   Dashboard, not a portal.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.080]   Well, that's a real-- there's an advancement.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.160]   What is the difference in a dashboard and a portal?
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.440]   Well, once a dashboard--
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.000]   Once a portal.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:17.960]   Again, Maya--
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:21.280]   And for this, the way they're internal security.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.760]   They're working on core.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.920]   This stands for content, optimization, and relevance.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.120]   Engine.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.560]   Ooh.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.080]   Relevance.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:33.000]   It's a little Facebook-like, according to some sources,
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.080]   the new homepage.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.480]   More focused on content and other products
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.600]   that differentiate Yahoo.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.280]   She has also decided to back 10 key arenas, including--
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.440]   you'll be glad to know Flickr.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.880]   She's back in Flickr.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.360]   Back in Flickr, finance and sports, which are both very strong.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.440]   Those are very strong.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.040]   Yep.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.440]   I agree.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.800]   Are they just prepping themselves to be bought by Facebook?
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   I don't think so anymore.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.440]   I think, first of all--
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:55.940]   Anybody?
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.440]   Nobody's going to buy Yahoo.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.440]   It's too late.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:58.960]   Huge nuts.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.600]   But I think also that you don't hire Marissa Meyer to sell it.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.360]   You hire Marissa Meyer to turn it around.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.280]   All right.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.000]   Because her turnaround experience is what?
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:06.760]   Zero.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.600]   OK.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.760]   But her selling experience is also zero.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   Oh, OK.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.920]   You bring in somebody who's--
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.080]   So when you bring her in?
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.240]   Because everyone's all hot and bothered by the fact
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:16.760]   they brought her in.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.320]   She's a brand.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.240]   Oh, OK.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.880]   No, I'm not convinced.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.720]   And I've yet to see any evidence that she's
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.560]   going to turn around.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.480]   But she is a brand.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.560]   And at least, at the very least, she'll, I think,
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.600]   bring a little cache to Google.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.720]   And she's done that.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.440]   It'll help with hiring and help with engineering.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.640]   Yeah, it could be.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.400]   And the board of directors very much behind her,
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.560]   they showed up for the meeting in purple T-shirts.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.680]   Oh.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.800]   And they all had the tears T-shirts and all said, Yahoo,
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.840]   B-O-D.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.080]   Bring your own something?
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:53.360]   And they're hunting for another superstar for the board.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.120]   All of this--
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.920]   How about getting a board member that really
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.800]   knows something about running a company like this?
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.600]   I don't think I'm Marissa.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.960]   That's what her job is.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.560]   I always said that they should have had Steve Case.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.200]   They should have brought him out of retirement,
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.680]   got him out of those cocktail parties.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.880]   I wrote a call on about this.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:09.320]   Better VOL.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.320]   Yes, I wrote a call on about it.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.080]   They should have brought him out of retirement,
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.480]   get him out of those cocktail parties
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.000]   where he's just enjoying life, getting wasted at these--
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.800]   you've been to these things.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.320]   You sit around with a martini.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.760]   I think we got one going on right now.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.040]   Yeah, going away.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.240]   And let him run the thing.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.880]   The guy was always the great--
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.400]   this guy was--
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.640]   he really had a weird, interesting, very futuristic vision
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.520]   that worked.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:37.760]   Now, I saw a picture of him at the airport.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.200]   What was the cover of Steve Case?
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.080]   It was just didn't make any sense at all.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   He's like Betty Crocker.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.440]   He's in a bunch of boards, and he's hanging out--
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:46.920]   Just a guy.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.200]   --non-profits.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.520]   I'm more than just a guy.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.160]   But you think he could be a guy--
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.600]   He's apparently not interested in the list.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.360]   He doesn't want to do it.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.320]   He's having fun.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.640]   Yahoo did bring back their AdSense, which is kind of interesting.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.800]   They had-- I didn't know this, but they had a contextual ad
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.600]   network for a long time.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.200]   And they are-- it's called the Yahoo Publisher Network.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.240]   I vaguely remember that.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.240]   Remember that?
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.440]   Microsoft did something too.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.640]   And the funny thing was if you tried using any of these things
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.800]   as a blogger, I experimented with all of them.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.960]   Only the Google one was easy to use.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.240]   You could sign up real fast.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.560]   It's so easy to use AdSense.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:21.800]   Boom.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.680]   You got the code.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.680]   Boom, you're on.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.920]   These other guys-- well, you know, can you have your bank
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.600]   give us a phone call?
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   You know, kind of thing.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.640]   It shouldn't be hard.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.240]   It shouldn't be hard.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.320]   We're going to take a break.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.160]   This gains us here from all things D.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.640]   John C. Dvorak, channeldvorak.com.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.840]   Ork.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.640]   Channeldvorak.com/blog.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.000]   The real Dvorak on the Twitter and knowajenashow.com.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.120]   Now twice weekly.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.120]   It is. It became twice weekly recently.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:56.960]   Thursdays and Sundays at 9 AM live.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.400]   But you can just download the thing.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:58.960]   You don't need to--
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.200]   Oh, but I think you want to listen live.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.400]   And then you want to become a knight or a producer.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.120]   A knight.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.640]   I want to be a knight.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.480]   Well, we've been wondering when you're--
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.440]   How much to be a knight?
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.680]   $1,000.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.680]   Once or--
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.440]   Is it not going--
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440]   No, just once when then you're a knight.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.720]   Forever?
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.120]   Or is it a year like--
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:14.800]   No, no, no.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.120]   It's not a subscription knight.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:16.800]   Is that a ceremony?
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.280]   I want to be a knight.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.120]   Knights of knight.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.320]   You don't need to be a knight.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:19.960]   You can't take your--
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.160]   I've been demanding that we find some processes
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.680]   that remove knights from the round table.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.680]   But--
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.960]   Because it's getting big now.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.800]   Oh, a lot of knights.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.080]   It's quite a few.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.920]   So you have a variety of different donation levels.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.560]   Knight is the highest.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.800]   No, knight is an accumulate.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.800]   You could do whatever you want.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.360]   There's knighthood layaway.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.360]   We have a knight in layaway.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.840]   Yes, this is true.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.440]   It takes 20 months at $50 a month.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.640]   Has anybody successfully completed the night of layaway?
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.960]   Actually about 25 or 30 people.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.880]   Really?
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.720]   Yeah, we can't with the layaway idea because--
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.280]   Sweet.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:55.800]   It's a lot.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.240]   It's $1,000 all at once.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.800]   Yeah, some people can't afford it.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.680]   Although most of our listeners are extremely wealthy
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.320]   and extremely intelligent.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.200]   And many of them just have quite--
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.680]   they're usually pretty wealthy.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.240]   Do I get-- I'm going to become a knight.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.120]   I want to give you a fact.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.600]   I'll write you a check before I leave.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.600]   OK.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.800]   Do I get any-- do I like to get it where a special badge?
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.080]   By the end of this year, we still have our knight rings.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:19.920]   I want a ring.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:20.960]   I love a ring.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.000]   And then next year, we're dropping the rings.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.680]   Oh, so I should get it now.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.520]   Before January 1st, yes.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.360]   I want the ring.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.320]   What does it look like?
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.080]   I don't have one.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.160]   It's got to have a decoder or a small thing.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.640]   It's a signet ring.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.840]   Is it made of metal?
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.280]   Yeah, it's backwards.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.440]   And we give you some wax--
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.160]   We have ceiling wax.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.840]   Yeah, so you can wax a seal.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.440]   And everyone, so we get a letter with one of these seals on it.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.480]   It says so cool.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.440]   Nice.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.120]   It's a serious stuff.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.640]   It's a very interesting business model.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.880]   That's all I can say.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.000]   You have to take it seriously.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.520]   Here's John Orlan's sneak peek at the Yahoo homepage design.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.480]   Let's see.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.040]   It looks like-- oh, I'm not going to say it.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.960]   Well, look at that.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.960]   Look at Jack Crunchy.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.960]   It looks just like Google.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.160]   And they even have a-- yeah, I'm feeling lucky.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.280]   That looks good, I feel lucky.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.720]   That's clean.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.240]   Man.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:12.960]   Just stealing.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.560]   You know, the funny thing was, Yahoo started out that way.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.800]   If you remember, back far enough, it was clean as a whistle.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.680]   And it was-- yes.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.880]   No, no, I--
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.920]   Yeah, it was actually like Google.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.520]   It had nothing going on.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.680]   It had-- no, no, no, because it had categories.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.160]   The category and stuff, right?
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   It always had categories.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.440]   Yeah, it had a little bit, but it was really clean compared--
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.800]   it wasn't dead bare.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.400]   Mess.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.720]   But it was just a little category
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.480]   so you could-- because it used to be a catalog.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:36.880]   People are leaving.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.800]   I'm going to move on.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.640]   I don't blame them.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640]   They're walking out.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.720]   We gave you beer.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.480]   Oh, that's what--
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.800]   they came to their senses.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.720]   Let's not all crowd the bathroom at once.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.640]   We're going to talk right now about backup done right.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.040]   We're going to talk about--
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:50.640]   say it with me--
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.480]   Carboneite, Carminite's online backup.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.680]   That's automatic.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.120]   Well, did you have the wrong one up there?
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:57.600]   Did I throw?
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.040]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.560]   Carbonite, that's what we're talking about.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.400]   That's right.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.600]   I'm doing a amount of order.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:03.880]   I warned you.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.200]   I said I might do a amount of order
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.520]   because I'm feeling kind of wacky.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.080]   I thought I chose the right one.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.000]   I didn't.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.400]   Carbonite is the best kind of backup.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.040]   It's automatic, so you don't have to remember it.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.360]   It's continuous.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.000]   So when you change a document, John's writing a column.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.520]   You don't want to like type, type, type, type, type,
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.720]   get up, have a cup of coffee, and it's gone.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.240]   And your backup's now a week old.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.160]   No, you want to have it backed up right now
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.640]   so you can get back to work.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.960]   That's what Carbonite does.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.480]   Whenever you're online, it's backing up automatically,
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.880]   continuously uses SSL so you can use it anywhere,
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.720]   even including kind of a sketch open Wi-Fi access spot.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.360]   Any coffee shop, any hotel, it's completely secure.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.120]   In fact, there's even trust no one encryption you can use
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.920]   with Carbonite.com.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.560]   If you decide only you have the key,
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.640]   if you decide you really want to protect yourself
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.840]   and your privacy.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:56.400]   And all of this, Mac or PC, less than $5 a month,
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.840]   $59 a year per computer.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.200]   That is a great deal.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.120]   You can even get your data anytime.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.960]   You can log on-- it's cloud storage.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.840]   So you can log on to your Carbonite account
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.840]   at any computer.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.520]   They have Smartphone, free Smartphone apps,
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.560]   free tablet apps, and there's your stuff.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.160]   They do have Home Office, Small Business, and other plans.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.440]   You can take a look at those.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.520]   But no matter what, if you want to try it for free,
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.640]   just go to Carbonite.com and use our offer code TWIT.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.040]   And you could try it without a credit card free for two weeks.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.680]   I do encourage you to do that because it, of course,
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.400]   depends upon your bandwidth.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.200]   So you have to have a sufficient upstream bandwidth
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:29.720]   and all of that.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:30.960]   But you don't try it.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.680]   It's very polite.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.800]   Doesn't get in the way.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.800]   Doesn't use up your bandwidth if it sees you're busy or the internet
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.320]   is busy.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.240]   It just backs down and only backs up when you're not busy.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.400]   I think you're going to really like this.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.960]   If you decide to buy it, use TWIT again as the offer code
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.640]   and you'll get two months free, 14 months for the price of 12,
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.320]   makes it an even better deal.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.640]   You got to back it up, please.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.720]   You got to back it up to get it back, so do it right with Carbonite.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.200]   I had a call on the radio show two weeks ago.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.000]   A guy was sailing on Catalina Island in his laptop fell over board.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.200]   And he said, everything was on the laptop.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.440]   Thank god I had Carbonite because I didn't lose my data.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.520]   But somewhere at the bottom of the ocean in the Catalina Island,
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.760]   there's his laptop.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.520]   What are you doing these days, Robert Heron?
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.280]   Did you see this story about Japanese television companies?
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.200]   Well, Sharp is what kind of prompted all of this.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.520]   Sharp is practically bankrupt.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.360]   They were able to get it alone from Han High from the company
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.200]   that makes a lot of Apple products in China.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.800]   If you look at all of the major HDTV manufacturers,
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.440]   and for the last few years, there are very few of them
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.160]   that actually make a profit on television.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.000]   I was shocked to hear them.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.320]   I can think of one.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.880]   One company and their profit margin was less than 2%.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.920]   And that's not a very profitable industry.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.120]   And if you look at how pricing goes in the retail channels,
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.800]   there is no profit to be had for the people selling the TVs
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.160]   either.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.320]   So you have companies like Take Best Buy, for example.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.400]   They're on the ropes.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.480]   Because the market's just so thin, nobody's making money on this.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   And so even with the extreme integration for some companies
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.720]   like Take a Samsung in particular or Sharp,
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.040]   they're making the chips, the panels, every stinkin' part
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.120]   that goes into it.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.000]   And yet they're barely trying a profit.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.160]   So I thought, oh, what Samsung and LG
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.520]   are eating Sharp, Panasonic, and Sony alive.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.880]   But they're not even doing that well.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.000]   To my knowledge, most of the TV manufacturers
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.280]   haven't made a profit in about seven, five to seven years.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.000]   Holy cow.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.320]   Some are taking losses and measured in the billions.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.160]   A lot of them are.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.520]   And it's the other companies, the other products
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.200]   that they have in their line.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.480]   Mobile displays tend to pay for the big screens that we all love.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.720]   So selling lots of tiny displays at an extreme profit
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.880]   works out a lot better for them.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.520]   And in the case of Sharp, they're also
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.680]   banking on the fact that they're solar technology, which
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:50.160]   is manufactured very similar to how LCD panels are manufactured.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.200]   They're number one, just about in the world.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.160]   I can't think of a better company in terms of technology
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.400]   for solar panels.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.040]   And that could be their saving grace going forward.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.080]   They have some of the best facilities in the world
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.000]   to make thin film transistors that go into LCD screens
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.960]   and the same tech that goes into solar panels as well.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.560]   So they need that $4 billion plus loan right now,
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.240]   just to float them along until hopefully the market and everything
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.160]   turns around for them.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.360]   It's kind of an amazing number.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.760]   $4 billion.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.040]   You borrowed $4 billion.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.640]   But you look at the scale of these facilities.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.360]   And these are measured in how many football fields
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.640]   and how many stories high.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.000]   And the average facility is on the scale of about six
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.960]   to eight football fields big.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.880]   And then times that by four to five stories high.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.680]   And just extreme amounts of engineering and technology
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.320]   that go into producing this stuff.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.160]   It's not cheap to do.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.040]   And the last few years have just been
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.720]   difficult for all of these folks.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.920]   Sony apparently is looking at medical technology.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.880]   Anywhere you can basically get a display
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.160]   and charge a premium for it.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:51.760]   And in those markets too, it's a lot easier to charge more
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.320]   in business to business transactions
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.400]   than it would be to sell to--
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.760]   And who would it take the same words you spend all their time
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.200]   looking for the best deal to begin with?
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.960]   Sony is talking to Olympus asking them to take a $633 million
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.200]   stake in Sony.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.560]   Sony is talking to Olympus saying,
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.360]   would you please, would you buy some of us?
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.240]   That's weird.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.040]   So is it-- so Robert, is it the margins or low,
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.880]   or is it that we aren't buying the TVs?
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.240]   We are buying them, aren't we?
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:15.680]   We are.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.800]   And the sales are continuing.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.640]   But there is no profit to be had.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.560]   So unless you are one of the biggest of the manufacturers--
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.400]   How could that happen?
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.000]   Why are they charging so little?
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.040]   Why don't they charge more?
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.800]   So they can make-- I mean, isn't that bad business?
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.880]   It's also a game, two, two.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.040]   Well, one, we've been going through the price fixing
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.000]   scandals for the last decade.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.600]   Everybody was involved in that.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.000]   And they've all come to pay their fines for that up
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.840]   to continue to this day.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:45.000]   Also, I have to say that it really comes down to--
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.760]   if you can't make money doing this,
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.480]   then you have to look at what else can you
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.240]   do to keep the company going.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.360]   And the display technology, like I said, yeah,
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.200]   the big screen TVs, if you look at where
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.920]   the companies are shifting now to where they're
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:00.800]   putting their efforts, it's into the most premium models
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.480]   that they can get a 50% margin on, say.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.720]   The new largest LCD screens, like Sharps' new 80-inch screen
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.480]   or 90-inch screen, if they can charge $11,000 for a 90-inch
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:10.840]   screen--
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.160]   That's a high margin item.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.360]   That's-- you're going to make a few bucks more than selling,
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.280]   say, four or 60-inch panels at barely making--
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.920]   So I sharp bought the elite line and the elite engineers
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.920]   from Panasonic, hoping that they could do a high margin product.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.960]   Slee, they bought that name more than the engineers.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:26.960]   But they--
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.560]   Well, their name is not enough.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.520]   You got to have the--
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.760]   So Sony's buying Olympus.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.360]   No.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.960]   That's what it says here.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.720]   Oh, they want to acquire Olympus for their endoscopes
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:37.680]   and the other technology.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.000]   All right.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:38.500]   OK.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.160]   I misread that.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.400]   I thought it was the other way around.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.200]   And Sony got out of manufacturing displays for a while.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.120]   And I'm not sure if they are recovered yet in terms
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.440]   of actually having their own manufacturing capabilities.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.200]   For LCDs or--
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.440]   I don't think they're out of plasma.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.360]   So it's clearly, though, price pressure from Samsung LG
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.400]   and then companies like Vizio and Huawei
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.840]   and some of the--
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.360]   Those kind of cheaper companies have really put price pressure
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.000]   on these higher end.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.600]   It's only, but--
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.360]   The Vizio's of the world use those other companies
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.480]   you mentioned, their panels, to build their own.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.400]   So--
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.840]   Doesn't Samsung just basically own the business?
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.280]   Pretty much.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.280]   They make the panels and now they're moving into OLEDs.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.640]   And people, it says in some of these articles,
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.320]   can't tell the difference between the slightly better
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.880]   Panasonic or Sharp or the Japanese displays
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.480]   compared to the Samsungs.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.160]   So they do buy the Samsung.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.520]   It's when you're standing there in the store that--
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.480]   Doesn't look that different.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.080]   No, they really don't.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.920]   But you test these.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.280]   Do they really have an advantage?
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:31.920]   Of course.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:33.720]   Sharp Sony and Panasonic are better.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.680]   Right now.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.480]   If I had to go buy one.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:35.960]   20,000--
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:35.960]   20,000--
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.960]   --about a VT50.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.000]   Yeah, I'd say the Panasonic VT50.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.080]   Or if you had to go Samsung.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   I'm not so stupid as I would.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.120]   Yes, 8,000.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:43.960]   Really?
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.840]   The 10 plas--
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.640]   You're saying the Samsung is as good as the Panasonic?
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.440]   I like Panasonic more because of what they're doing internally.
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.040]   And now this is just a plasma?
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.400]   They have-- you can now control--
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.160]   That's low power plasmas than new.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.560]   Well, they're lower than California's.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:57.920]   The new one's just a--
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.400]   It's all kind of a joke.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.200]   You think it's a bunch of bull crap.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.320]   Out of the box, it will have a low power consumption in me.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.840]   But you're going to get a car to advance.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.840]   But that's always the problem.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.040]   Yeah, when you put it into a mode,
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.240]   you actually want to watch.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.440]   And then it's all out the door.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.560]   But--
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.040]   But it's not that expensive.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.680]   So the Panasonic VT--
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.200]   Those things are like 1,000 bucks on me.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.240]   We're talking at 4,000.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.400]   The VT50.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.640]   35, 99, for 65.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.400]   65 inches, exactly.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.680]   But if I don't want 65 inches, I want 55.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.560]   What's the 55?
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:25.960]   500 likes.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:26.840]   2 grand?
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:27.280]   2 grand?
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   Really?
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:27.800]   That one?
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.160]   I want to say I could look it up.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.240]   That's what I get.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:30.760]   They're nice.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.600]   No, you want big, John.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:31.800]   Why?
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.280]   I like that.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:32.600]   If you're a big guy.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.520]   I have a projector.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.480]   I use my projector.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.440]   All right, there you go.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.800]   I've got 100 inch, boom.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.640]   I pull it down.
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:38.160]   Whap.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:38.400]   Like--
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.240]   Supposing the new--
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.000]   The new Epson--
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:41.600]   what is it?
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.440]   Sinema Link projector?
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.360]   Very nice for $2,000.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.040]   They're saying good things about it.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.320]   LG's got a cool new projector that
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.880]   has a built-in DTV tuner, but they won't send it out to anyone
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.400]   for review.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.440]   So it's probably not--
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.120]   Why would you want a built-in tuner?
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.240]   Football.
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.840]   Like, you could just take it out in the backyard,
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.320]   put an antenna on it, and boom.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:57.760]   You're watching--
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.760]   Put an antenna on it.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.040]   Well, that's modern.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.520]   The antenna.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.240]   That's the few.
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:02.600]   Right?
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:02.920]   It is.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:03.360]   Or you--
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.240]   No, I literally have--
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.520]   Do you use a UHF single--
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:05.880]   You could--
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.240]   But you get a big double bow tie thing in Solob?
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.320]   Double bow tie.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.200]   Or you get one of the new--
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.480]   I got some catwishers for you.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:11.920]   Wall pants are--
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.440]   I got an antenna for the link.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.080]   You turn the knob, and it tunes it.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:15.800]   It's incredible.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.040]   Yeah, I bet.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.520]   Hey, why don't you get a repeater?
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.920]   Why don't we get some wins--
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.560]   I love my over here.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.720]   The wins system repeater and Petaluma.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.160]   So we go--
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.880]   You have one on the mountain over here in San Francisco.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.160]   I try can't hit it with it.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.800]   I had the little portable device.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.640]   I tried a little--
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.400]   I came last-- when I was here two weeks ago,
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.080]   I brought the little portable--
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:33.880]   Whatever.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:34.800]   You like the winces thing?
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.960]   That's what you do?
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.920]   It's nice.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.760]   They got a little-- they got some guys on there.
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.600]   We got the D star, the APRS.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.760]   We got some good digital stuff.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.680]   So here's the deal.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.040]   Winces system is weird, because it uses the internet.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.160]   No, no, that's the other one.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:46.960]   That's D star?
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.600]   No, that's the old one.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.320]   Somebody knows what it is.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.320]   But anyway, here's the deal.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.440]   You've got the gear.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.200]   You've got like a--
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.120]   I've got the best gear.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.440]   I have the best handle.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.680]   You can money this.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.600]   You have to buy this.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.040]   But actually, what you really have--
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:00.760]   No antenna.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.280]   No, here's what you're--
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.840]   But what you really have, because you've
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.640]   got the little pot thing, and you've
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:12.320]   got the giant AM transmitter, why don't we
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:16.840]   make a-- do a separate deal and get an AM station going out
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:21.680]   of this spot and play all the Twitch stuff 24/7 on AM radio?
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:25.080]   And people all over Petaluma could hear it.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.640]   But get some firepower.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:28.600]   Get some firepower.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.800]   Get 50,000 watts.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.720]   You can get down to the bay.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.560]   You get a 50,000 watt license.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.480]   You can shoot right down the bay.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.000]   For AM, right down to the bay.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.560]   You can hit San Jose from here.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.520]   Boom, that would be huge.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.360]   In Mexico, it would be huge.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.920]   It could be like Wolfman Jack of Tech.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.440]   All right, babies, I want you all to go to your window.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.520]   Everybody in my family has told me to pester
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.000]   about this concept, because it's--
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.560]   Everybody in your family wants to be done.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.360]   Everybody in your family wants to be
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.880]   started a radio-- an AM radio station.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.360]   Yes.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.080]   What is wrong with your family?
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.160]   They've been listening to classical music day in and day.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.360]   It's never podcasting.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.560]   Well, we've got no cockroaches, though.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.400]   No cockroaches?
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.480]   You got to hear it.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.440]   You have a transmitter sitting over there.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.320]   Here's what I really want to do.
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.160]   I want to get a boat.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.000]   Go out beyond the international limit, which is now
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   going to be hundreds of miles, thanks to our government.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   I can't go without.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.960]   But then I could do a pirate radio station.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.480]   You can do a real radio station.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:21.880]   There's so much space now, because these guys are going out
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.080]   of business left and right, the opportunity
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.600]   to have a real AM radio station pumping 50,000 watts
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:29.640]   down the gut.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.840]   I got an idea.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.840]   I could just go like this.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.320]   Hopefully he'll think about this.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.040]   And then people could play it, and they would have no cockroaches.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.400]   I think you're not taking a suggestion seriously.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.800]   You used to be supporters.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:46.960]   Here's the deal.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   You're going to have these podcasts.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.560]   You get 400,000 people max.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.360]   You get on one of these big flame throwers,
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.160]   and you can have a million people listening to you.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   At the spur of the moment, you can have them take action.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.600]   You do know that I'm on 180 radio stations nationwide,
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.400]   six hours a week.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.520]   You don't like the idea?
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.280]   No, I do it already.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.600]   Yeah, but this is your own AM station.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.440]   You can, by the way, syndicate yourself.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.760]   You would have to pay the 25 bucks or whatever it is.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.400]   Renvera has been calling.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.560]   John was watching very full volume again.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.200]   Pump up the volume.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.440]   Got to fight the powers of peace.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.920]   OK.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.800]   We're going to take a break, because I'm--
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.320]   Did we just take a break a minute ago?
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:24.920]   Did we?
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.480]   They're nodding.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:28.960]   The audience is going, yay.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.840]   You just took a break.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.280]   All right, I'll move on.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.440]   Facebook does not have 65 and a half, 63 and a half million
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.520]   active users in China.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.920]   Just thought I'd let you know.
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:39.920]   Huh.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.840]   Somebody said they--
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.280]   That was completely buffalode by that.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.440]   Somebody said they did.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.480]   A new report published this week suggests China
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.200]   is Twitter's largest global market,
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:51.600]   and that Facebook has 63 and a half million users,
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.880]   despite both being blocked by the country's internet censorship
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.560]   system.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.920]   I know.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.080]   According to information from Facebook and other sources,
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.760]   this is almost certainly wrong.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:04.880]   It came from e-marketer.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:09.360]   That's a well-respected, well-read source.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.800]   It does seem a little odd.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.080]   Do you see one stat that I thought
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.200]   was interesting this week that you could read about on All Things
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:18.680]   D?
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:19.200]   Yes.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.880]   And my fellow reporter Mike Isaac
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.520]   was that Instagram actually had more daily usage than Twitter.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.040]   Twitter.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.480]   In August, I think.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.480]   Oh, look out.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.600]   You know, Trey Rakos has been saying this.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.680]   The great photographer has been saying this for a while,
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:37.200]   that we are becoming less, more non-verbal and more--
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.920]   it's easier to communicate in a photograph
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:40.360]   than 140 characters.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.000]   And I think it's true that we take pictures,
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.520]   and that really has become a real form,
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.800]   a medium of communication.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.840]   I mean, you don't have to think of something witty, you know?
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.200]   Right.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.400]   Capture your surroundings and put a filter on it.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.280]   Or you take a witty picture, and that speaks 1,000 words.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.240]   I have a witty picture.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:54.440]   I just--
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:54.960]   Yeah, you didn't--
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.440]   I just told you.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.280]   --really.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.040]   You don't even need to translate pictures.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:58.920]   Let me see if I can find them.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.040]   Every language.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.200]   It speaks to everyone.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.920]   Here's-- I posted this on Instagram.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:05.680]   That's not it.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.160]   My photos.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.920]   Let me just see if I can find it here.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.280]   I think this is a witty picture.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.120]   What do you think?
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.560]   Let me show you the big version of it.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.800]   OK.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:22.400]   So it's a couple posing in front of a plane wreck.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:22.960]   Oh.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.320]   That's witty.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:24.520]   It is?
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.800]   Were you at a plane wreck?
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.360]   No.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.000]   It's Universal Studios.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.320]   It's a fake plane wreck.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.600]   Oh, it's a one-- yeah.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.320]   It says Steven Spielberg's.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:33.840]   They left it.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.560]   It was from Word of the Worlds.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.520]   He bought a 747 used for 747 on a--
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.520]   from like a scrap metal dealer.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.000]   If you've--
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.320]   Outside of Las Vegas, there's a field full of these things.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.120]   And Mojave Desert.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.160]   And they chopped it up.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.600]   And they set it up.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.320]   And it's actually a very--
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.200]   it's kind of an amazing thing to come upon.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.480]   There's smoke coming out of it.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.640]   There's destroyed houses behind it and everything.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.080]   What was your caption?
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.840]   No, it was Winnie by itself.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.360]   No caption.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.240]   I thought you said that you left the right one.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.960]   This is the smiling couple in the carnage.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.840]   I think it just says that a lot of things speaks to itself.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:07.760]   Now, here's the thing--
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.200]   I think it's a winner.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.160]   Here's the thing.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.520]   There's people that live up here on the ridge
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.280]   overlooking this.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.400]   This is just out in the open?
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.040]   Yes.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.160]   This is their view.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:17.840]   Oh, wonderful.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.080]   It's a 747 wreck.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:19.560]   And it's huge.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.840]   It's like a couple of acres.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.480]   I would complain about this if I lived there.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.840]   Apparently, when they first set it up,
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.840]   pilots flying over it on the way to L.A.A.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:27.800]   We'd phone in.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.920]   Hey, we got a plane down.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.720]   Someone in the chat room wants to know if you can see it
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:32.880]   on Google Maps.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.840]   I'm sure you can, of course.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.520]   If somebody would send me the link,
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.400]   I will see--
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.040]   I wonder if you could see this couple posing.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:39.800]   What about on Apple?
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.800]   That couple.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.880]   Are they frozen in time this couple?
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.680]   They're actually fake.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.240]   Oh, OK.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:45.800]   That makes me sense.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.840]   That's moving magic that's happening right there.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.640]   I probably should have gotten the permission of that couple
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.400]   before I posted this.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.320]   That's public place.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.320]   There we go.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:00.960]   Google killing more things.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.240]   There's persistent rumor that they're
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.720]   going to kill Feedburner.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:06.960]   I don't know how that will happen,
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.840]   because so many people use Feedburner.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.000]   That if they kill--
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.600]   Well, they killed AdSense for Feeds, which was Feedburner's
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.480]   monetization product that became a Google product.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.920]   So that means write Feedburner's next.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.320]   I don't think it's interesting about that, though.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.880]   Is that Twitter basically killed RSS,
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.360]   and Dick Costola is the CEO of Twitter.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:25.720]   Yes.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.400]   Was the CEO Feedburner?
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.600]   How interesting.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.560]   He's eating himself.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.680]   He's like, orobus.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.240]   Oroborobus.
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.320]   How do you say that?
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.320]   A robobor.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.320]   Oroborus?
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:35.720]   Orobor.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.400]   Thank you.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.040]   Is it?
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.280]   Yeah, the snake that eats itself.
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:38.720]   Oh.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:39.760]   Oroborus.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.200]   Huh.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:41.680]   Yummy.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.640]   Google announced it's shuttering AdSense for Feeds.
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.120]   That was so that you could put ads in your RSS feeds.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.560]   We were talking about how easy AdSense was to use.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:52.400]   That closes December 3.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.760]   People keep waiting for the other shooter to drop.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.760]   You think Feedburner's really going to get shuttered?
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.080]   That doesn't make sense.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.840]   Everybody thinks it's going to happen.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.920]   Well, that would be-- they would get--
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:04.520]   I don't think they can do that.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.120]   And why don't they--
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.360]   They can do something just like open source or make it--
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.000]   That's what I have to say.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.040]   Why don't you throw stuff into the open source community.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.040]   I've seen you already.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.360]   Yeah, just throw it out.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.320]   There it is.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.560]   On Google Maps-- oops.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.520]   I just moved away from it.
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.040]   Let's go back.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.040]   Oh.
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.320]   That's what you see from the air.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.040]   Doesn't look anything like an actual wreck.
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.400]   Have they shot other movies there?
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.800]   Like, is this--
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.480]   I don't know.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.320]   They leave it there.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.440]   See, there's a couple of the engines?
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.520]   It does look like lost, doesn't it?
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.720]   And then there's these people up on the ridge.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.000]   And these are, by the way, these are very fancy houses
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.120]   up here on the ridge.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.920]   They're looking down over the--
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.000]   kind of view.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.600]   That's the view to die for.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.200]   Literally.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.840]   Literally.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.880]   What's that out your window?
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.360]   My god, there's a plane down now.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.000]   No, it's just Universal Studios.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.560]   Have you heard the riddle about how there's people--
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.120]   like 50 people dead in a cabin in the woods.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:57.080]   What happened?
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:57.440]   What happened?
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.600]   It was a plane crash.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:30:59.360]   That's the riddle?
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:30:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.600]   Well, usually it takes you a couple hours of asking
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.560]   questions to get there.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.920]   Well, you just spoiled it, right?
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.240]   I'm going to say, after that, I have to take a break.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.680]   Squarespace.com, the secret behind the best websites
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:12.080]   in the world.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:15.560]   I often wonder, we go to websites all the time and crash them.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:19.400]   And I often wonder, why are they on the Squarespace?
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:22.400]   Because I tell you, it's just you cannot bring on Squarespace.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   You cannot bring on Squarespace.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.000]   You know, we have a website, the knowagendashow.com.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:26.960]   Is that on Squarespace?
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:27.920]   Yes, it's on Squarespace.
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.600]   All right, let's see if we can bring it down.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.120]   OK.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.360]   There are thousands of people.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.000]   I think we have a couple of thousand people in the chat
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   room.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.040]   There's probably eight or 9,000 people watching.
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:39.120]   If all of you right now go to knowagendashow.com.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.440]   Let's just everybody go there.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.840]   Let's see if we can bring the site down.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.800]   Just pound it as hard as you can.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.360]   Look, it's still snappy and fast.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.440]   We've got to come on.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.680]   Come on, people.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.400]   I beg of you.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.160]   Get over there.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.640]   No, it's not even slowing down.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.320]   This is not good.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:54.160]   It's not good.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:54.880]   It's good.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.160]   It is good.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.160]   Squarespace.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.240]   It's really good.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.360]   What's the thing where you can see your live web traffic?
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360]   Do you have that on?
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.440]   You have this stats for your site.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:04.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:05.920]   What's the--
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:06.760]   Chartbeat's great.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:07.720]   Can you pull up your Chartbeat account?
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.000]   I don't have a Chartbeat account.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.560]   John, what do I want a Chartbeat account for?
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.280]   That shows you how many people are on your site
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.280]   right at that moment.
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.360]   Oh, that would have been cool.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.880]   Did you know that your site is automatically mobilized?
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.320]   They use responsive design, so you don't even
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.000]   have to worry about it.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.240]   When you put images on there, it automatically
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:26.280]   generates seven versions, one for each size,
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.400]   so that even from the smallest to the biggest screen,
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.400]   you'll be able to-- you'll get exactly--
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.200]   your people get exactly the same site.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.200]   They'll know what they're going to get.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:34.800]   Did you know that?
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.000]   It's an amazing thing.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.480]   It's astonishing, actually.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.800]   You know, and Squarespace, I like the confidence
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.040]   of a company that says, just try it for free.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.000]   I don't want a credit card.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.440]   I don't want any personal information.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.840]   Just go to squarespace.com.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.360]   Click the Try It free button.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.000]   You've got to give them an email address
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.320]   so you can recover your password.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.000]   Your name of your site and a password.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.500]   And that's it.
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:54.960]   And now for two weeks, you can use everything
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.240]   on the Squarespace site.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.960]   You could try the responsive designs, the 50-plus designer
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.280]   templates.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.360]   The stats are great.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.120]   I mean, amazing stats.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:08.080]   All the import from existing blog sites like Blogger
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:11.400]   and TypePad and WordPress.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.800]   But you can also export out so you're never trapped.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.160]   Google Maps integration, you don't
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.360]   have to use that crappy Apple Maps.
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.880]   Use the Google Maps integration.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.440]   It's just beautiful.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.760]   I want you to try it free right now.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:23.080]   Don't even use the offer code.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.480]   Just go to squarespace and give it a try.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.000]   If you decide you want to buy, I'll
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.400]   tell you why you want our offer code,

[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.880]   Now, if you go to the pricing and take a look,
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.800]   they have monthly and also annual.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.040]   You'll get a bit more bang for your buck on the annual plan,
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.760]   because you're going to get 10% off of that.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.640]   And the annual plans include something very nice,
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.880]   a custom domain.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.320]   So if you've got a .com.org.net.biz or .info name in mind,
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.120]   you haven't registered it yet.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.160]   They'll register for it, you for it,
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.960]   and hook it up to the Squarespace site for free.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.360]   So like know, agenda show .com.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:58.560]   Boom, it just goes there.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.120]   How's it going?
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.880]   Is it still refreshing?
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:03.480]   Have we killed the site?
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.600]   No, we can't kill it.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:06.640]   Can't kill it.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.520]   It is-- look at that.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.120]   Snappy.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:09.920]   You know why?
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:11.080]   Right now, we don't even know it,
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.600]   but the guys at Squarespace are flipping switches
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.760]   to put more bandwidth.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.400]   More bandwidth.
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:17.920]   We need more bandwidth.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.480]   More cheese.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:19.840]   Somebody's hitting the Devor Act site.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.760]   Turn on the band.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:21.760]   They just-- the engineers go.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.640]   They put more coal in the furnace.
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.240]   The turbine spin up.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.160]   Hamsters.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.320]   And it's just amazing.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.560]   They never go down.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.920]   $16 a month.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:31.800]   And look what you get.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:32.880]   Unlimited pages.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.880]   Unlimited bandwidth.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:35.160]   I don't know.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.520]   Anybody does this.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.280]   Unlimited storage.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.120]   You can have as many contributors as you want.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:43.720]   So it's great for a professional magazine or whatever.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:46.640]   And all of that for $16 a month when you buy the annual plan.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.640]   They also have an $8 a month plan.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.680]   But you're going to get 10% off that first purchase
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.120]   no matter what you buy.
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.600]   If you use the offer code TWIT9, that's all I ask is that if you decide to buy TWIT9,
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.760]   but do do the free site.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.360]   And we asked him.
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.000]   And we said, do you mind that we're-- everybody's starting sites.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.440]   And like, for one off, like I'm having a party next week,
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.720]   I'm just going to do a--
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:05.760]   And they said, no, we don't care.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:06.320]   It's fine.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.920]   Everybody start a site.
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.840]   We've got more bandwidth.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.200]   Use it up.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.480]   Squarespace.com.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.360]   Give it a try today.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.920]   I know you're going to like it.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.520]   John used it for no agenda show.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.720]   You know it's good.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.640]   Because John is a wizard web designer.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.520]   He's no dillotot when it comes to webs.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.520]   We use the templates that they provide.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.600]   Interesting article given what we were talking about.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.120]   Will TV be Apple's undoing?
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.960]   This is from fortune.cnn.com.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.880]   Yeah, I wrote a column off of this column.
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:43.400]   So then fill us in.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.000]   What's the story?
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.920]   Well, the story, I think you just misses the whole point.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:47.760]   That's what I'm thinking.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.080]   Philip Elmer DeWitt here.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.160]   Well, this is the same article I'm thinking about.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:55.960]   He says Apple-- well, actually, he refers back
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.960]   to a very interesting article by Holman Jenkins.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:01.400]   That's the one I was--
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:01.760]   Yes.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.200]   --bouncing off of it, which says-- yeah, this one.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.800]   This article by Jenkins, he goes on and on about kind
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.440]   of missing the point.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.520]   Well, God, I thought it was a very powerful article.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:13.840]   Powerful article, what he claims, it seems to me,
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.520]   is that Apple's going to lose it because this
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:20.600]   is the iTunes model is not going to work with TV.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.400]   And they're not going to do the deals, the content deals.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:26.240]   And the video business is not like the music business--
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.600]   he says this in there--
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.160]   is not like the music business that's failing.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.080]   I'm thinking this is not what Apple TV is about.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:33.680]   It's not about selling content.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.760]   It's about bringing out-- using the expensive design team
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.360]   that Apple has world class, by the way,
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.640]   consider one of the best industrial design teams
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.440]   in the world for any company.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.240]   What's-- just bring out a nice-looking TV,
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.560]   put it in the Apple store because the whole deal right now
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:48.760]   is retail stores.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.960]   Apple needs to have another product to sell.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.000]   Just have it in there.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.640]   Instead of buying your TV from Costco,
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.800]   you go to Apple store and you buy a really nice LCD.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.560]   And that's it.
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:02.440]   There's none of this sell that's just conjecture about iTunes
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.440]   is nonsense.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:05.320]   Well, what would be the point of Apple making a TV
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.880]   if they were just making a TV?
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.080]   Because they're a hardware company.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.280]   They wanted to try to make it better.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:10.080]   It would be better.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:10.600]   It would be better.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.120]   It would have integrated Apple TV within it.
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.800]   Like, isn't that the point of making--
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:15.800]   Yeah, but it--
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.280]   It's the point of you.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.240]   Well, Jenkins says that we are in a world where content
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.160]   is king, the company's business model is doomed to failure.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.160]   Yeah, because-- but this is what they've been saying
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.440]   about Apple since day one.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:29.160]   Oh, you know, they should be making software.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.680]   But look, look at-- it should be a software company.
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.160]   They're throwing themselves on the rocks
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.680]   that have killed Panasonic, Sony, and Sharp,
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.680]   not to mention Rocky for Samsung and LG.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:39.840]   This is a tough business.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.960]   Why would they want to be in that?
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.680]   There are also a whole bunch of mobile manufacturers.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.280]   I made the mistake of saying this about the smartphone,
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.120]   I might add.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.000]   I said the same thing.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.480]   I said, Apple's crazy.
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.960]   Why would you want to do business with AT&T?
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.120]   That's nuts.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.960]   It's selling apps.
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:56.160]   And some people would also like to see
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.840]   Apple just make a better TV as well.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.240]   That's what I'm thinking.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.880]   Apple is already doing very good things
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.480]   with color control and their current line of products from--
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.320]   But I think that's wishful thinking from Apple.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.360]   Yeah, iPhone 5.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:08.240]   It's not a good business strategy.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.360]   That's just Apple fans.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.080]   Look, if you've got these stores,
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.880]   you've got to sell something in these stores.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.680]   Microsoft's heading in the same direction.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.480]   That's why they're going to bring out more and more hardware.
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.880]   You're going to see a free Android-based TVs.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.320]   Android-based TVs.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.280]   Well, there's Google TV.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.720]   How many of LG does that already?
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.160]   You can put a stick now into just about any HTML.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.200]   And an HTML.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:28.880]   MHL stick.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.280]   Don't even need that.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.080]   It'll turn any TV with an HTML.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.360]   They don't have to have MHL?
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:33.880]   No.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.400]   And then you can run Android apps.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.880]   It will run-- it's a full Android computer on a stick
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.760]   that can be powered off the 5 volts coming from HDMI.
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:41.280]   Wow.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.880]   And there's about 10 people currently making these products,
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.920]   because it's like, oh, that's a great idea.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.880]   Because then you can just have the wireless built
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.560]   into the stick, the networking, everything,
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:52.400]   have a nice 4.1 experience, plug that into any TV,
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:53.400]   and add that desktop right there.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.520]   Rokus to it in the Rokus stick.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.720]   But that requires-- what is an MHL port?
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.880]   That's a powered--
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:58.760]   All that describes.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.240]   That's right.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.560]   It's HDMI that it's port agnostic.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:04.800]   It could be over--
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.560]   it looks like a USB connector.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.080]   So on one end, you could have USB-2 HDMI.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.920]   And the MHL is the transport link between them.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.280]   It really has nothing to do with that.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.920]   So all modern HDMI ports that have
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.400]   this capabilities, what you're saying.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.240]   All the new TVs are MHL enabled,
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.720]   so you wouldn't need a converter product.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.280]   It stands for Mobile High Definition Link.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.280]   Exactly.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:25.480]   So what's cool is this--
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:26.640]   Well, this is what you just described.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.940]   Now Rokus not--
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:29.160]   Rokus not--
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.280]   Yeah, all these phones are--
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.200]   USB-2 John.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:31.760]   That's MHL.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:33.600]   Mini USB-2 HDMI.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.640]   You get a USB-2 HDMI.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.240]   You can talk it out through the hole here.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.400]   You can talk through the hole.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:37.920]   It works good.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.060]   And if you have a Samsung TV, you
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.560]   can just push one button and you can picture them.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.400]   Into, out of.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.480]   It already works really well.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.120]   Onto your TV.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.220]   But actually, you probably would
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.520]   want to use DLNA or some sort of wireless technology.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.520]   That works really well already.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.240]   Instead of doing a big HDMI connector on here.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:51.280]   But what's cool is the idea--
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.520]   A big HDMI connector.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:53.020]   You got it.
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:53.920]   There only this big.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.040]   Oh, you got to have a little USB to HDMI.
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:56.720]   Then HDMI--
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.400]   It's all wires coming out of your phone.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:39:58.920]   That's crazy.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:39:59.400]   There are wires.
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:39:59.920]   You can't--
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.720]   It's crazy having these wires.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.120]   But John, you can get a Roku.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.080]   You-- it looks like a USB--
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:05.840]   No, no, no, I know.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.880]   I want to get one of those.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.800]   Plugs into your HDMI port.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.740]   And now, as you said, it's not Android,
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:13.100]   but it gives you all the Roku capabilities on a TV.
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:13.980]   Totally.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:15.740]   There's a couple of Kickstarter projects
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:18.500]   that I've invested in that are doing this very thing right now.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.940]   Pocket TV is one of them.
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:22.100]   And the other one-- I basically just invested in all.
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.460]   They're like $70 products that are coming down the line right now.
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:27.460]   And as soon as one of these appeared,
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:28.420]   it seemed like everyone--
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.620]   I like it that you say you're investing.
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:30.980]   You don't get anything from them.
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:31.900]   I want to stand that.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.900]   I like the--
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:33.780]   I like the investing moniker.
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.620]   You might not even get a product.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:36.300]   I may not do it.
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.260]   You're a backup.
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:38.060]   But they're on version two.
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:38.960]   And they're keeping me updated.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.000]   So I have a--
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:40.920]   You're a backer.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.400]   Yeah, you should say you're a backer.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.000]   And you shouldn't ever brought up that.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:44.840]   You should just make it sell.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.560]   So this was the Pocket TV.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.520]   It was-- they were asking for $100,000.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:50.600]   They raised half a million.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.360]   A thumb-sized computer.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.920]   Just got an update recently.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.160]   They've stepped it up with more internal storage,
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.040]   a faster processor.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.920]   And they basically redesigned the whole damn thing from--
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:58.920]   Right.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:59.680]   That's not me.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:00.520]   It's delayed.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:01.520]   Of course.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.360]   So it's-- but they're on.
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.400]   You've got to figure it out.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.040]   Does it worry you that it's by a company from Dubai
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.560]   called Infinitec?
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:08.040]   Not at all.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:08.540]   OK.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.620]   I'm wondering why somebody didn't do this sooner.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.540]   So now you've got to be jumping on it.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:14.860]   But it was bringing back to the point--
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.820]   if you're going to have Android TVs,
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:19.380]   that's kind of a more Wild West environment
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:20.700]   for software and applications.
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:24.020]   And I have to go west the one thing it does well is I'll
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:25.340]   hand iOS to my mom.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:25.980]   And you know what?
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:28.420]   I feel fairly safe giving her that environment to play.
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:30.060]   And there's not a lot that she can totally
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:31.180]   torch a system with.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:36.820]   But you think you could destroy a TV for malware?
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:37.620]   Sure.
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.000]   It would be instantly attacked.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.040]   I mean, you have to assume that's going to happen.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.040]   That's not a good idea.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.980]   Well, no, but hopefully the operating system
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:45.320]   has some built-in good defenses.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.880]   And you can protect your Android device nowadays
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.080]   with applications.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:52.440]   Or if you don't open it up to rooting and all the other good
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440]   stuff, you're saving yourself some potential.
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.960]   It is the thing that bugs me about Apple TV.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.000]   If we could just buy apps.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.280]   If I could just put HBO Go on an Apple TV--
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.880]   Well, I have a Roku.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.200]   And you can basically do that.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.200]   It's just that no one has all the content yet, right?
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.280]   Because Netflix started doing really well.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.140]   So then now--
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:10.820]   They pulled all the content from Netflix.
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:14.320]   But it would be fine with what I currently have now,
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.700]   just with everything, with all the content I could want.
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:19.740]   But the system itself doesn't bother me.
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:22.100]   Like, you know, I mean, typing with one of those remotes
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.380]   is terrible, but that's OK.
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:25.260]   No, but then your Apple mobile device
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:27.200]   becomes your keyboard or the voice.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:29.100]   You could talk to Siri and it's just going to appear on the
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:29.940]   screen.
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:30.300]   I don't know.
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:31.700]   Maybe my imagination is not right.
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:33.100]   But I'll close up what I would want.
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.900]   That kind of dopey round ball that--
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:36.800]   Cue.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.200]   Well, that's not happening now.
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:38.700]   Dead Cue.
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.220]   Well, that's a good thing.
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.740]   I mean, we finally hooked the thing up.
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.460]   It doesn't do anything.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.980]   But you can talk to it with your Android devices.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:46.900]   You can type away--
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:48.620]   And fight each other to control the music.
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:50.100]   Yeah, but it's just--
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:51.020]   So harmony.
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:52.380]   What does this mean for Apple TV?
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.300]   I guess it's kind of similar to the iPhone and--
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.460]   --have to do it.
[01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:59.380]   Well, just that people who want a cleaner, more secure system
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:01.420]   will still buy Apple TVs.
[01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:05.020]   But if people who want more open system and can do more stuff,
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.460]   they'll get an Android stick.
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:06.980]   I think so.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:07.940]   To plug in their TV.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:09.980]   Does it mean smart TVs are silly?
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:10.540]   Because--
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:12.340]   Oh, heck no.
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:14.500]   Samsung this year is doing so much cool stuff with their
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.460]   smart TV that people probably aren't even using.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:16.700]   They have a--
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:17.460]   You know what, though, Robert?
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:19.780]   I hate it when my TV says, would you like to log into
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:20.580]   Facebook now?
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:21.100]   That's annoying.
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.380]   I don't do it to that myself.
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:22.900]   It does.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:23.180]   It's annoying.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:23.540]   And I'll be--
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:24.220]   I'm trying to watch a show.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.340]   And it says, you're not logged into Facebook.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:26.820]   I'd--
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:29.180]   I would shoot the thing at the spot.
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:30.660]   I turned most of that stuff off.
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:33.740]   And I'd say that most of the apps I see from the independent
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.980]   offerings from the manufacturers are kind of weak.
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:39.340]   Why they aren't simply offering the Android marketplace
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.340]   right now.
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.180]   It's kind of beyond me.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.860]   And that, I think, is really what Apple is looking at.
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:45.540]   And, well, they should be, at least.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:48.660]   And having their own TV that can just simply take that
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:51.060]   experience and link it from your mobile devices to the
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.540]   bigger screen.
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:53.020]   I do--
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.420]   I hope they make a projector.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:55.500]   I do like this one.
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.660]   I bet you it'll be well calibrated and a really good
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.580]   quality display, too.
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:00.580]   But it will be a premium product.
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:02.580]   I do like this one.
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:03.580]   Of course.
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:04.660]   I do like this one, though, from Holman Jenkins' column in
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:07.100]   which he said, Apple used to be preoccupied with making
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:08.260]   great products.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:12.940]   But increasingly lately, it's preoccupied with strategy,
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:17.740]   which he defines as zero-sum maneuvering versus hated
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:18.140]   rivals.
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:19.620]   Is that not accurate?
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.620]   I think it's an exaggeration.
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:23.180]   All right.
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:24.620]   I think you could say that any year.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.660]   And some people would not and some people would make their
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.020]   heads.
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:27.540]   OK.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:30.260]   I think it has something to do with the whole Maps fiasco.
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.260]   And everyone.
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.260]   Oh, no.
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:33.260]   Everyone jumps on it.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.260]   It's not difficult that is to do right.
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:36.700]   So there's another flaw in Java.
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:38.900]   Who's running Java?
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:40.740]   The last week there was a flaw in Java.
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:43.420]   This week there's a new one that they say could affect as
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:44.460]   many as a billion users.
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.660]   You know when you install Java?
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:47.820]   It says we're on six billion machines.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:51.860]   Well, it's on everyone from Java 5 right to today's Java.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:55.340]   There is a patch that Oracle--
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:58.940]   well, I think did Oracle push out a patch yet or not?
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:44:59.460]   I can't remember.
[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.540]   I recently did an update.
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:01.740]   And I thought it was all automatic.
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:02.900]   That was last week's flaw.
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:06.220]   There's an I-figures.
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:09.100]   For the two things I still use Java for.
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:10.620]   Well, that's, I guess, the bottom line.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:11.620]   Turn off Java unless you need it.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.460]   Actually, it's an Android, mostly a Java environment.
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:14.940]   It is.
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:17.740]   But I don't think that it means it doesn't impact that.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:21.060]   I'm still a relatively new Android user, so getting up to
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:21.660]   speed.
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:22.700]   That's what Oracle says, right?
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:25.260]   All right.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.900]   Did you see this kick to the curb kickstarters hidden
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.260]   waste heap of killed projects?
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:31.940]   Speaking of a kickstarter.
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:33.220]   Yes.
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:36.420]   I'm sure that's an interesting list.
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:39.260]   I have only received one thing from every--
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:41.620]   well, I don't know, Diaspora, I guess, launched.
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.980]   So I got a Diaspora membership.
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.460]   That was the first kickstarter thing.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.700]   The thing is I'm going to replace Facebook.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:48.060]   Now they've gone on to other things.
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:49.780]   You were huge on that.
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:51.500]   Well, I just wanted something, but it's not.
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:52.500]   I don't know.
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:54.380]   It's hopeless.
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:57.380]   And then I got the Joey Bra, which is a bra
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:59.900]   with a pouch, like a baby kangaroo.
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:01.220]   You could stick your iPhone in.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:02.780]   It's a bra.
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:04.100]   That was with a pouch?
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:05.540]   It was too small.
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:06.980]   Sorry.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.060]   But everything else I've ever bought on Kickstarter,
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.180]   I've never received anything.
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:12.580]   But now, apparently, if you go to some--
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:15.340]   for instance, this is a vented goods.
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:16.420]   Or is that what it's called?
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:18.540]   Vented goods?
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:22.060]   They were going to make vintage style leather bags.
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:26.900]   Kickstarter got a cease and desist from another company.
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:29.780]   10 hours before the project closed,
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:32.300]   and it was on its way to getting funded,
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:37.300]   it disappeared, saying this project no longer available.
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.540]   It was taken down over intellectual property dispute.
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:41.820]   Turns out this is non-unusual.
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:47.140]   Kickstarter will take DMCA requests and pull down projects.
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:51.740]   I've only gotten into a handful of Kickstarter projects.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:53.980]   And just usually products I'm interested in.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:55.860]   And please let me know if you get those sticks.
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:57.580]   I think that is a great idea.
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:58.060]   Those are coming from--
[01:46:58.060 --> 01:46:59.060]   I invested in--
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:01.060]   Yeah, and I got some--
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:01.780]   I've got this--
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.100]   Maybe I should--
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:03.780]   Never mind.
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:04.280]   Pebble.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.020]   I invested in Pebble.
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:05.980]   Oh, I love the Pebble Watch.
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:07.620]   Yeah, well, you don't even have the Pebble Watch.
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:08.620]   What do you mean you love--
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:09.220]   You love the Pebble Watch.
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:10.020]   In time for Christmas.
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.620]   You're not going to get a Pebble Watch.
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:12.620]   You're not going to get it.
[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.980]   You're the most idealistic person I've ever met.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:15.940]   Don't you see the very stick--
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:17.060]   Excuse me, then.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:17.580]   Excuse me, then.
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:20.060]   Charging stand for the iPhone that everyone bought.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.220]   Like it was one of these big guys.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:22.780]   Yeah, and then they changed the connector.
[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:24.900]   Yeah, so they took forever to manufacture.
[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:25.900]   They're still shipping them out.
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:28.060]   They still haven't even originally gotten them
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:29.820]   to all the original backers yet.
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:31.540]   And now there's new iPhones.
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:32.580]   So like this--
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:36.860]   Chasing its tail.
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:38.540]   Yeah, OK.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:40.300]   We're still talking about Apple, aren't we?
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:41.460]   I don't know why I can't stop--
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:43.460]   I should have found something else to discuss.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:45.420]   How about audible.com?
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.660]   You know audiobooks.
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:47.660]   Do you love audiobooks?
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:49.900]   I am a knight of audible.com.
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:53.300]   I have heard of this company.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.260]   They're an Amazon company.
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.620]   They're huge.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:56.100]   I don't know.
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.460]   They've got over 100,000 books.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:58.060]   That's pretty big.
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:00.220]   It's like a really great bookstore
[01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:01.380]   with some of your favorite books.
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:02.660]   But they're read by--
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:04.620]   now see, people are telling me--
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:06.700]   there's a guy out there who goes in the chat.
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:08.860]   Remember time I said I read a book on audible
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:12.060]   and says, you know, that's like fingers on a blackboard to me.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:13.180]   You don't read a book.
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:14.860]   You listen to a book.
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:16.020]   He's right.
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:16.580]   He's right.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.420]   I can't deny it.
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:19.260]   But I have been reading books on all of those.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:20.860]   No, you've been listening.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:22.860]   I'm taking up the cudgel.
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:23.360]   No.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:24.260]   I don't even know what that means.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:25.060]   Yes, I like it.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:26.220]   He's taking up the cudgel.
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:27.620]   He's going to cudgel me.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:28.980]   You're assaulting.
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.580]   I listen to books on audible, and I love them.
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:35.100]   I just ordered-- and it's my next listen--
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:39.140]   the book that's blowing the lid off of Seal Team 6.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:39.980]   No easy day.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.780]   The first-hand account of the mission that killed us.
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:43.500]   Yeah, we saw that guy.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:44.300]   What, you saw him?
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:45.620]   Well, he was on 60 Minutes.
[01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:47.020]   What'd you think?
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.300]   Eh, so there's something scamish about the whole thing.
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.140]   You don't think-- well, was he not on Seal Team 6?
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:52.860]   No, but he could have been.
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:54.760]   Apparently, you can't put it down.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:55.960]   Listen.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.560]   You want to hear it?
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.060]   Here, listen.
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:58.200]   See if you can put this down.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:58.960]   Just a little bit.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:01.480]   Just from unclassified publications and sources.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:05.120]   Nothing written here is intended to confirm or deny officially
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:08.120]   or unofficially any events described.
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:11.040]   Try and put that down.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.040]   Sounds like a dis--
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:12.840]   It sounds like a dis--
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.040]   It sounds like a terms of service.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.440]   It wasn't the best section.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.640]   Can I-- am I allowed to complain about audiobooks?
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.140]   Sure.
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:20.640]   It's all complaining.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.760]   Pro-audio book segment.
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:22.760]   Do you not like audiobooks?
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:24.080]   Well, no, it's an ad actually.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:24.080]   But did--
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.760]   I had a poor audiobook experience, which is--
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.960]   Well, you didn't go to Audible, that kind of--
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.800]   I did.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.600]   So Audible's integrated with iTunes.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.440]   Yes.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:33.520]   Sorry, an Apple device that I have right here.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:35.040]   Or you can listen to the Audible ad.
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.040]   Right, but I had downloaded it through iTunes.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:39.120]   Yes.
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:40.240]   Tina Fey's bossy pants.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.680]   Like a year ago, whatever--
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:42.720]   I never came out.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.600]   --listened to it.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.400]   You can't delete it from the phone.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:47.040]   You have to go plug your phone into your--
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.280]   That's the Audible's fault.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.840]   That's Apple's fault.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.720]   I'm just-- I thought it was an audio book's problem.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:58.120]   And now, every time my phone is plugged into an audio--
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:49:58.600]   Pausey pants.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:49:59.760]   --it doesn't know what to play.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.840]   It just starts playing into your face.
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.920]   Oh, hold on a second.
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.520]   Let me get this straight.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:08.720]   Now, when I take my phone and plug it into the computer,
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:10.960]   it shows up as a disk drive.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:13.120]   And I can take those books and just delete them.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:13.720]   That's an Android.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.320]   Now, that seems to me to be the logical way to go,
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.000]   because it has a connector.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.280]   Goes on the computer.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:20.320]   It shows the file.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:22.560]   I just say erase it, and it erases.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.280]   You're telling me that Apple doesn't do that?
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.840]   Actually, if you use the Audible app, it makes it very easy.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.800]   Well, that's what I should do.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:28.360]   I should do that.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:28.360]   You should.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.200]   And it's fantastic.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.680]   I can download even any book.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:35.000]   This is every book I've ever bought on Audible.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.480]   500 books over the last 12 years.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.600]   And any book that I don't want to listen to,
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.520]   I could just press and hold it and delete it.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:43.640]   It's as easy as pie.
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:44.800]   I actually haven't downloaded that.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.640]   But if I had downloaded it, let me pick something I've listened to.
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.080]   I just-- I am a big fan.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.880]   And the nice thing is your library is already here.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:53.400]   So every book you've ever listened to--
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.080]   It seems as if you're backed up.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:55.560]   What do you mean?
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:56.440]   Like, I have too many books?
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:57.120]   I do.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:58.920]   I love it, because I can't stop.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.920]   So here's what's on my list.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.320]   The magic of reality, the name of the wind, the end of money,
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.080]   black beauty, huckleberry, fin David Copperfield,
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:08.560]   Dracula, Ethan Frome.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.480]   I'm going to read that one of these days.
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.560]   Oh, I can't wait to read this.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:13.280]   Grand Pursuit.
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:14.520]   This is Sylvia Nasser.
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.720]   She wrote a beautiful mind.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:19.280]   Her new book is a history of economics.
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:22.440]   Yeah, I think I had riveting.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.760]   All right, Mr. Bossy Pants, listen to this.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:26.520]   Here's Tina Fey.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.600]   Every time she gets in her car, four Liz Gaines hears this.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.520]   Aasha audio presents Bossy Pants.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.240]   Bossy Pants.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:37.800]   Written and read by Tina Fey, including bonus materials.
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:39.560]   Is it giving you chills just to hear that?
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:41.520]   No, because it cuts to where you left off.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:42.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:44.640]   So you hear the same sentence over and over again.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:45.680]   Did you enjoy the book?
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:48.000]   It's a little bit chapter about her impersonating Tina Fey.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.080]   Lately, it's been cutting to that, so that's OK.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.160]   You enjoyed the book.
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:52.120]   It was good fun.
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.000]   Tina Fey reads it.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:53.240]   I know.
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:53.840]   I need to get it done.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.840]   You mean impersonating Sarah Palin?
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.160]   Yeah, sorry, sorry.
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.520]   Because impersonating Tina Fey would be actually kind of easy.
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.240]   True that.
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:03.920]   She wouldn't have to work so hard on that.
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:04.680]   It is a great book.
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:06.080]   I highly recommend it.
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.080]   And yes, you can delete it if you want.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.800]   Just use the Audible app to download it.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.600]   Oh, JK Rowling's new novel.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:13.520]   Have you made that?
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:15.800]   Somebody told me if you have photos and things
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:17.800]   on the iPhone, you can't just plug in.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:20.760]   Actually, that's really a pain, the photo stream thing.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:23.600]   I could take pictures of my butt, and then it goes everywhere.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.400]   It goes on the internet.
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:28.080]   It goes on my TV screen saver.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:29.000]   Are we still on?
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.880]   I fear that feature.
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.160]   Photo stream is dangerous.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:34.480]   How do you take pictures of your butt?
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:34.840]   You don't.
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:35.560]   I was joking.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:36.560]   I did not take pictures of your butt.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.040]   Could there be ways?
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.160]   Butt dialing, butt snapping.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.120]   The casual vacancy.
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:42.280]   I haven't read this.
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:45.000]   You know anything about JK Rowling's first book for grownups?
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000]   Have you heard about anything about it?
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.080]   Yeah, she's talking about it.
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:49.960]   You're wired into the publishing circles.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:52.000]   She's got money.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.800]   Part 1.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.600]   Part 1.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.880]   6, 11.
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.760]   A casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.760]   A when a local counselor fails to make his--
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:05.200]   I always get the books read by Britishers.
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:06.160]   I think that's better.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:08.600]   I think they read so beautifully.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:11.200]   They have such lovely polished posh accents.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.680]   How come you don't--
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:13.240]   I should.
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.240]   I'd like to.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.640]   I would read it just like that.
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:20.920]   That's why perhaps they have not invited me.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:23.200]   They don't think that's a good idea.
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.040]   Your accent keeps slipping, they say.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:25.840]   Could you do Russian?
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.680]   Could you read Russian?
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:27.480]   No, I could read it.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:30.120]   Oh, I hate somebody in the chat room.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:31.840]   No, I was on the Twitter.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:34.680]   Said, I am Slavic and I am offended by--
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:37.560]   No, he didn't even say I am of Slavic descent.
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:40.120]   And I am offended by your Russian accent.
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:41.240]   Because he hates the Russians.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.880]   Of course, most of the Slavs do.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:43.440]   Slavs hate the Russians.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:44.920]   They hate the Russians.
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.160]   I have people-- you watch.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:48.160]   There are people in the chat room who will now never
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:50.000]   listen again.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.160]   Because I have done the Russian accent.
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.040]   Anyway, I don't know how I got on this.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.720]   Audible.com.
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:56.280]   Here's the deal.
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.760]   Actually, you get two books free, bossy pants.
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:03.440]   You could get that book on the No Easy Day, the firsthand
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.080]   account of the killing of Osama.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:08.120]   You could get J.K. Rowling's first novel for adults.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:10.960]   They have a Terry Pratchett novel.
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:13.440]   Dodger, his latest.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:14.600]   I love Terry Pratchett.
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:16.920]   He's still writing.
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:19.680]   It's kind of about the artful Dodger, but not really.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:21.920]   He's a street urchin.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.160]   Here's the deal.
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:26.000]   Audible.com/twit2 will give you two books.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.320]   You're going to sign up for the platinum account.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.320]   That's two books a month.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.440]   But the first month's free.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:31.680]   Your first two books are free.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:32.680]   You can cancel any time.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.440]   Books are yours to keep forever.
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.520]   You could try the Audible app.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:38.680]   It's free Android, iPhone, and Windows phone.
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:40.320]   Really, sweet app.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.440]   Please give it a try today.
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:44.160]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:46.480]   And don't worry, it will not start up in your car
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:48.320]   whenever you get in.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.080]   I'm going to show her how to delete it.
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:52.800]   Or you know what you just do?
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:56.520]   It's funny because you never play anything else in your iTunes.
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:58.080]   Like, why does it always go back to that?
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.080]   Just play a song, and then it'll always play that song.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.120]   No, I don't know why I always go back to that.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.760]   It always goes back to that.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:04.720]   How do you get an Android phone if I were you?
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.160]   All right, I have an Android phone.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:07.320]   Go back to it.
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:07.960]   But I plugged it.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:08.600]   Yeah, all right.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:09.600]   I'll plug in my Android phone.
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:12.760]   There's no problems like that.
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:15.760]   I'm not going to get started.
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:18.200]   Verizon's paying Tivo a quarter of a billion dollars
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.160]   on patent litigation.
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:20.920]   Tivo has found its new business model.
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.480]   Yeah, I know.
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:22.960]   So the hell I have everybody.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.000]   Well, I think they've got a good business model with that.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.120]   They did invent the whole idea.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.280]   It's great.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:28.800]   Verizon--
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.400]   Some replay TV was in the mix.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.400]   Whatever happened to them, how come they're not selling people?
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:32.880]   They're selling people.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.240]   No, no, they sued some people too.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.040]   OK.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:38.240]   But then the problem was that motion picture industry sued them.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.000]   And they had better lawyers or something.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.640]   Tivo got a half billion from Dish.
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:44.680]   Wow.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:48.720]   Yeah, $215 million from AT&T.
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:49.720]   And now another--
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:50.320]   Inverse?
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.880]   And now another $250 million.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.720]   That's almost a billion dollars from Verizon.
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:56.920]   I've always liked the Dish gun thing better
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.440]   than the other stuff, personally.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.760]   So I think they can probably afford it.
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:01.280]   They are suing Cisco.
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:03.560]   I want to get a hopper, the hopper.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:04.840]   I was surprised.
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:07.000]   I'm driving through LA.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.520]   Entertainment capital of the world.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.360]   And there's a big billboard that says, don't listen to ads,
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:15.040]   Dish Hopper.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.200]   It's like throwing it in the face of the--
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:18.240]   Don't do it in LA.
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:19.840]   Do it in Des Moines.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.560]   Throw it in the face.
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:23.120]   Of course, they're asking for trouble.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:24.240]   They're asking for trouble.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:27.000]   Don't buy a big billboard that says you don't have to watch
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:27.840]   commercials anymore.
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:29.160]   Ads, ever.
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:30.320]   That's just crazy.
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.320]   It's great.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:34.960]   It's a great product.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:37.000]   Well, yeah, but it's not going to be around much longer.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.720]   They're being sued by everybody.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:39.640]   Like Napster.
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.240]   Yeah, like Napster.
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:43.320]   Streams of water once flowed on Mars.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:44.240]   Oh, I better not say that.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:46.240]   We've been doing two hours of shows.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.480]   Everybody's got to get up.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.040]   Awesome.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:50.160]   We've been drinking beer.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.080]   Isn't that cool?
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:51.840]   It is.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.960]   I think it's bull crap.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:55.960]   OK.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:57.120]   No, it's not.
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.240]   Curiosity is on Mars.
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:03.640]   They lowered it via strings from a platform like a freaking
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:05.080]   puppet.
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:07.920]   Yeah, the thing is moved like all of five feet so far.
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.640]   But they found it.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.080]   I think it's going to half a mile.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.320]   It's moving around.
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:11.960]   It's chucking.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.800]   Look what it found.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:15.000]   It found rivulets.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.280]   It found evidence.
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:18.120]   It looks like cracking to me.
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.640]   You're just not a geologist.
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:21.720]   It says, if you were a geologist, John,
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:23.120]   you would look at that and you say, hey,
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:24.160]   that's proof positive.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:27.520]   Water once ran across the surface of Mars.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:29.200]   Those are river rocks, dude.
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:34.200]   Apparently, the evidence was so obvious that the meeting
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.040]   that they did online, the livestream event that they held,
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.520]   it was like one of the reporters just started railing on.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:41.560]   It's like, this is stuff that a second year geologist in college
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:42.560]   would have been able to recognize.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:43.920]   Why didn't you guys just jump up and down
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.680]   and tell us the center?
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:46.520]   It's like, apparently, they wanted to be really, really
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:48.800]   certain and actually get a close up shot of that.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:49.560]   The mainstream.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:50.880]   So when did they first realize it?
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:53.320]   Well, the funny thing is pick that landing spot.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:54.840]   And because of the way the water looks like it's
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.440]   flowing out of the mountain and everything.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:57.600]   For that reason.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.000]   Yeah, the funny thing is they had the press conference--
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.520]   What was liquid CO2?
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.560]   Wouldn't it have the same effect?
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.720]   No, there's no such thing as liquid CO2.
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:07.560]   What are you crazy?
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.040]   How cold do you think it is?
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:11.240]   There could be liquid nitrogen.
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:12.760]   It's not the earliest liquid nitrogen.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:14.280]   There is 400 degrees.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:16.400]   What about ether?
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.240]   It's alcohol.
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:19.080]   So we've got the moon with water.
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.960]   Europa is covered in ice.
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.760]   Don't you love it, though?
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:22.920]   They have the flowing rivers.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.640]   They had the press conference on Thursday,
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.200]   but Curiosity tweeted the day before,
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.120]   I found evidence of an ancient stream bed on Mars.
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.800]   So it was on the Twitter that you found out about that.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:33.560]   That's awesome.
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:34.160]   I heard--
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:34.720]   I heard--
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:34.720]   I heard--
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:37.560]   You know, when I was in Tellurite some years ago,
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.920]   there was one of the NASA scientists.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:41.280]   This was like five or 10 years ago.
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.840]   They said they've always known there's water there.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.760]   Oh.
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:47.640]   Well, why didn't they tell anybody?
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:49.760]   No, I think they did, but nobody paid attention.
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:51.600]   Do they have the rip unit?
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:55.960]   So they had to send a car-sized lab--
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:59:12.160]   nuclear-powered super-
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:14.160]   I definitely do when I was stoked when I got the push notification
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:15.440]   that they followed me back.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:16.440]   They followed you back.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.960]   Sarcastic Rover follows me.
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.640]   They have some good taste.
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:23.320]   So no, I do follow a number of strange accounts on Twitter,
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.240]   but I-- oh, man, don't mistype Twitter.
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.080]   Congratulations.
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:27.280]   You've missed a lot.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:28.560]   Don't mistype Twitter.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:31.720]   What did you-- oh, you typed-- you got the ad.
[01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:33.160]   Where's your Alt-F4 now?
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:34.720]   Oh, I hate that.
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.840]   I am today's 100,000th visiter.
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:37.720]   It's unbelievable.
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.520]   On a coincidence.
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:39.680]   Sarcastic Rover.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:45.040]   Mars Rax-- Mars Rax are volcanic, by which I mean.
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:49.400]   They're made bovikanos, but also they have a super short
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:50.600]   temper, maybe if I read that one.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:51.360]   Maybe try another one.
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:52.400]   Funny.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:56.000]   Super stoked that NASA has me rubbing up on every rock
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.240]   within every easy reach.
[01:59:58.240 --> 01:59:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:00.960]   Robot humor, I think.
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:04.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:08.160]   I still prefer the Goldman Sachs elevator to Twitter feed.
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:09.360]   That's a very good one.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:09.760]   That's got to be--
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:12.520]   That's a classic.
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.200]   Urban Outfitters--
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:13.720]   You're just a good one.
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:16.320]   Sarcastic Rover says, just realize the--
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.960]   I found a river on Mars stuff is probably
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:20.440]   the hard point of my life.
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:22.840]   So next 30 years should be super fun.
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:23.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:26.680]   It's like winning the Little League World Series.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:28.960]   What do you do for an encore?
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:34.520]   So GoDaddy is going to patent announcing a domain name
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:36.360]   registration on a social website.
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:38.200]   Man, how is that patentable?
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.120]   I just read an article that said, we should get rid of all
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.440]   patents, not just software patents.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.400]   Oh, yeah, no.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:43.720]   Most people agree with that.
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:44.280]   Really?
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:45.120]   Yeah.
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:46.880]   It's not a radical view.
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:48.960]   Wasn't the idea that the patent--
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:51.000]   Was to protect a small guy, too.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.160]   It doesn't protect the small guy.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:53.680]   It doesn't protect anybody.
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:55.000]   It's just a cost.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.200]   It used to beat the small guy into submission.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:59.800]   It was a prudent innovation.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:01.680]   We have cooler stuff without them.
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:05.640]   This article-- I see it seemed controversial to me.
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:08.160]   Jordan Weisman writing in the Atlantic,
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:12.320]   the case for abolishing all patents.
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:14.680]   He actually quotes a working paper
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:18.920]   from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.320]   by two professors at Washington University of St. Louis
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:24.360]   who argue that any patent system, no matter how well
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:28.280]   conceived, is bound to devolve into the kind of quagmire
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.360]   we're dealing with today.
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:30.520]   So it's not software patents.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:32.920]   It's just patents.
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:38.280]   Somebody patented a time machine.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.520]   And it went through.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.840]   They got the patent.
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:43.480]   Well, they-- yeah, because they went in advance.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:45.160]   And then they went back in time.
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:47.280]   And then they jiggled with the numbers.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.680]   And then they returned to their own home time.
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:50.520]   And that was easy to do.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:52.240]   You're saying it's working.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:53.600]   Did you see Looper's yet?
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.320]   I heard it's awesome.
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:55.360]   It's a great movie.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.160]   I did not expect anything with Bruce Willis.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:58.640]   I thought--
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:01:59.840]   Did you say 12 monkeys?
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:00.640]   He's done a lot of good films.
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:01.000]   It's good.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:01.800]   No, Bruce is great.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:02.840]   In fact, there's a die-arm moment.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:03.340]   It's a hawk.
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:04.960]   Where he shoots all the back guys.
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:05.440]   That's a hawk.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:05.960]   Hudson Hawk.
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:09.000]   That's as long as Disney story be.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000]   I did like Looper's.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.400]   I thought it was surprisingly good.
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:16.000]   So what do you think of the TV show Revolution?
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:16.880]   You know, I didn't see it.
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:17.480]   Have you seen it?
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:18.720]   It's terrible.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:20.520]   It's too bad, because it's great concept.
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:22.560]   It's stolen from--
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:23.560]   Another show.
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:25.240]   Metaphilter went on a--
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:27.160]   They show the thing that was posted on the internet.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:29.000]   You can see the other show, the original pilot
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.080]   for some other guys.
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:31.440]   The whole idea was stolen.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:31.960]   Well, that's--
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.200]   But the story still be a good show.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.440]   No, no, it sucks.
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:35.200]   I love the idea.
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:37.240]   The physics are so bad that it's like it makes you--
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:40.800]   Is that the one where the power went out,
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:43.160]   and then it's like 20 years later, and Brigley Fierd's
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:44.000]   overgrown?
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:44.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.080]   OK.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.600]   I like that show.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:49.400]   I like the idea.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.360]   The good show is Grimm.
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:52.040]   That's-- yeah.
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:53.040]   I've heard none of these shows.
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:53.240]   Yeah?
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:54.200]   You like that show?
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:54.400]   All right.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:54.960]   I don't watch the--
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:55.480]   Grimm.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:55.840]   Grimm.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.000]   One M or two.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.160]   Two M. Two.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:58.520]   OK.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:02:59.480]   Because he is a Grimm.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:01.000]   But that's interesting, because there is such a thing
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.800]   as a Grimm, not Grimm's fairy tales,
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.120]   but it is Grimm's fairy tales, but he's a Grimm.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.600]   Kind of something like that.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:07.440]   I have never watched it.
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:07.880]   You should.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:08.720]   It's very entertaining.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:09.720]   All right.
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:11.920]   I think we've really degenerated to the right probably.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:12.480]   I think so, too.
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:13.600]   That's what I'm trying to point out here.
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:16.160]   She's about trying to show off right now.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:18.120]   Have you ever seen Vegas, Dantana?
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:18.720]   Great show.
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:19.440]   You see the new one?
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.160]   The new Vegas?
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:21.040]   No.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:21.720]   It's terrible.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:23.800]   Isn't the one with the dude parked his car in his living room?
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:26.640]   Where do you find time to watch so much TV, John?
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:29.760]   You got classical music in the front, TV in the back?
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:30.440]   A VHS, that's right for someone.
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:31.000]   I have--
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.800]   We are the no agenda show, which I'm a part of.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:34.520]   Yes, I've heard that.
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:36.240]   We have to get a lot of clips.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.040]   We have to keep up with the public interest, and we saw--
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:41.280]   If I'm a knight constantly looking for stuff--
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.240]   Do I have to watch TV?
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:43.640]   No.
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:44.120]   OK.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.160]   We watch so you don't have to.
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.080]   That's perfect.
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:47.800]   There you go.
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:48.240]   It's time to--
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:49.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, you know it's
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.240]   going to be a very big week when Tom Merritt actually comes in
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:54.480]   on his day off to let us know--
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:55.120]   Is he here?
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:55.560]   Yeah.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:56.920]   What's ahead on the week ahead?
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:57.680]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:58.680]   Here's a look at some of the stories.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:01.480]   We'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:04.720]   today, Sunday, today, September 30th Oracle World
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:05.200]   kicks off--
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:05.720]   Oracle World World.
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:08.680]   --the one that runs through October 4th.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:12.560]   Apple is closing ping, and iCloud storage gets downgraded
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.440]   today for former mobile me subscribers.
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.040]   Now looking ahead, Monday, October 1st.
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.520]   Demo kicks off, runs through October 3rd.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:20.440]   The O'Reilly Strata Conference-- that's
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:22.920]   a big data conference-- happens in London.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:24.840]   4chan turns 9.
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:25.840]   Oh.
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:27.160]   9th birthday 4chan.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:29.680]   And remember, no, P-N-O-L?
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:31.040]   No, nobody remembers it.
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:33.520]   Well, it shuts down on October 1st, so don't worry about it.
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:34.680]   Tuesday, October 2nd.
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:37.200]   The Nexus 7 goes on sale in Japan.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.640]   Wednesday, October 3rd, Meg Whitman makes her pitch
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:42.600]   at the HP Securities Analyst Meeting and PlayStation
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:44.320]   mobile titles go on sale.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.560]   Thursday, October 4th in Japan, the Black PS3 Slim system
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.960]   goes on sale.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.760]   And that is a look at some of the stories
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:53.400]   we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead.
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:54.120]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:55.760]   Consoles are dead, right?
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:56.760]   Ah.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:57.680]   They're gaming consoles?
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:58.520]   They're gone.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.160]   Xbox, click.
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:00.600]   I mean, I'll always love PC gaming,
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:01.960]   but there's something to be said about it.
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:03.920]   Just a simple, closed platform.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:04.480]   Really?
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:05.160]   These are views.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:07.000]   They've just not been a keep up.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.480]   I don't like the whole online community thing of getting
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:11.200]   harassed by--
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:11.680]   Two bags, 11-year-olds.
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:13.600]   Like 12-year-olds, I hate it.
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:14.640]   I hate bag you.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.280]   Do you even know what that means, sir?
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:19.320]   Although I have learned that I can handle this about anything--
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:21.800]   any profanity directed in my direction pretty well.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:22.400]   Yeah, you do.
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:22.840]   It is.
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:24.160]   You do sticks and stones.
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:24.680]   Exactly.
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:27.200]   Maybe that's what I should do to gird my loins for Twitter.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:27.640]   Girder.
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.600]   I should go online and play some call to me.
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:31.720]   You said this phrase before.
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:32.400]   Gird my loins.
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:33.240]   You don't even know what it means.
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:33.840]   Sure, I do.
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:34.360]   I'm afraid.
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:37.480]   I'm going to wrap them in special secret underwear
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.680]   so that I don't get hurt in my loins.
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:41.320]   It's magical.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:42.160]   That's what it means.
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.120]   I don't know what it means.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:45.160]   You gird your loins before you head into battle.
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:45.920]   Thinking of gilding.
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:46.480]   No, OK.
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:47.520]   It's not gild your loins.
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:48.280]   That's a different--
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:48.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:50.240]   Gild your loins.
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:51.240]   Gild your loins.
[02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:52.760]   This is guys coming with the gold loins.
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:54.280]   I'm not gild your loins anymore.
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.160]   I don't care.
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:06:00.680]   OK, I guess that's about it.
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.280]   You know, the "Pursons of Interest" TV
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:03.160]   shows back on the--
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:04.080]   I hear you like that show.
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.720]   It's dynamite.
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:07.480]   Apparently, a lot of technology in there
[02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:10.800]   would kind of make you paranoid about things like smartphones.
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:11.640]   Yes, it would.
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:12.640]   Yeah, I would say that.
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.040]   Because they use that technology.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.280]   But it's a TV show.
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:16.200]   They're making it up.
[02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:17.720]   OK.
[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:18.400]   You think it's real?
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:19.280]   That's a documentary.
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:20.080]   It's not a documentary.
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.200]   Yeah.
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.360]   It's on PBS.
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:23.760]   I was just at Universal Studios.
[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:26.120]   I know they make this stuff up.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.480]   They make it all up.
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:28.000]   It's all up.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000]   Fantasy.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:30.120]   Fantasy.
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:30.960]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:34.600]   John C. Devorak is at channeldevorak.com.
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:36.960]   He is also the host of The No Agenda Show, which
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:40.360]   is now on Thursdays and Sundays on a regular basis.
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:43.160]   I will soon be a knight, which will give me
[02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:47.960]   special privileges and a signet ring in my own ceiling wax.
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:50.240]   Does each knight get a unique ceiling wing?
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:50.880]   Wing?
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:51.880]   Wing?
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:54.480]   The wing of wax.
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:56.160]   A wing?
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:56.760]   Yes.
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:00.200]   Do I get my own ceiling wing and ceiling wax?
[02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:01.800]   It looks like--
[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:02.720]   Why do-- no.
[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:03.600]   The rest of them.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:04.320]   Oh, wait.
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.080]   So they're all the same?
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:08.160]   Well, you get a little certificate that's got your name
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:08.400]   on it.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:09.240]   That's different.
[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:10.760]   Oh.
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:12.360]   OK.
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.120]   Thank you for being here, Mr. Devorak.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:15.120]   It's always a pleasure.
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:17.840]   Enjoy your bottle of extra virgin olive oil.
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:19.320]   I've heard there's a scandal, by the way,
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.480]   that you cannot trust extra virgin olive oil.
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:23.120]   Much of it is canola oil.
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:23.620]   No.
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:25.720]   No, that's probably not true, generally speaking,
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:26.960]   if you get from a good source.
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:27.000]   Yes.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.800]   But you should note that a lot of Italian olive oil--
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:30.320]   Yes.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:31.480]   --is actually not Italian.
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:34.280]   It just says-- unless it says product of Italy,
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:36.120]   it usually says packed in Italy.
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:37.560]   And if you look around on the label,
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:40.080]   that means it's actually coming from Turkey or Spain.
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:40.680]   That's fine.
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:44.280]   As long as there was an olive involved, I'm OK.
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:46.760]   I think there's a whole olive oil expose a book.
[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:47.760]   I think so.
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:48.200]   I have some.
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:48.840]   I think so.
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:50.680]   I think a lot of the olive oil that we're buying
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:54.200]   is not regulated by the olive oil officials.
[02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:55.200]   In the US, it might be.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.400]   But you know, it's a tragedy.
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:58.000]   It's called extra virginity.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:58.500]   See?
[02:07:58.500 --> 02:07:59.320]   That was OK.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:00.880]   Well, people should look into this.
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:03.080]   It's on cable TV, so you know it's true.
[02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:05.000]   The brazen fraud in the olive oil industry.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:05.760]   It is Sally.
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:06.640]   Raisin.
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:07.120]   Raisin.
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:07.480]   See?
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.960]   She's a reporter.
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.520]   That's an actual reporter.
[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:11.920]   I'm just reading off the internet.
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:14.920]   Well, it isn't that what most reporters do nowadays.
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:15.920]   That's all it takes.
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:15.920]   I know.
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:16.920]   I know.
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:18.600]   I miss.
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:21.080]   Robert Herron is the man.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:22.160]   I'll tell you.
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:24.720]   You see him on, of course, many shows on revision three
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.080]   still from time to time on "Texilla."
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:29.120]   But also, you can go to heronfidelity.com.
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:29.620]   Yes.
[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:30.320]   Thank you very much.
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:31.320]   And hire him.
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:31.840]   Yeah.
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:33.920]   Calibrate your TV or whatever.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:35.200]   Do you-- you calibrate?
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:35.720]   I do.
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:36.800]   All over the Bay Area.
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:37.800]   Oh, that's set up.
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:38.320]   Help people.
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.320]   Wouldn't you like this guy to come to your house and say,
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:41.120]   it's not right.
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:42.720]   It's-- it can get expensive.
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:43.220]   It's--
[02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:44.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:46.720]   You say that when you come in?
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:47.720]   It's going to be very expensive.
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:48.720]   It's not good.
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:49.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.720]   That's what must replace everything.
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:51.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:53.220]   You really need more secret.
[02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:55.120]   This is not a good ad for Herronfidelity.
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:56.320]   You need four subwoers.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:58.120]   If you can afford him, he's the best.
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:59.120]   Four subwoers.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:00.120]   Four is an optimal.
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:00.620]   Four.
[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:01.120]   One on each wall.
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:01.620]   Not one?
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:02.820]   No, centered on each wall.
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:03.820]   But they're not directional.
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:04.820]   Does it slow?
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:04.820]   No.
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:05.820]   You put them in the knolls, though.
[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:07.320]   And it helps cancel out the knolls in the room.
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.620]   And it's-- it's magical.
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:09.620]   I'm telling you.
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:10.620]   Four, so I need three more.
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:11.620]   John's rolling with two.
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:12.620]   And that's a good start.
[02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:13.620]   But there are certain ways.
[02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:14.120]   But four.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:18.220]   And if you really got the box, you just stack four stacks of four.
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:20.920]   So then it really starts--
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:22.820]   This is going to get expensive, isn't it?
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:23.820]   Jeez.
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:24.320]   It sounds so good.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.020]   Not to mention the power consumption.
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:26.820]   Hey, that's--
[02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:27.820]   Yeah, they can be passive.
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:28.820]   Sharp solar products.
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:29.820]   You passive.
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:30.820]   Sun's napsolar.
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:31.820]   Get your stuff rolling.
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:32.820]   Highest efficiency.
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:35.820]   Heronfidelity.com to find out more.
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:37.320]   And of course, the great Liz Gaines.
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:38.820]   It's great to have you from All Things D.
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:39.820]   Like Forgotten Tea.
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:41.820]   Can I pimp one of my things?
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:42.820]   Please.
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:43.820]   I would love you to.
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:44.820]   We've been pimping everybody else.
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:45.820]   I know, right?
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:46.820]   I don't give out rings.
[02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:49.320]   But All Things D's having a conference that I'm in charge of.
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:50.320]   It's called Dive Into Mobile.
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:51.320]   It's in October.
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:52.320]   It's in New York.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:53.320]   That's awesome.
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:54.320]   It's very expensive.
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:55.320]   But--
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.320]   But you'll give us a discount.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.320]   Hey, who is all these?
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:58.320]   Hey.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:09:59.320]   It's okay.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:00.320]   It's totally here.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:01.320]   It's the cheapest thing here.
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.320]   And we-- you're going to get some really awesome stuff in the Schwag bag.
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.320]   Like--
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.320]   The All Things D conferences are fantastic.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:09.320]   Is Dive Into Mobile new or is this--
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:11.320]   This is the second Dive Into Mobile.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:12.320]   But it's the first that I am--
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:13.320]   Did you get to dive in?
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:14.320]   Did you get to dive in?
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.320]   And soon.
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:16.320]   It's soon.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:17.320]   It's in a month.
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.320]   Where's it going to be?
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:19.320]   New York City.
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:22.320]   So Walter Cara will be there but also Ina Freed.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.320]   Ina Freed.
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:24.320]   Ina, I always say Ina.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:25.320]   Ina Wrong.
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.320]   Yeah, Ina and I are putting it together.
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.320]   We have Andy Rubin is coming.
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:31.320]   Ina Lop is coming.
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:33.320]   Fabrizio Bloisi.
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:36.320]   Yeah, that's the biggest mobile company in South America.
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:37.320]   In America.
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:39.320]   Steven Eilop, that'll be interesting.
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:41.320]   Wow, this sounds good.
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:42.320]   So find out more.
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.320]   Dive Into Mobile, Global Edition.
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.320]   New York City, October 29th and 30th at the Museum of Jewish Heritage
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:51.320]   and the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park.
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:53.320]   Do you know what's in the Schwag bag?
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:54.320]   Yeah, there's going to be--
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:58.320]   Well, there's going to be a lot of good stuff but one thing that I recently heard about
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:04.320]   that's pretty super awesome is a device by one of the speakers we just mentioned.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:05.320]   It makes really cool devices.
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:06.320]   I know what it is.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.320]   You have phone.
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:09.320]   Windows Phone.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:13.320]   It's either that or an Italian phone.
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:18.320]   Would you ask the CEO of WhatsApp who's going to be, I see on your stage, Janine?
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:19.320]   Yeah, I'm going to be interviewing.
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:21.320]   That's a security issue of WhatsApp.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:22.320]   Yeah, for sure.
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:25.320]   Because there have been security experts who say, you know, this stuff is not encrypted
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:26.320]   in the least.
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:27.320]   You could see everything.
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:29.320]   Yeah, and I mean, their whole shtick is security, right?
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:31.320]   Because it's a social network where you don't even have an account.
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:32.320]   I love WhatsApp.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:33.320]   I love WhatsApp.
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:34.320]   Yeah, so I definitely want to ask about that.
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:36.320]   I use it like crazy and I would like to know about that.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:38.320]   It's not the end of the world, it's just chatting.
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:42.320]   No, but I think they actually think that they're doing a service for the world because, you know,
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.320]   activists will be able to use WhatsApp instead of Facebook.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.320]   Yeah, don't.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:48.320]   If you're an activist, my advice to you, don't.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:50.320]   I'll see what you have to say.
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:51.320]   Yeah, not as much.
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:53.320]   No, there should be some really cool speakers.
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:55.320]   Like, Jan has never really spoken after.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:57.320]   No, I think they'll be great.
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:02.320]   And Xiaomi, which is this Chinese smartphone maker that is making like a top-of-the-line
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:06.320]   Android smartphone and selling it for 300 bucks unlocked over the Internet.
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:07.320]   Wow.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:08.320]   And they're just blowing up.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:09.320]   Wow.
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.320]   Ben Lindelby there from Xiaomi.
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:12.320]   That's cool.
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:13.320]   You can have any coverage online, I'm sure.
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:14.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:15.320]   Sweet.
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:19.320]   Do you, you see, yeah, I like that because you don't stream them live, but you can always
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:20.320]   watch them like after the fact.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:22.320]   Some of it will be streamed, but not every session.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:23.320]   Fantastic.
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.320]   The field trip just loaded itself on the made little phone.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:27.320]   Yeah, isn't that cool?
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:31.320]   You just sent it from the web and it just comes and arrives and it's happy to see you.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:32.320]   So there you go, Liz Gaines.
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:33.320]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:34.320]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:38.320]   We do Twitch at 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:43.320]   That's 2,000 UTC until the time zone change, you know, the daylight savings time ends at
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:44.320]   twit.tv.
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:48.320]   If you can't watch live, and we love it if you watch live because it really, we get,
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.320]   it's great feedback from the chatroom and it's always fun to have you here.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:54.960]   But if you can't watch live, we do invite you to download an on-demand version, audio
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:01.680]   and video available at twit.tv shortly after the show concludes, which should happen in
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:02.680]   the next hour or so.
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:04.600]   The show concludes.
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:06.480]   And then we'll do the video.
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:07.480]   Great to have you all.
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:08.480]   Thanks for being here.
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:09.480]   We'll see you next time.
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:10.480]   Another tweet.
