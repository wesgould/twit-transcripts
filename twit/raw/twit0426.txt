[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.560]   It's the show where we take the tech news of the week,
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.160]   push it together in high pressures
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.800]   until there's a big bang explosion and boom,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.840]   we've got a golden iPhone.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.080]   I'm Father Robert Ballis here, the digital Jesuit,
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.240]   in for Leo LaPorte, who's on his way back
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.480]   for my well-deserved vacation.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.120]   But I didn't come alone, my big bang panel starts with
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.680]   Mr. Patrick Norton next to me in studio,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.360]   Patrick, the star of Techzilla.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   And this week in computer hardware here
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.120]   on the TWIT TV network, Patrick,
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.040]   thank you for making that drive all the way up here.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.880]   - My pleasure.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.760]   - What are you working on recently?
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640]   I saw you pulling up and it looked like
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.280]   you were moving someone's sofa.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.400]   - That's actually a small sofa for the reading area,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.280]   for the library, for my son's school,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.360]   and my wife is building.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.960]   - So, sort of dad stuff.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.800]   - Dad stuff.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.640]   - You are such a dad.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.480]   - I am a dad.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.760]   - You know who else is a dad?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.400]   Mr. Brian Brushwood, the man, the myth, the legend,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.520]   the scam mister who eats fire.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.040]   - And try to keep all of this a secret from you.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.160]   You're just outing me.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.040]   Now people know I had sex once.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.080]   - Maybe three times.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.800]   - Now that, well, yes, well, we have it on tape.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.480]   No, but seriously, what we do have is you
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.800]   in some sort of hotel room.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.960]   Tell us where are you right now?
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.560]   - I am down in Los Angeles.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.240]   I actually just did a three day,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.720]   I was asked to give two lectures
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.120]   and perform a live stage show at this intensive
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.760]   from that's hosted by Neil Strauss,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.880]   the guy who wrote the game,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.760]   the New York Times Best Selling book
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.920]   about the pickup artist community.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.760]   He's got this whole thing on life hacking
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.680]   that he was doing that I got to talk about.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.280]   As a matter of fact, today,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.880]   I just got to learn a brand new way to escape from zip ties
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.480]   or from duct tape that I had never seen before.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.280]   It was really awesome.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.720]   - Any knowledge that you could pass on
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.800]   to the studio audience, which may at one point
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.920]   or another be tied in zip ties?
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.640]   - I totally will on an upcoming episode of Scam School.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.480]   Watch this.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.320]   (laughing)
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.760]   - You got it, these, there's a professional gentleman,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.000]   there's a professional.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.400]   You know who else is joining us,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.720]   another consummate professional
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.880]   and a good friend of the show,
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.480]   Mr. Patrick Bezia.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.720]   Patrick, thank you for coming in.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.320]   What time is it over there?
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.880]   - It is 17 minutes past midnight.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.440]   So it's past my bedtime by about two hours, you know?
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.400]   I tried to-- - So we should be ending right
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   about the time that you should be waking up.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.880]   - Exactly, that's what I usually aim for
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.040]   when I come onto it.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.160]   And it's always an immense pleasure, so it works out.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.640]   - Well, there we go, that's your panel, the dais cast.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.200]   Let's get right into it.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.440]   We've got, I think we can all agree,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.160]   the biggest story of the past week
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.080]   was the busting of Silk Road.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.520]   Now this was a website in sort of the dark
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.880]   and at the gray CD area of the internet
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.080]   that you could only access through the Tor network.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.440]   For those who don't know what the Tor network is,
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.040]   think of it as, well, an onion, that's what Tor is,
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.880]   the onion router, that allows you to grain anonymity
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.320]   because as your packets pass from one router to the next,
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.080]   they only know the next router that they're going to.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.560]   It's a nice way to sort of guarantee
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.000]   that someone can't track back your actual IP address.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.840]   Well, we covered a little bit about the Tor network
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.080]   not too long ago and how it had been compromised
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.080]   by the federal government, so I guess it was only
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.720]   a matter of time before they busted the biggest website
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.360]   in this darknet and that was the Silk Road.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.160]   Now Silk Road, for those who, again, maybe haven't been
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.840]   jumping around on the Tor network,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.960]   was sort of a clearing house for things illegal
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.000]   on the internet.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.800]   You could buy narcotics, you could buy card swipes,
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.000]   you could pretty much sell and trade anything
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.640]   using Bitcoin.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.040]   Patrick, I'd like to point out that my co-host
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.440]   on Twi, Texas, and the Asian, Robert Heron, bought Twinkies
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.360]   using Bitcoins on the Silk Road.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.040]   Right, so it doesn't all have to be illegal.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.000]   In fact, I will also admit, I've dabbled a little bit
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.960]   in the Tor, a little bit in the Silk Road,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.360]   just to see what you could have sent to your house.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.480]   Patrick or Schwood, have either of you ever played
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   with Silk Road at all?
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.440]   - Good cool, I thought you were gonna say Bitcoin,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.880]   but then you go straight to Silk Road,
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.200]   the answer is hell's no.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.600]   (laughing)
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.720]   But I'm fascinated, I'm fascinated by,
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.760]   like Silk Road sort of rose to prominence
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.160]   by having a best practices for anonymity
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.520]   to protect everyone.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.320]   And in many ways, the shutting,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.600]   and of course, there's horrific stuff on Silk Road.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.680]   You know, everything from, you know,
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.520]   if you could buy pornography, you could contract killings,
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.320]   you could have drugs, people were selling fraudulent,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.720]   IDs that they would ship over.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.840]   Nobody's defending what was sold on Silk Road.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.280]   But I wonder if one of the things that's happening
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.400]   is there's a lot of talk about how the federal government
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.200]   was able to take down Silk Road.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.680]   And I wonder if all that's going to generate
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.440]   is another layer of best practices
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.720]   for underground transfer of materials.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   In many ways, isn't us reading about the takedown
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.160]   of this, just setting the stage for the next thing
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   to take its place, not unlike the Dread Pirate Roberts itself.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.360]   - Right.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.840]   - Well, let's talk a little bit about that.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.200]   Sorry, first Patrick, you, not Patrick,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.720]   I'm sorry, we've got two Patrick's in the show,
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.280]   so you have to be not Patrick.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.200]   You wanted to say something?
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.760]   - Yeah, it's by Twitter handle, so yeah, fair enough.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.480]   But yeah, you know, there are two really interesting things
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.440]   I think that we heard in this story.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.400]   First of all, you mentioned that the government
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.920]   sort of broke into the Tor network.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.080]   And in the case of Silk Road, at least,
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.640]   they didn't actually use any, you know,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.000]   they didn't break into that to get the identity of the guy.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They actually used pretty standard,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.840]   if you wanna boil it down to what it comes to,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.040]   it's a web search.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.080]   They found the guy through a forums,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.600]   it was on Stack Overflow, I think,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.160]   where he made a rookie mistake posting with his name
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.960]   for one minute and then changing it to his nickname.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.760]   So the anonymity of Tor from what I understand,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.840]   and Silk Road is kind of still intact.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.840]   And the other thing is you were talking about the fact
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.480]   that we could buy really trivial things
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.760]   on Silk Road as well.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.920]   Now, I personally never went there,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.880]   but a lot of what we're hearing from,
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.520]   I'm sorry, I forgot the name, Albridge.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.880]   - Right, right, Ross.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.400]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.120]   So he has some ideological,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.560]   at least the excuses he's giving are somewhat ideological.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.080]   He wants to create an anarchist experiment
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.280]   slash utopia with this tool.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.760]   Now, of course, there are things that contradict
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.400]   this ideology in the way he acts.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   But from what he's saying, it isn't intrinsically destined
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.080]   to be used for illegal activities.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.840]   - Right, I think there's actually a really good comparison
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.440]   here between Tor and Torrence.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.880]   By the way, the two are not the same
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.520]   for anyone who might be wondering about that,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.360]   in that people just associate Torrence with illegal stuff,
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.960]   with movies, but there are perfectly legitimate uses
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.680]   for a very good technology like Torrence.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.920]   Same thing goes for the onion router,
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.240]   for that anonymity network.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.960]   It could be used for many good things,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.320]   protecting dissidents in countries that are monitoring
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.480]   the internet, for making sure that your transactions
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.400]   aren't being monitored by a third party.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.040]   In fact, the same sort of security that's baked into Tor
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   has been emulated by several perfectly legitimate
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.840]   security vendors.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.920]   So I hope that this is not that moment
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.240]   when people just assume anyone running Tor
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.800]   must be a criminal.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.640]   - Patrick?
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.480]   - No, it's not.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.640]   And what's funny about this is not to get anything
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.720]   short about the NSA, but the NSA hates Tor
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.080]   because Tor is a wicked, rip and pain in the ass to crack
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.160]   and they don't have much success with it.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.080]   So there's some of the documents that have been released
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.360]   recently point out that the sort of the irritation
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.600]   that Tor brings to the NSA.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.760]   - Even though ironically the federal government finances
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.000]   what is it like 60% of Tor,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.920]   because they want to have a protected way for dissidents
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.560]   and for journalists to be able to report from
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.920]   within regimes overseas.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   - But those are the good dissidents Brian, right?
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.200]   - I mean the good ones, we want those.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.960]   - Don't even get that conversation started with this crew.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.200]   But what's funny though is,
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.680]   is there are, are's taking out a really good article
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.360]   on this and one of the things they do is,
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.520]   this was playing old fashioned police work
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.000]   on a large scale with the FBI, with a lot of subpoenas
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.640]   where they basically found one of the first mentions
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.480]   and who, you know, one of the first mentions was
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.840]   from Altoid on a site about mushrooms
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   and they referred a WordPress blog
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.080]   and that had been created and they worked their way,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.920]   they worked the case.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.680]   This wasn't the case of, this is like classic hard police work.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.000]   And it's kind of funny that this guy,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.280]   the Dred Private Roberts, you know,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.000]   Oldrich who was like very peace, love and understanding
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.520]   and against force was like,
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.720]   somebody's trying to blackmail my clients,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.480]   I'm going to call a hit out on them.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.040]   Which is, this is really, that's old school.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.880]   - That's exactly what happened.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.360]   - The old Jersey lower man, Hat and Def.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.760]   - He paid $80,000 to hire a hit man
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.360]   to take out a former associate.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.680]   And the FBI did an old fashioned sting.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.520]   They had someone pose as a hit man.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.760]   He transferred $80,000 in bitcoins,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.720]   boom, they had their proof
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.280]   and they went in to make the bust.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.880]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.560]   This story unfortunately will be seen by some as,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.680]   well, well, the Tor network is now insecure,
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.400]   the Tor network is forever doomed.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.880]   I don't think so, they didn't break
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.160]   the Tor network to make this work.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.440]   In fact, there was a bus not too long ago
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.720]   that dealing with freedom hosting ISP
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.440]   where people assumed that the government
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.200]   had taken over a layer of the Tor network
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.640]   to find the identities of people
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.120]   who were trading in kiddie porn.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.000]   That wasn't the case.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.960]   What they had done was they had hacked the servers
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.360]   that they were accessing and they installed malware,
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.800]   which infected the people who were visiting.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.240]   It's not quite old fashioned police work,
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.200]   but it's the same sort of thing.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.880]   They didn't bust the mechanism.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.960]   They busted the person on the other side of the screen.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.700]   Now, my question to not Patrick is,
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.280]   does that mean anything?
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.760]   Is that that fine line?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.480]   I mean, to say, look, the government did their job,
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.040]   they didn't violate what we think
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.200]   is the inalienable right to be anonymous on the internet,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.120]   but they did get some bad people.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.600]   - Well, it's definitely good that they got
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.200]   the guys they were looking for.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.120]   And I think it's also very good that they didn't
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.880]   either manage or need to crack Tor as a network,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.280]   because first of all, it would have validated
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   probably more surveillance somehow,
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.400]   with everything we've been talking about for a few months.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   The ability to crack something, defeat some anonymization
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:47.040]   system would have put more strength in the fact
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.320]   that they would need more of these kinds of tools.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.800]   Thankfully, they didn't manage to do that
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.680]   or they didn't need to do it.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.080]   It's also interesting that they're being maybe not quiet,
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.920]   but I mean, we're not hearing so much that,
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.000]   look, this is just good police work.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.920]   And I think that should be pointed out a little bit more.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.960]   Now, to come back to what you were saying earlier,
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.720]   you're saying that Tor is being viewed in a,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.840]   you know, with this suspect kind of people
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.160]   who use Tor must be doing something bad.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.640]   I personally haven't seen that all that much.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.360]   Silk Road, definitely.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.240]   But Tor is still sort of in that neutral gray area of,
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.480]   this is a tool and some people will use it for good stuff,
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.800]   some people for bad stuff.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.120]   Is that something that you guys are seeing in the US?
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.080]   That Tor is now suspect?
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.640]   - Man, I gotta be honest, like Tor is so sort of,
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.480]   - Underground?
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.800]   - I mean, even here, among the Twit audience,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.440]   we're having to explain what Tor is to a lot of people.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.480]   That's how fringe and underground it is.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.560]   I don't know that it really has a reputation
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.440]   that can be affected one way or the other,
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   but one parallel that I'd like to explore
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.960]   is in the days of, you know,
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.120]   using air quotes here, stealing music,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.200]   Napster ran Supreme and was the central hub
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.880]   by which everybody, you know, dealt with their music
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.360]   or got their illegal downloads.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.920]   And then once Napster went away,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.280]   you saw an increase in the anonymity side of thing.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.280]   You saw distributed hosting with BitTorrent
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.920]   and that became the way people started
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.480]   to share all their stuff.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.640]   Right now, if there's one person you don't want to be right now,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.200]   it's a client of Silk Road
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   because all the servers have been nabbed
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.400]   by the federal government.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.800]   They have all kinds of information that they're gonna use
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.560]   to track down people, whether it's, you know,
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.280]   people offering fraudulent whatever's or drugs or whatever.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.560]   Like all this crap is gonna roll downhill.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.320]   The head has been cut off for this beast
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.920]   and now they're gonna feast on the innards
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.840]   of all these lower level criminals.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.120]   Are we going to see the same thing again
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.640]   where now, all of a sudden,
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.920]   the next structure will induce
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.840]   or create some kind of double blindness to where,
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.200]   because that's probably right now,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.400]   if you're somebody who wants to sell, you know,
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   meth or cocaine or whatever, and you go to Silk Road,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.120]   you trust the reputation of Silk Road
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.360]   to be this repository that's above reproach.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.080]   And now you've seen that's not the case.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.160]   I would imagine that future clients of whatever
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.440]   takes its place will want some kind of,
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.240]   some kind of security on their end
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.880]   that they won't be able to, even if they get taken down,
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.040]   that they're not gonna be found out.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.480]   - You know, interesting security note here,
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.720]   we have been so focused on the transport layer,
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.960]   the pipe that takes data from one point to another.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.920]   That has to be encrypted, that has to be protected.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.720]   How dare the NSA spy on that?
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.320]   That we kind of forget that eventually,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.000]   that data ends up stored on a physical hard drive somewhere.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.720]   And if that physical hard drive gets confiscated,
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.280]   and if it hasn't been encrypted,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.360]   that it doesn't matter how well you encrypt
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.440]   your transport layer.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.280]   - Data is there for the taking?
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.080]   - Well, it also helps like one of the reasons
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.960]   servers are located in certain countries,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.920]   and they get routed access to a server.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.320]   You might have three or four jumps
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.120]   between the public and that server,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.400]   so that if someone does come after you legally,
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.920]   then they have to go through some of the most
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.960]   privacy sensitive courts or countries,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.200]   and fight their way through that
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.120]   to get the location of the actual servers,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.040]   and then get to that server,
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   they have to fight with that country,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.320]   that the server's located in,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.840]   and then hopefully you've been smart enough
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.080]   to encrypt all of that data.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.960]   But there's a reason why,
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.640]   there's a reason why I say Twitter,
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.360]   and not a Tor network was used,
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.000]   is there the Egyptian revolutions,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.960]   because it's easily accessible.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.600]   You can dump accounts, you can dump cell phones,
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.440]   but mostly because it was not really complicated to set up.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.600]   And setting up Tor and servers and encryption,
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.400]   and doing all of this is really hard.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.280]   In fact, the guy that set up the Silk Road
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.280]   basically didn't follow his own advice,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.800]   and left too much information around.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.480]   Actually, did you hear apparently the guy who got arrested
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.520]   might not be the original Dread Pirate Roberts?
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.600]   (laughing)
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.760]   It seems like, well, what he's saying at least is,
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.960]   I'm not the one who set this up.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.960]   The guy did it, and then bestowed upon me the title,
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.440]   and that title will be bestowed upon someone else?
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.600]   - Yeah, I heard that guy, he got it from actually
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   wasn't the original Dread Pirate Roberts either.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.800]   - Every night, before I went to bed, he said,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.920]   "Good work, I'll most likely kill you in the morning."
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.760]   And then one day, you know Patrick, all I can say is,
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.080]   as you wish.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:20.920]   - Oh man.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.840]   - Okay, there is another angle to the story
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.040]   that I would like to take, and it does more look
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.680]   at law enforcement, because no matter how we feel,
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.400]   yes, there is a level of law enforcement
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.040]   that we want to see on the internet,
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.400]   we want to see with ventures like this,
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.280]   because obviously Silk Road was not above board,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.200]   obviously they were using Tor to hide
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.040]   some pretty shady dealings,
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.240]   but then there are those who will point to this and say,
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.840]   see this is why the NSA needs to have backdoors
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.800]   into encryption, this is why the FBI needs to be able
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.280]   to have backdoors into our data centers.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.840]   And so I think I want to start this off with Schwood,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.240]   Schwood, I mean, if I'm not doing anything wrong,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.320]   I shouldn't fear, right?
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.720]   I should be totally fine with this.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.560]   - Oh my gosh, what is, what is,
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.480]   you are fishing with the stinkiest bait of all time,
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.680]   what is this?
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.840]   Look, here's the thing, and I almost wonder
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.000]   if the timing of this stuff,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.120]   who is to say if it was just the right time
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.800]   to take someone down, but I would imagine,
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.600]   if I was on the outside looking in,
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.200]   I would imagine that in the last, say, two or three months,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.080]   the popularity and the interest in browsers like Tor
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.000]   has gone through the roof, because we're hearing story
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.200]   after story of every kind of compromised thing,
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.400]   the NSA poking their face all over the place,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.480]   I would imagine that now would be a very good time,
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.280]   and I would imagine that internally,
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.080]   there would be a lot of pressure to show a win
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.520]   for defeating the bad guys by taking down
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.560]   somebody from behind an otherwise secure thing.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.240]   No, there's no case to be made
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.680]   that the NSA needs a backdoor.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.200]   If anything, this is in every way of validation
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.400]   for as you put it, traditional police work,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.320]   where you have people who know somebody,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.440]   who somebody makes a mistake and you take them down,
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.600]   and it was all done without breaking encryption.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.800]   So if anything, this is the evidence
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.880]   that we don't need any back doors.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.200]   - Breathe, breathe.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.520]   - Breathe, cleanse, cleanse, let it go.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.200]   - Fine, fine, we're all good here.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.520]   - Okay, now, not Patrick, you can give us
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.440]   the non-US-centric look at this.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.760]   What do you think about a government agency coming to you
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.120]   as a citizen and saying, look, we need help,
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.880]   old-fashioned police work isn't gonna cut it
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.800]   in this century, we need a way to look at
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.880]   these supposedly secure communications,
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.120]   but we promise, we promise we're only gonna look
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.960]   at the bad guys.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.960]   - Yeah, so that's the trick question, isn't it?
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.000]   I mean, if you wanna go really first layer,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.400]   then this is exactly what Schwood said.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.880]   You actually didn't need it in this case, so bad example.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.840]   If you wanna go really deep and philosophical,
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.200]   I think we've discussed this a million times,
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.840]   but I've never heard anyone actually explain
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.160]   why that question that you're asking is invalid,
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.160]   why people saying, you know, we're just gonna use it
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   to catch the bad guys or we just need to observe everything.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.520]   And the reason is everyone says, you know,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.240]   it has to do with freedom, it has to,
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.000]   but we don't have the actual explanation.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   The reason is, if you are being observed,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   think of your home, if you know that you're being observed
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.720]   in your home, then you are going to be acting differently.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.600]   When you're being observed, you're not being completely
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.880]   free to act as you want.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.040]   That means that your freedom is restricted
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.280]   when you're being observed, when you don't have somewhere
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.880]   some space of privacy for yourself.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.080]   So your freedom is actually being,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.480]   I can't believe I'm saying this,
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.240]   but is actually being attacked when you don't have a space
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   to be completely private, to be completely your own.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.080]   And it doesn't matter that it's in the physical space
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.360]   or that it is in the virtual internet space.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.920]   Now, if you want me to tell you about
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.560]   the outside of the US perspective,
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.840]   it's that you guys actually, in the US, I say, you know,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.520]   I generalize, you guys don't really care
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.640]   about people outside of the US.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.200]   The whole debate that you guys have been having is,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.480]   are we allowed to spy on American citizens or not?
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.200]   The outside of the US question is kind of settled.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.280]   So we're not so happy about that.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.480]   And personally, I would like to, you know,
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.560]   I would like the question to be,
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.480]   are you allowed to spy on everyone in general,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.920]   not just people in the US?
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.520]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.880]   I wasn't listening, not Patrick,
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.720]   'cause you're not from the US.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   (laughing)
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.800]   - Well, what had to do there?
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.960]   - Keep in mind, Patrick Beige is 100% right.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.760]   Like the NSA was founded on the idea,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.200]   like the whole thing that made my entire youth growing up,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.480]   you know, we knew about the NSA,
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.120]   we knew they listened to phone calls,
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.400]   but it was always international phone calls.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.720]   We had this bizarre fig leaf that like, as long as--
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   - It was always them. - It was always them.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.400]   - It was the other, and not us.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.560]   - Right, correct.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.400]   And it's astonishing to me that it's suddenly an issue
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.520]   because we know that they're watching us,
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.720]   they were always watching us.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.200]   It was a false dichotomy to begin with.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.880]   And I am hoping that if anything good
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.840]   can come of the horrific realizations that we have,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   is that maybe in an age where we are seeing the twilight
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.520]   of true privacy, we can establish robust methods
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.120]   to bring that back.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.400]   The idea that you could say something
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.440]   or be someone in one place
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.320]   and be someone totally different in another place,
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.920]   you know, there's all kinds of extraordinarily legitimate
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.000]   reasons for this because as many people have said before me,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.760]   you don't need freedom to say something smart
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.320]   and you certainly don't need freedom
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.720]   to say something popular.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.400]   You need freedom and you need the protections of freedom
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.080]   in order to say something unpopular, outrageous,
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.960]   ridiculous or crazy, which time and time again,
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.960]   we see that many of the most important ideas
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.400]   in the human race come from the fringes
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.040]   who say outrageous stupid things from the outside.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.120]   That otherwise-- - Wait a minute.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.600]   - They could say implies society.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.800]   - The twilight of true privacy, I gotta ask,
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.840]   what makes you think we're heading towards that?
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.200]   - Well, the fact that we all sparkle in the sunlight now
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.800]   and that though we had chicks keep watching us play baseball.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.280]   - Well, it happens to me anyways, but it's cool, it's cool.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.520]   No, but honestly, my stand has always been,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.560]   if you actually understand how the internet works,
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.520]   if you actually understand how networking works,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.000]   if you are accessing a server in any other part of the world,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.320]   I don't care if it's in the United States
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.840]   or in another country, you have to assume
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.440]   that your traffic is being intercepted.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.200]   It's just so easy to do it in a modern network.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.720]   So-- - Okay, and that is correct today,
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.320]   but there is no reason, Father,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.480]   that we can't create structures that are robust,
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.120]   that anonymize traffic.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.720]   We can create privacy only if we as a society
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.320]   decide that it's okay for us to live,
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   thrive, and survive in a world
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.360]   where somebody cannot know something.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.600]   And that's something right now,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.200]   where we're at the dawn of this era of sharing,
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.720]   and we all are fascinated with the fact
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.680]   that we could tweet out photos of our breakfasts,
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.200]   but we are losing something.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.480]   And I think stories like this make us realize
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.600]   that maybe there's a value to a segregation
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.880]   of different parts of our lives,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.960]   these firewalls between our public and private lives,
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.000]   I think is important, and I'm hoping that we will decide
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.480]   as a society to create more structures
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.320]   that make that possible.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.280]   - Okay, let's go off the rails completely.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.240]   There was a story this last week
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.040]   about how Google is trying to implement
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.000]   sort of a true authentication system.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.040]   They want it tied to your Google+ account
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.360]   when you're commenting on YouTube,
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.160]   because their belief is if people have to use
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.560]   their real identities that we would reduce
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.760]   the amount of trolls,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.960]   we would reduce the amount of online bullying.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.680]   If we did head into a society
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.840]   where there was a guarantee of true anonymity,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.760]   how do we then defend against the trolls?
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.840]   - Well, it's not one or the other.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   It's not, I mean, you can have different uses
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.200]   for different cases, it doesn't have to be,
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.680]   everyone is absolutely anonymous,
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.760]   or everyone is absolutely using their real name,
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.320]   because in both cases you're gonna have problems.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.200]   And I would like to disagree with something
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.240]   that you both said, Padre and Brian.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.120]   Brian, you said that we didn't have,
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.280]   people were listening all the time before,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.720]   and that was, we knew it,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.360]   and it's always been the case.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.600]   It's not true, it hasn't been the case.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.840]   - Well, hold on, hold on, not Padre,
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.040]   'cause what Padre said is that packets
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.920]   have always been exposed on the internet,
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.200]   and any server in between hither and yawn
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.360]   can make you copy those packets or look at them.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.120]   - That's what Brian was saying.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.760]   He was saying that the NSA would listen to you,
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.920]   but what Padre said was,
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.400]   anyone could be listening to you.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.920]   I mean, at least that's, I think what you mean.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.200]   It's true that information on the internet
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.440]   is theoretically available to pretty much anyone.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.200]   But there's a difference between that
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.160]   and the government looking at all of it.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.520]   It's like you're walking down the street
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.680]   and you know that someone could be looking at you,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.160]   but it's different in every street,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.680]   in every city, in the country,
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.800]   is layered with cameras that are looking at you
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.160]   and analyzing what you do all the time.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.240]   I'm not saying one is better than the other.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.720]   I have my opinion on this, but it's irrelevant here.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.440]   I'm just saying it is a different thing,
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.320]   and you can't equate them both.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   All the information being available for anyone
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.880]   to potentially observe on the internet
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.320]   is different from the NSA having arrays of servers
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.200]   looking and analyzing everything.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.000]   - And I completely agree with that.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.400]   It's also amazing, like Bruce Schneider,
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.520]   did a great article for The Guardian,
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.360]   where he points out,
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.240]   "The NSA has inserted all these exploits into services."
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.360]   And it's like Snowden basically went out and said,
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:10.360]   "Yo, world, and the United States went, oh, and the rest of the world, but oh God."
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.800]   But what that means is that all of these services
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.240]   that thought they were relatively secure
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.400]   have found out in many cases,
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.200]   there's just big old giant holes walking in,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.160]   or have basically been publicly exposed
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.520]   that they were compelled to do things
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.160]   that are kind of curious and unpleasant.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.120]   And what's interesting is that it undermines trust,
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.680]   there's obviously undermined trust in the US.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.000]   The fact that all of this information,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.280]   and I agree with not Padre,
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.520]   all this information being warehouse is incredibly creepy
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   and incredibly unsettling,
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.240]   especially all you gotta do is go back to Nixon
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.200]   who is tasking the FBI to dig up information on his enemies list.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.560]   It was like 600 or 800 people long,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.160]   and targeting the FBI to generate information
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.320]   that could be used against this political enemies.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.680]   This is scary stuff.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.640]   This is like less than 40, 45 years ago in the United States.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.840]   This is a big deal.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.760]   And I don't wanna say anything against the people
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.760]   that work at the NSA,
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.560]   'cause I've met some of them,
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.640]   they seem to be fine people,
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.680]   and I would love for terrorism to be stopped,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.400]   and I believe in signals intelligence,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.560]   but at some point it gets out of hand.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:17.960]   - If I can, let me move things back to Padre S.J.'s question,
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.720]   which was how does this tie in with the movement
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.600]   towards real identities on YouTube
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.920]   using Google+ for the comments?
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   In no way does that shift actually reveal true identities.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.360]   Instead, what it does is it creates an environment
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.880]   where your reputation matters.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   If your reputation is this particular identity,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.600]   you could have five different identities,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.880]   you can have five different names,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.840]   and you could create backstories for all of them
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.480]   and histories and you could comment on each of them.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   But the ability to hide behind an anonymous brand new name
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.240]   and be given the exact same weight
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.000]   as somebody who has commented
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   and been upvoted hundreds of times beforehand,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.480]   the fact that that false equality
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.720]   is no longer under the new system,
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.120]   that is significant.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.480]   Nobody will ever know who you are.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.960]   You can live your life as a banker
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.960]   and leave comments as a transsexual prostitute or whatever.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.440]   But as long as you create that persistent reality--
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.360]   - Brian have to be spying on me again.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.240]   (both laughing)
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.120]   - Okay, wait, wait, we gotta go to an ab,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.720]   but before that, I do wanna tackle one little addendum
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.080]   to this and that is if there could be a way
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.280]   to create an online identity, that's completely anonymous.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.080]   It's a third party that we trust
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.240]   that ties it to your real name
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.520]   so we can guarantee that you only have one of these.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.840]   That is your online identity.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.520]   It cannot be tracked back to you,
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.440]   but you have to now protect it.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.880]   You can't just say ridiculous, trollish stuff on the internet
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.960]   because that actually affects your reputation.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.480]   Would that be acceptable to both the people
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.240]   who want accountability and the people who want privacy?
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.080]   Patrick.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.400]   - Well, it still won't interrupt the fact
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.680]   that some people are scum or some people have no filter
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.960]   or some people are just sacks of evil with keyboards
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.200]   and they will say nasty things
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.600]   even if we know who they are.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.720]   The second thing is there will never be a third party
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.880]   or a first party that will be able to eliminate
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.680]   all people spoofing identities
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.480]   and creating fake identities on the internet, even Google.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.280]   - Right, right.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.360]   - The solution is clearly,
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.840]   we can look to World of Warcraft
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.040]   because there are characters,
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.400]   there is, when I play an MMO,
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.720]   I have my favorite character
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.680]   who I want to do best practices on
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.560]   to get farthest ahead possible.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.360]   If I wanna do something stupid,
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.800]   I make a brand new level one character
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.920]   and then do something stupid
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.800]   because that's a disposable character.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.680]   What the level one character does
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.000]   has a smaller impact in that world
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.080]   than what the level 60 character does.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.320]   And likewise, that's the way it should be with comments.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.280]   In comments, a brand new account with no backstory
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.440]   should have a lower ability
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.920]   to impact the world around them with what he has to say
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.720]   unless what he has to say is voted up, you know,
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.960]   Reddit style and makes an impact on the community
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.520]   by the sheer merit of what it has to say.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.240]   But the ability to fling poo at a wall
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.200]   should not be equal to a real verified ID
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.080]   versus a brand new made one
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.280]   and this is their first comment.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.680]   - You know, only if we had someone who worked for Blizzard.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.080]   - No comment, absolutely no comment on that.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.160]   However, I will say two things.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.080]   First of all, it's very surprising that it took so long,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.560]   actually the surprising thing is that it took so long
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.640]   for Google to implement that in YouTube.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.800]   It's been an issue for a long time
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   and I think the normal situation is that the comments
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.160]   are a little bit more tied to an identity, you know,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.440]   than it currently is.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.160]   The other thing is actually we should probably try
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.800]   and get someone from Korea, from South Korea
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.040]   to discuss this topic because if I'm not mistaken,
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.760]   they have this exact system that you were talking about,
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.880]   Padre, they have a unique identifier per person
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.560]   that every service on the web has to use
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.840]   to identify someone.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.080]   And so basically there is no way to hide.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.880]   It's not even that they can have multiple identities.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.000]   They can only have their own identity,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.240]   including forums and any service on the web.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.520]   I'm sure there are ways to circumvent that,
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.440]   but that's the way the system is designed.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.680]   So it would be pretty interesting to have someone
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.080]   from there tell us about it.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   Now guys, I know we could go on forever about this topic,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.640]   but I'm gonna call a halt to it.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.000]   We're gonna come back briefly to talk about
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   just a little bit of a tangent,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.320]   but before we do that,
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.040]   I wanna take time to talk about our first sponsor
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:38.880]   and that's Audible.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.080]   This episode of Twit was sponsored by Audible.com.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.680]   I remember when the first time I listened to Audible,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.720]   I didn't quite get it.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   I didn't understand why I'd wanna be listening to books.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.360]   And it wasn't until I actually got busy that I realized,
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.680]   yeah, this is a really good way to catch up on the books,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.680]   on the titles, on the literature that people tell me
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.360]   I should be big on.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.960]   Just this last week I was on my way over to New York.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.240]   I knew I had a five hour flight.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.080]   I knew it was gonna be red.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.880]   I don't sleep on planes all that well.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.400]   So I called back an old faithful favorite
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.960]   and listened to it in audio form.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.920]   I had already read it, but I listened to Ready Player One.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.360]   Have you read that book?
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.600]   - I have read that book.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.400]   - It's one of those books I desperately want turned
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.840]   into a movie.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.280]   And it was actually narrated by Will Wheaton,
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.720]   which was a wonderful thing,
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.320]   'cause I'm hearing Will Wheaton in my head
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.360]   and picturing everything that's going on in the book
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.280]   and suddenly the Starship Enterprise shows up.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.560]   No, no, that didn't happen, but it is a really good way
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.120]   to catch up on those books that you've always wanted to read,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.080]   but you just didn't have the time for it.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.880]   Now, you see, for those who wanna give Audible a try,
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.080]   we have a wonderful chance here at Twitch

[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.400]   I'd like you to go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.640]   That's audible.com/twit, the number two,
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.240]   and see if maybe audible might be the thing
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.560]   that you're missing in your literary life.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.640]   That's audible.com/twit2,
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.160]   and we thank audible for their support of this week in tech.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:50.000]   Slightly a different story, but still kind of connected
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.080]   to Silk Road is all about Bitcoin.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.800]   Bitcoin has been in the news recently,
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.720]   and never more so than when they busted Silk Road
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.320]   and realized that they just took a big chunk
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.920]   of the Bitcoins available in the world out of circulation.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.600]   Now, let's have a little bit of a historical love fest
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.440]   about Bitcoin.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.040]   It was first introduced for trading in December 30th, 2010.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   They started trading at about 30 cents per Bitcoin,
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.320]   and not all that promising.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.280]   Now, the dread pirate Roberts posted about Bitcoin
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.160]   on his blog on January 27th, 2011,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.760]   and just a few days later, Bitcoin was at parity
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.640]   with the US dollar.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.400]   So there is a tie-in between Silk Road and Bitcoin.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.760]   It was really one of the first places that showed people
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.800]   that there was a market for Bitcoins,
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.040]   and there was a place to use it.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.400]   Now, on June 7th of this year,
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.320]   Bitcoin hit $30 per Bitcoin.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.760]   Remember that there was a big chunk of news
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.760]   during the cycle where people were trying to farm Bitcoins
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.280]   because they had become the new market,
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.280]   and especially when the dollar was weak.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.600]   It seemed like a good investment.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.560]   Now, with the takedown of Silk Road,
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.720]   we saw Bitcoin value kind of plummet a little bit
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.680]   and recover slightly.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.120]   But all of this points to Bitcoin
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.560]   actually being a real currency.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.120]   It's acting like a currency should act, right?
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.360]   I mean, this is what you would expect from a currency
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.040]   that's not make-believe, that's not just there,
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.840]   but it reacts to world conditions.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.840]   It reacts to the demand for the currency.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.280]   Does this, the busting of Silk Road,
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.040]   verify that yes, Bitcoin is a real currency
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.840]   that will continue?
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.720]   Well, the FBI is-
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   So?
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.880]   Oh, Patrick first.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.720]   Oh, I was-
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.360]   Yo, go ahead, Patrick.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.080]   (laughing)
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   It's funny, there's an article on Forbes that says,
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.120]   so they seized about 26,000 Bitcoins.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.680]   The thing is that's not the 600,000 Bitcoins
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.640]   that actually belong to the Dread Pirate Roberts,
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.960]   which is apparently about 5% of all the Bitcoin
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   currently in existence.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.360]   But what it does say is the FBI was like,
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.040]   we're gonna hold onto them till after the legal,
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.360]   basically they're gonna hold onto them
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.520]   through the prosecution, the trial, whatever happens,
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.000]   and then quote, "We will probably just liquidate them."
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.480]   So whether or not you believe it's a legitimate currency,
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.520]   it's certainly being treated by the FBI
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   as legitimate commodity to be sold for the maximum bid.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.800]   So the FBI at least wants the price of Bitcoins
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.720]   to stay high for the foreseeable future.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.560]   Right, right.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.000]   I'm sure I think you were gonna jump up
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.880]   with some Bitcoin goodness.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.000]   Well, specifically I'm fascinated by the fact that
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Bitcoin has a reputation of being like,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.160]   "Oh, that's what you'd use to bad drugs
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.280]   "or do illegal bull stuff."
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.160]   The question that is fascinating to me
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.360]   is that we saw what, a 15% drop, right?
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.720]   Essentially, the hub of all the dirtiest, filthiest,
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.600]   most Bitcoin-associated malfeasance
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.280]   was shut down all at once,
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.040]   and it only affected the Bitcoin economy 15%.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   Can you imagine?
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.160]   I mean, what would happen to the Chinese Yuan
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.320]   if all of online piracy in China were shut down overnight?
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.160]   I would suspect that there would be more than a 15% effect
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.000]   on that.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.880]   Right, or what would happen to the US dollar
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.160]   if Apple just got seized by the US government?
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.000]   Yeah, sure.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.720]   We're talking about the same sort of effect
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.800]   that was the big player in the Bitcoin community.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.680]   And yeah, I think Patrick, you're absolutely right.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.120]   The fact that the F behind is holding onto it,
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.160]   they understand that it's worth something.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.600]   It's not just a virtual number that they can get rid of
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.080]   because it's gonna go away after the seizure.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.520]   They see that, yeah, this is something
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.400]   that people have traded.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.280]   It has value even though it only exists in a computer.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.440]   Yeah, it's kind of funny.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.080]   The general, depending on whether you refer to the Silk Road
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.000]   in terms of the number of Bitcoins processed
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.680]   or the actual value, but the number being bandied
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.320]   about in US dollars right now is like $1.2 billion in trade,
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.920]   yielding like $80 million in profit for Obrick.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.840]   And it's kind of funny to think about that as, you know,
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.760]   it'll be curious, I think,
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.160]   should looking forward over the next six to 10 weeks.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.680]   Because right now, okay, there was a hit,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.440]   there was a temporary hit, there was a panic,
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.800]   people started to sell them off.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.080]   I've got a Bitcoin, I have to sell them
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.360]   before my mom finds them, right?
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.920]   Because my mom's gonna think I'm buying drugs.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.120]   But what's kind of interesting is like,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.280]   what's gonna happen at this point
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.320]   is will there be an ongoing market, right?
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.280]   Because 5% of the Bitcoins on the planet, you know,
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.040]   the FBI is trying to find that wallet.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.560]   Once the FBI finds that wallet,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.400]   they own like one and every 20 Bitcoins.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.320]   But that still means the vast majority of Bitcoins
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.480]   were circulating back and forth, right?
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.080]   Doing what currency is supposed to do in a healthy economy.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.640]   So the $64,000 question is,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.080]   will the value of those continue to rise
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.560]   because there are other avenues for exchange for the Bitcoins?
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.640]   Or will it turn out that this was like
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.760]   where all of the Bitcoins were traveling?
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.920]   And there's, does that make sense?
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.760]   'Cause I can't speak economies without sending
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.600]   like an idiot.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.680]   - I got it, but there's also a story attached to that.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.520]   And that is, there are many users of Silk Road
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.680]   who are now complaining that, well, they're out.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.200]   They're out tremendous sums of money
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.720]   because the way that it works is you have to deposit
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.040]   your Bitcoins, well, wait, you used to work,
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.800]   into Silk Road and then you could actually
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.600]   make a transaction, you could make that trade,
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.960]   you could make that buy, you could make it sale.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.000]   And there are people who are saying,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.840]   "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.040]   "I had $10,000 in Bitcoins in Silk Road.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.960]   "You can't prove I did anything illegal.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.080]   "How could you just take that away from me?"
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.600]   - Well, it depends on who.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.440]   - I'm sure that--
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.000]   - I mean, look, it's like you bought credits.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.040]   You bought credits in a fantasy world
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.000]   where you'd get drugs and pedophiles,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.640]   and now those credits are gone.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.120]   They were gone the moment you spent it
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.760]   and the fact that the company shut down
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.160]   before you got a chance to spend them,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.040]   look, man, if World of Warcraft went away,
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.720]   I'm sorry, not Patrick.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.960]   I wouldn't say I bought all this gold
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.440]   and where's my value?
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.840]   I'd understand that the company's gone.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.040]   - I don't really think it's the same thing.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.240]   I think if the US is interested in,
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.400]   well, let's even put aside the fact
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.200]   that the agency wants to sell them back
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.400]   once the prosecution has concluded.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.360]   I'm half sure that they will have a phone number,
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.440]   and if you wanna get your Bitcoins back,
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.680]   and you can call up the phone number,
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.800]   say this is what I use them for, he are the records,
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.000]   and please give them back,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.840]   and I'm sure they will be happy to give them back.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.040]   Of course, I'm also pretty certain
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.520]   that no one is ever going to do that,
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.680]   but if it is considered real value,
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.920]   and I believe it is,
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.600]   I'm sure the US can,
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.600]   the agency can give it back.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.360]   - But would they?
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.960]   I think that would be a--
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.800]   - Why not?
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.640]   - Why not?

[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.880]   - Why is it Microsoft issue to security update for this yet?
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:38.240]   Because there's a Microsoft fix it, and I love Microsoft fix it because it's a strange little
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.120]   remote thing where it fixes your machine, but as long as it's secure.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:47.120]   But why hasn't Microsoft implemented this patch yet?
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.880]   - I think it's because most people at Microsoft use Firefox.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.880]   - Shwam.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.880]   - Okay, no, sorry.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.840]   No, this should, this is a critical vulnerability.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.600]   I mean, this scared me more than anything.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.840]   A lot of vulnerabilities look scary, but you know, they're so hard to pull off.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.440]   - Robert, what is it that's special about Internet Explorer that makes this vulnerability
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.080]   uniquely possible on it?
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   I understand there, you know, there's, is there anything theoretically that says that
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.680]   a similar type of attack couldn't happen on other browsers?
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.800]   - Well, technically I guess it could, but they don't use the same DLLs.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:29.760]   The problem here was the way that IE is written and the dynamic linking libraries that it
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.080]   uses aren't really locked down.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.080]   Not that well.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.880]   I mean, because remember, you're always balancing accessibility, flexibility, the ability to
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.720]   use a platform with the ability to keep it secure.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.280]   This is one of those oopsies.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.720]   They never thought that someone would be injecting themselves in this way, and now
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.960]   they're getting burned.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.640]   That's basically the history of security vulnerabilities in Windows or any other platform.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.640]   - Wait, somebody will climb in through an open window?
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.960]   Somebody open an unlocked door.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.240]   Okay, they can open a locked door if it's a bad lock.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.040]   Okay, they'll, you know what I mean?
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.360]   It's like, it's this, it's layer of crazy, but it's, I love the, the, the CVEMiter.org
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.360]   entry on this.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.840]   "Use after free vulnerability in the set mouse capture implementation in MSHTML.dll,
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.720]   Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 11 allows remote attackers to execute an arbitrary
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.720]   code.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.560]   It's just obscure and it's in the IE DLLs."
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.000]   You know, there will be other horrible security problems in the other browsers that just
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.240]   don't happen to be this particular one, Brian.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.240]   - Yeah, sure, sure.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.880]   - But you know, I see the tie-in to our previous discussion because, again, people are always
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.800]   concerned about the transport layer, that, that pipe I have to the internet being spied
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   on.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.360]   When, honestly, it's a lot easier to compromise either the end user's computer or the end
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.920]   user himself, or the server that the user is accessing.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.240]   So, you know, really, this is, this is the stuff we should be worried about.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.960]   This is the stuff that we should be concerned about.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.800]   My computer could be owned right now if I had ever actually used Internet Explorer, and
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   I wouldn't have a clue that someone had just accessed all the sites that I had accessed
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   on my browser.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800]   Nothing.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   - So there.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   - Take that Steve Ballers.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   - Speechless.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   - Speechless.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.840]   - No, I'm still thinking like this is also a great excuse to blame some horrible thing
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   on your computer.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   It's not me, Mom, it's this Metasploit.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.240]   - My brother ran Metasploit.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240]   - Yeah.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.880]   - Oh, we should mention that there is a fix right now.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.480]   Hopefully we'll drop it into the show notes.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:30.800]   Microsoft did issue a fix it in the, what, mid September or so?
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.840]   So, if you are using IE, if you're stuck with IE, if you love IE, please, please don't
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.080]   serve to another site until you have run that tool.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:44.520]   - I would say actually, period, if you are on a Windows box, just run this.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520]   - All right.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.240]   - Just do it, just in case.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.240]   - Yeah.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.760]   - Okay, you know, okay, guys, I'm done.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   I'm sick of it.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.680]   Forget the hacking, forget Tor, forget encryption.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.920]   Let's go on to something else in the news.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.560]   - Yeah, well, that's good news for a change, Bob.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.560]   - Yeah, good news.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.560]   Good news.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.560]   Here we go.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.440]   So Adobe just got hacked and evidently they lost a bunch of credit cards and source code.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   How's that?
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440]   That sounds good Steve?
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.520]   - Well, it's not very bad, right?
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:15.720]   When you say hacked, you mean like somebody just got into some nonsensical side job.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.320]   It won't affect like clients of Adobe.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.320]   - Right, no, no.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.480]   - We were close to corporate business, right?
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.080]   - It was really non-consequential.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.880]   It was just 40 gigabytes with the data.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.880]   - 40 gigabytes?
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.680]   - Look, I got 40 gig, I got terabytes of data.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.680]   What's 40 gigs?
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.720]   What could be in that 40 gigs that would be such a big deal, man?
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.680]   - Well, I mean, the little bit of about 2.9 million customer credit cards.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:45.680]   - 2.9 million customer credit cards was just hacked from Adobe.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   - 2.9 million.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.640]   - Pretty much anyone who's a client of Adobe or Adobe's core business may be a little bit
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.640]   compromised.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:06:00.040]   - Well, and the source code for Acrobat, which means reader, which means that people now
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.840]   have a much better way to compromise it.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:06.200]   - Because PDF files, they're going away, right?
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   - They're not popular.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.960]   - If you thought your Adobe reader was insecure before, now that the bad guys have the actual
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:18.960]   source code, now this is, they're really trying to downplay it and they're doing one
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.200]   of these things where I don't think they know how to respond to it.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.200]   So they said, yeah, we've been breached, but it's not that bad.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.840]   And as details keep trickling out, it's turning out how bad it was.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.560]   First it was, there's been a breach, we're not sure what was taken.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:38.600]   Then there was, there's a breach and we think some credit cards have been exposed, but it
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.880]   was all the encrypted stuff.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.040]   Then it became, well, there's 2.9 million credit cards and accounts that have been exposed.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:48.840]   And now it's, and they may have walked away with source code for some of our most popular
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.840]   products.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.840]   - All right.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:57.200]   So keeping in, in, you know, theme with my predisposition to be counterintuitive here,
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:03.280]   is this a weird time to remind people that in cases of fraud, your liability is zero with
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   your credit cards.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   - Your liability is $50.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.160]   - Look, no, no, it was, but I believe even that seemed gone.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.920]   I mean, I'm no expert, but I believe for years it was, it was $50 was the maximum liability,
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.680]   but I believe it's zero now.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.760]   But essentially your liability is zero.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:24.000]   And there, it's easy and fun for us to say, you know, oh, look, you know, I hate to be
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.440]   one of those credit cards or whatever.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:31.600]   But the truth is, if you look at your bill, I got signed up once for a $9 free trial for
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.280]   some, you know, a sahi berry crap or whatever.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:41.960]   And I went ballistic, changed my credit card number, called and got it rejected on there.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:48.040]   It's astonishingly easy to deal with fraud in this digital age as long as you pay attention
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.040]   to your bill.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.200]   And the penalties are astonishingly low.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.000]   If somebody tries to be fraudulent with it.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.680]   - Unless it turns out that they managed to hit your combined debit credit card, wipe out
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:03.600]   the contents of your bank account, cause you to bounce a bunch of checks, including maybe
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.240]   your rent check and you have to turn around, cancel that card, reissue your numbers, and
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.920]   then to figure out whether or not you're going to keep that separate or apart and then create
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.240]   a whole new set of online payment accounts for that.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.040]   - First of all, that's why I don't do debit cards.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.600]   I want something to talk about.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.520]   But second of all, I believe, again, I believe that's been updated recently to where the
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.880]   liability is zero for debit cards as well.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:28.480]   Theoretically now, the liability may be zero, but it can still be taken away.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.000]   The liability may be zero, but it can still really screw up your life.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   - Sure, sure.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.040]   - There's nothing like having someone use your credit card.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   It's not you.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.480]   It's just manning, which is why not Patrick only deals in crugrands.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   - Bitcoin.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.480]   - Bitcoin.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.160]   - I was lying before.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.560]   But no, I mean, I'm with Brian.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.280]   I mean, it's obviously a big deal.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:09:00.480]   I think the bigger deal might be the source code for all the PDF tools we use could be
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.680]   potential time bombs now.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.240]   So that's, I think, a bigger deal than the credit card.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:12.880]   Obviously, it's a problem, but the credit card thing, the liability, yes, you could be
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:18.960]   in a situation where your account is emptied and then your check's bounce.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.960]   That's absolutely true.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:27.680]   But overall, it's something that we kind of, it's an inconvenience that we agree everyone
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:33.120]   collectively as a society to live with in order to get the convenience of having a credit
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.720]   card or a debit card.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:43.200]   The source code issues might be something that are actually making the whole environment
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.200]   a lot less safe.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.200]   - Right.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   See, that's the thing for me.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   Credit cards are one thing.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   And it makes for a good story.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.400]   So, oh, it's 15 million credit cards.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.920]   And it sounds like it's a bad thing.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.480]   But honestly, that system pretty much polices itself.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:01.160]   If you've got a lot of credit card breaches, the end user, you, you're not going to be
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.200]   financially affected all that much, even though it can be a major annoyance and convenience,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.200]   so on, so forth.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.000]   I don't want to minimize that.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.440]   The source code part of this story is what scares me because imagine this.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:17.760]   Imagine how many times we've heard of a vulnerability with Adobe, with Adobe Reader, with Adobe
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.760]   products.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:26.120]   Now, the way that vulnerabilities were exposed was they kept hammering at the executables.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.360]   They kept hangering at the services until they found holes and then they would exploit
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.360]   those holes.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.840]   They don't have to do that anymore.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.640]   If they have the source code, they can actually go line by line and find out from inside where
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.120]   the weaknesses are going to be, which means they can find weaknesses that they would never
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.920]   have been able to find just by hammering on the executables.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.360]   This is actually horrible.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:50.840]   I mean, imagine how much of the world depends on Adobe products, specifically on Adobe
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840]   Reader.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.760]   Now, imagine what would happen if all those computers were suddenly owned.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:56.280]   Let's go back to the exploit.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.720]   Let's say that now that same exploit works in Firefox.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   It works in Chrome.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.360]   It works just you sitting at your desktop.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.720]   That's the kind of access that we're talking about if someone actually has the source code
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.240]   of software you're running on your system.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.560]   It's also, I mean, it's pretty brutal.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.360]   Like, okay, 2.9 million customer credit cards.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.400]   Those were encrypted, assuming it's quality encryption.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.120]   That data is probably pretty safe.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.960]   But it's crazy, right?
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:27.680]   This appears to be a group of hackers that have broken into LexusNexus, done in Bradstreet,
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.280]   a whole bunch of other interesting places.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.360]   What happened was I'm reading Krebs on security.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:40.920]   Alex Holden, CISO, hold security LLC discovered a massive 40 gigabyte source code Trove stashed
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.320]   on a server used by these cyber criminals.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.040]   What's interesting is not so much that they had the source code, but they cracked into
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.800]   the credit card servers and then used that to get access to the right of stuff Adobe's
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.800]   system.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:01.480]   There's some really bad lack of firewall going on there or some really sophisticated hacking.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.560]   If I'm reading correctly Adobe's response, Adobe is still in the process of determining
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.360]   what source code for other products may have been accessed by the attackers.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.480]   Which basically means the attackers could have been planting things in the source code to
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.160]   do nefarious stuff later on, which is really frightening for something that is...
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.320]   I think that sounds a little bit ambitious for this one attack.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.600]   But the spectrum of possibility is terrifying.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.680]   This isn't one attack.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.440]   This was something that they just discovered.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.240]   The reason they discovered it is because the security officer working on something else
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:37.960]   stumbled across 40 gigabytes of code, took some screenshots and went to Adobe and said,
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.760]   "Does this look familiar?"
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.960]   And Adobe went, "Yes, that looks familiar."
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:48.080]   I always heard Chad, there was something wrong with his mic if we could wind that back.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.920]   I may have muted.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:55.200]   We are looking at the malware analysis and exploring the different digital assets we have.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.080]   Right now the investigation is really into the trail of breadcrumbs of where the bad
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.440]   guys touched.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.560]   Which is another way of saying, "Yeah, we know they got this.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.080]   We don't know what else they got."
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.040]   And what they did with it, where it's going.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.600]   I feel like all of the Twit Network should put together a get well soon card.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.560]   We can just have the whole Internet sign in and send it over.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.480]   I smell an NSFW episode.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.480]   We just...
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.000]   You know what, Adobe, we know you've been feeling under the weather.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.400]   This is from all of us.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.760]   These fix your...
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.760]   Patrick.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.320]   Okay, Patrick.
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:35.440]   So let's go back over to the man who can give us the non-American view of this.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.080]   I'm losing my cookies over this.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.880]   Does this sound like as big of a story for you as it does for me?
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.640]   I think you might have a slightly more vested interest in this story because that's your
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.800]   bread and butter.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.600]   But yeah, it's definitely scary.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.400]   The thing is not being a security expert.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:02.680]   I'm kind of in the shoes of the guy who sees it on the eight o'clock news and he's being
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   told...
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.680]   Oh, holy...
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:11.760]   It's really horrible and the world is gonna end and I'm like, wait, what?
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.600]   What should I do?
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.200]   Like, what's happening?
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.760]   Can I be safer by doing something?
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:19.760]   So it's...
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.240]   Yes, stop using the Internet.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.960]   Well, there you have it.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.200]   Our advice to you is turn off the Internet right now.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.200]   Let's all go home.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.480]   The lesson from this episode.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   Sorry.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.320]   Stop using the Internet.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.360]   But yeah, no, it's definitely scary for us too.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:42.880]   We use PDFs all the time and it's ubiquitous and international.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:46.480]   So yeah, to answer your question, it's scary for us as well.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.840]   Now, Patrick pulled up a security bulletin from Adobe saying that they're gonna be releasing
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.560]   a patch in a few days.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.560]   My question is...
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.560]   Oh, please.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560]   How do you patch this?
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560]   They have this...
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.560]   Well...
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.560]   You can't...
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.720]   No, no, no, no, they didn't say it would actually fix anything.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:03.280]   They just wanted you to know that there's a patch that'll be coming out soon.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.880]   It's gonna make your images clearer.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.720]   It has nothing to do with this thing.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:07.720]   Well, yeah, update...
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.400]   Yeah, basically update to...
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.560]   Yeah, check for updates on October 8th, that's all I'm gonna say.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.720]   For Adobe Reader and Acrobat 11.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.720]   This is honestly...
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.000]   This is one of those things where you cannot patch this.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.240]   If they have the source code, unless you're rewriting the entire software...
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.240]   Let's hide it from scratch.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:28.400]   Well, unless they found something in the source code that they need to fix...
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.400]   Oh, wait.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.360]   Unless they're saying, okay, so we finally started going through our source code and
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.640]   we found all those holes so we're gonna fix them before they get to them.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.640]   I don't know.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.400]   Yeah, well, it's funny.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.080]   The Adobe Secure Software Engineering Team, the Asset Blog, they also say, it's kind of
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.080]   funny.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.640]   At the same time, they're saying on October 2nd, we are not aware of any zero-day exploits
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.640]   targeting any Adobe products.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.360]   Adobe announces that they will be doing security patches for their products.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.360]   So...
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360]   Go Adobe.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360]   So clean that code.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.360]   How is it...
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   How is it different?
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.360]   Get less noon.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.360]   Different from other zero-day exploits.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.680]   Okay, well, it's a great question.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.960]   How is this different from other zero-day exploits?
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   The reason...
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.920]   The way that this is different is because when we're talking about a zero-day exploit,
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.920]   it's typically...
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.720]   It's been created by a couple of...
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.880]   I'll call them security researchers who have been hammering at a service until they find
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:20.880]   a hole.
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.080]   They find a way either to overload the stack so they can inject their own code or they've
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:30.320]   just found some sort of weakness in the way that data is transferred to and from the service.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.280]   This is different because they're not attacking.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.640]   They're not hammering at it.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.720]   They actually have the blueprints.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.760]   It would be like the difference between someone breaking into a building by going and checking
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.840]   all the windows if they're open and someone actually having the blueprints from the building
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.920]   so they know, "Oh, there's an access shaft down there I can get through."
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.920]   That's what we're looking at.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920]   Sure.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920]   That's what we're looking at.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.280]   Once you see they're in the building, you can go and lock that access shaft in the same
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.200]   way that you would, you know, closing the window that was open, couldn't you?
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:03.200]   Well, yeah, but I mean, they don't know which of the thousand different ways to approach
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.920]   this building are going to be used by the attackers.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.920]   That's what we're looking at.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:17.440]   The quantity and the ease with which people who want to exploit these issues in the software
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.720]   is what makes this dangerous.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:24.160]   There's going to be more and possibly better hidden attacks.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.160]   Right.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.560]   Oh, put it, put it, how about this?
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.960]   Here's a better way to think about it.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:33.160]   If I'm going to run a standard exploit against the service, I have to try 10,000 different
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.960]   things before I get the one thing that works.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.320]   And so if I'm a good security person, I'm actually looking at all those attempts and
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.000]   I realize, okay, something's brewing, something's trying to get in.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.040]   If I have the source code, my attack works the first time and you have no time to prepare
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.120]   because I've never attacked your system except for the one time that it worked.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.120]   That's how that ends.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.200]   Look, I'm getting real depressed here.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:05.160]   We have all these stories about bad guys being taken down and about currencies that may or
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160]   may not be compromised.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.880]   We've got stories about people being hacked.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.960]   I just want one story that's not about somebody who doesn't deserve it somehow getting ahead.
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.400]   I want a merit-based story.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   What do you got?
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.400]   I got this.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.400]   I got this.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.560]   How about this?
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.840]   If you're one of these people who are wonderful enough to own a Tesla, you're probably going
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.560]   to die in a fire.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:37.520]   That's what's funny is that stock is a story I thought I was setting you up with.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.520]   This is where I went.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.680]   I have two friends that own Teslas.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.360]   Please amplify the level of detail on this.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:50.200]   Okay, so we had a story from last week about this mysterious Tesla that caught fire and
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.800]   of course the stock dropped immediately and people were saying, "Oh my God, we told you.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.320]   This was going to be horrible."
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:01.120]   As it turns out, this was a single accident where some driver drove over something and
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.680]   ripped the heck out of the bottom of his car.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.600]   The car caught on fire.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.000]   Everyone took pictures of it and now it's the Tesla Roadster is a death trap.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   This is one of the things I want to bring this up because I do believe this is the lighter
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.480]   side of tech because is this not fun in all its glory?
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.000]   This is, "Oh my God, we were right about the electric car."
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.280]   Whereas how many times do we see gas cars burst into flames?
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.200]   How many times do we see accidents destroy cars?
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:35.000]   But because it's the Tesla, it almost makes me feel that if there was ever, ever an accident
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.320]   with a Tesla Roadster, people would just assume that it's going to kill you.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.520]   This is Dungeons and Dragons all over again.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:48.000]   The first time anyone saw Dungeons and Dragons and then talking about Wizard and Conjuring
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.520]   Devils or whatever, we're always scared of what's new.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:55.840]   The first concrete example of something we have bad associated with it, we make sure
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.120]   to blow up, congratulations Tesla.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.720]   You're now as awesome as Dungeons and Dragons.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:08.440]   It's interesting to read this because something I didn't realize about the Model S.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.960]   Earlier this week, Model S traveling at highway speed struck a large metal object, apparently
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:15.160]   a piece of a tractor trailer that had fallen off.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:18.680]   The geometry of the object caused a powerful lever action as it went under the car punching
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:23.800]   upward and impaling the Model S with a peak force on the order of 25 tons.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:27.280]   Only a force of this magnitude would be strong enough to punch a three inch diameter hole
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.280]   through the quarter inch armor plate protecting the base of the vehicle.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.080]   I knew there was stuff protecting the batteries and there's a lot of batteries in a Tesla
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.080]   S.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.440]   Quarter inch plate, that's huge.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:47.480]   It's twice the sickness of the typical safe use to store things in a home in the United
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.480]   States.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.360]   That's an incredible amount of steel to wrap around the batteries.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.040]   That's also an incredible amount of force to act on that steel.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:00.800]   That's the weird part, which is so many news agencies that ran with this story last week.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:05.000]   They were making it out as if, "Oh, well, they just hit something on the road, a broom,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   bucket."
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.160]   And they said, "No, this was a chart of steel."
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.840]   This was a tank killing chart of steel that got pivoted under the car and ripped into
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.840]   the battery pack.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.520]   And yeah, in that instance, that battery pack is going to catch fire.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.480]   But I think...
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:27.160]   And while we're on this subject, Padre, what do you think of the fact that Elon Musk personally
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.000]   responds to all of these things?
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.720]   Earlier we saw Elon Musk respond to a bad review that somebody gave of the Model S saying
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.600]   that it died, mid-travel, and of course he dissected the data to go back and essentially
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.320]   call the guy a liar.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:46.240]   And the fact that Elon is personally responding to, with explanations over Twitter and of
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.360]   course press releases, explaining exactly what happened and pointing out quite correctly
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:57.880]   that he said, "Look, if we're going to compare apples to apples, forget the number, I'm probably
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   wrong here."
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.720]   But he said that gas cars are 20 times more likely to explode in a collision or whatever.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   Right?
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.440]   Well, here's the thing.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.880]   There are those who are saying, "Wait a minute, Elon Musk is he's acting like the irresponsible
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:11.880]   CEO."
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:12.880]   Five times more likely.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   Right.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   So they say, "Oh, he should just shut up.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.120]   He should let us PR people handle this.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:20.680]   It's not the job of the CEO to go out there and jump on every negative story about his
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:21.880]   product."
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.880]   But...
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.560]   And I'm only going to speak for myself right now because previously I had been speaking
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.760]   for the entire Catholic Church, but now it's just...
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   It's just me.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:32.600]   But I love seeing this kind of engagement.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.200]   He is obviously a geek.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.560]   He is obviously passionate about this.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:39.600]   And so I like it when he actually mixes it up with people and says, "Wait a minute, wait
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.600]   a minute.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.600]   Back off for a second.
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.720]   I know it's fun to point fingers, but before you do that, let me give you the real data,
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.720]   either about that review.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:50.920]   Let me show you what the computer said about his battery use or this.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.600]   Let me show you what actually penetrated the car.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.200]   And it's surprisingly refreshing to see a CEO do that.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.200]   That's just me.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.200]   I don't know if anyone shares that.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.200]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.200]   Absolutely.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.200]   I mean, I agree.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.840]   Look, Elon Musk is our real life Tony Stark.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.080]   And I love the fact that we live in a world where he feels appropriate to jump in and
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.360]   call stuff out on that.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.520]   And he's right by the numbers.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.240]   I mean, he gave the numbers.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:22.960]   As he said, over 150,000 car fires per year, one vehicle for every 20 million miles and
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.640]   one fire at over 100...
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.720]   Basically, he lays it out.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:32.960]   It's like his cars buy the numbers and granted the sample size is smaller, is five times safer
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.360]   as far if you're worried about explosions than gas vehicles.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.360]   Patrick, what about you?
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.360]   Is this going to...
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.360]   I keep doing that.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.360]   Not Patrick.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:47.240]   Is this going to put you off from that Tesla Roadster I know you have reserved?
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.240]   Probably not.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:54.040]   If anything, it's probably going to make me more likely to actually go and buy it.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:58.240]   Because I think what you were saying earlier, Brian is very true.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.800]   He's not letting his PR people do the talking.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.880]   And instead, what's happening is that he's talking normal.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:13.720]   He's saying what all of us would like people to say in these situations.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:18.960]   Sometimes it comes off as a little rough, but usually overall, he's just saying what
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:20.520]   everyone thinks.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.240]   And that buys him a lot of sympathy, I think.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.920]   And he is now...
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.920]   I can't remember...
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:31.360]   I can't count how many times he's been compared to Tony Stark, but that's a pretty good place
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360]   to be in.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.880]   So I'm sure he's rubbing some people the wrong way, but overall, I think it's very much
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.480]   in that positive for him.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.240]   I think he's going to be the reverse Tony Stark.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.160]   He's making cars and things that save the world now, and then he's going to start making
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.160]   weapons.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160]   You know?
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.240]   He's going to start up as a green technologist.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.880]   He's going to have such an excellent image that we're going to go like, "Yay, Tesla,
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.920]   weaponry and planes and destroying things."
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:58.920]   And then he makes kindness.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.640]   Then he's going to start womanizing.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.640]   He's going to become a misogynist.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.720]   He's going to start snarkly replying to the public.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.800]   You know, even his weapons are going to be awesome.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.920]   He's going to manage to find a way to build the Death Star or AT&T's or something that's
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.160]   going to make it really cool.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.680]   I have trusted you.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.680]   It's going to be with him.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.560]   But you know, the very first time I ever saw a Tesla dealership, I was walking to the
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.960]   Arch the Triumph in Perry.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.960]   Really?
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.520]   It's a lovely story.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:32.960]   I had never seen the Tesla, but I'd never actually been in a showroom filled with them.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.960]   I loved it.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.320]   I just like laugh because they're all over the place.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:42.320]   In this part of Northern California, I'd see a Tesla probably every other day.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.320]   It's kind of weird because I know it's not like that in most of the US, but it's like
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.320]   they're everywhere.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.320]   Is that strange?
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.720]   I remember the first time I saw a Tesla, I was like, "Oh, whoa, that's the Tesla."
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.320]   And now it's, oh, yeah, there's one.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.320]   There's one.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.320]   Oh, I saw one yesterday.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.880]   There's one parked down the street.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.840]   Sub-Zero 721 in the chat room has it.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.600]   He says, "The Tesla Gundam."
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.600]   There you go.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.240]   That's the kind of thing you want to see.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.240]   Go Elon Musk.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.240]   Tesla have the arms.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.240]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:11.040]   And you know what they do is they'd all have Tesla Gundam's and you'd have like wrestling
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.080]   matches out in the San Francisco Bay.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.920]   And then you'd be able to have a body slam and giant waves going over the place.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.640]   What's your own on the sidelines?
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.360]   I have no problem with that.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.360]   I don't know.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.880]   There's a really, I got to say there's a really interesting article in this in the
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.360]   MIT Technology Review that one of the things they talk about is how the one thing that
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.400]   came out of this that wasn't particularly positive news is it's a reminder of how hard
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.240]   it is to put out lithium-ion battery fire.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.120]   Because apparently they thought they had the fire at the fire fire, they thought they
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.440]   had the fire out and then it lit, it sort of reignited itself again.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.040]   So I think we'll be interesting to see that.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.680]   It's not like gasoline is like super, you know, non-combustible.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.280]   So, well, it's okay.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.800]   So National Fire Protection Association, 17 automobile fires reported every hour, killing
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.120]   average of four people every week.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.480]   Automobile fires are 10% of reported US fires.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.360]   So obviously there's a lot of gas fires catching on fire.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.760]   We could talk about the Crown Victoria having the gas tank behind the axle.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:15.960]   It's been the result of the death or disfigurement of a lot of police officers or state troopers.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:22.520]   The United States, there are flaws with gasoline as a fuel because it does do that thing where
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.680]   it goes fump.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:29.920]   But it's interesting at the idea like, okay, if there is a lot of Tesla's in between the
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.800]   San Francisco Fire Department and the Petaluma Fire Department or the San Rosa Fire Department,
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:39.520]   maybe that means all the fire departments have to put together a better school for putting
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.440]   out lithium-ion battery fires or maybe Elon Musk probably already has a crew of engineers
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.320]   at some isolated place, lighting lithium-ion batteries on fire.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.120]   Not that they have a lot of spare ones to burn, but to figure out the best way to put
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:56.000]   the fire out because if they're saying is if these things heat up and more electrolyte
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.360]   leaks out as a response to the heat and electrolyte reignites, that's problematic, right?
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.000]   No matter how unlikely it is to happen.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.360]   You mentioned the MIT review, which made me instantly think of another awesome story
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.720]   from this week, which was the self-assembling cube robots.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.720]   Did you guys see this?
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:16.720]   The swarm, yes.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.400]   Yeah, I don't know if we're up against a break, but that's definitely something I want to
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:22.840]   talk about.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:28.200]   You know what, Brian, we're going to talk about that right after I take some time to
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.200]   talk about it.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:30.920]   Yeah, I never saw that coming.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:31.920]   I didn't know.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.520]   That's why I was asking if they're happy to bring you.
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.520]   You never know.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.520]   But you might be a mom.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.760]   You've got to thank the people who make this week in tech possible.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.480]   And honestly, I don't know much about this next sponsor.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.680]   They're called what maybe you could help me with this square as spots.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.560]   What is that, Brian?
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:54.000]   If I'm not mistaken, they're actually named in advance for the MIT robots, which are vaguely
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.200]   cube-like square space is a robot that will destroy the world.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.920]   Am I thinking of the right square space?
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:01.920]   I think so.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.720]   I think this episode of this week in tech was actually brought to us in part by square
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:06.720]   space.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.720]   Oh, wait.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.720]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.120]   I thought you said cube bot.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.120]   Oh, okay.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120]   My bad.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.120]   Fantastic.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.160]   All in one platform that allows you to make amazing high quality blogs, portfolios, or
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.160]   any kind of website.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.720]   And you don't need to have any kind of background or skill because their templates look so good.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.520]   Whether you're a CSS wizard or somebody who doesn't know the difference between an H,
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.160]   a D, an M, and an RL, then square space has got you covered.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.960]   If you need an exceptional looking website and you need it right now and you need it
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:38.760]   to look good, whether it's on an iPhone, on an Android, on an iPad, or whether any kind
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:42.880]   of tablet or a desktop computer, they're going to make you look fantastic.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.880]   Yeah, they are.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.520]   And you know, one of the things that I love about squares face is that they allow me to
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.280]   channel my inner Leo.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.080]   And what my inner Leo is telling me about squares spaces that you're going to like them
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:54.080]   because they're always improving their platform.
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.800]   You see, every time we advertise squares space on the Twitter network, they've got new features
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.240]   with new designs, even better support than before, which I didn't think was possible.
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.320]   They've also got beautiful designs.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:09.120]   They have more than 20 new templates for you to start with and all the style options that
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.480]   you need to create a unique website for you or your business.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.680]   Brian knows about this.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.800]   You know, you don't want to buy into one of these packages and find a beautiful website
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:21.120]   that looks just like a thousand other beautiful websites.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.080]   They let you know what I customize.
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:26.920]   I mean, that's the thing is like when I get to a decision gate like this, I ask my inner
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.760]   Leo what I should do.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.120]   Inner Leo, what kind of website should I get?
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:37.920]   A squish, squish, squish, you're in a Leo command too.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:40.000]   You know, there's something wrong with your inner Leo.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.040]   You may need to get that look that.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:48.040]   But my inner Leo reminds me that square spaces actually won several awards, including from
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.200]   the FWA, the Webbies from Forbes.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.200]   Yes, right.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:58.640]   They get awards just like NSFW show one, that big chat realm thing thing thing that weird.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.400]   By the way, one of my favorite stories and it's a true story, formerly of totally rad
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.320]   show, Jeff Kanata had his personal website on Squarespace and he used one of the default
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.960]   templates and was surprised to find himself on the list of 50 website.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:18.240]   Was it designs to be inspired by like he was on a curated list of like, this is an exceptional
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.880]   site and they didn't know that he had just used the default template from Squarespace.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.840]   And you know, one of the other things I like about Squarespace is you don't have to be
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.840]   a programmer.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.480]   It's really that easy to use and they're inexpensive.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:36.320]   In fact, I think they're only about $8 a month, which, you know, puts them right in that realm
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:42.280]   of possibility for even the most novice, the most simple, the most basic user of web services.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.640]   It's incredibly easy to use.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:44.640]   But you know what?
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.600]   If you want some help, Squarespace has a support team that will work with you 24 hours
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:55.160]   a day, seven days a week and that $8 plan I talked about that includes a free domain
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.560]   name if you sign up for a year.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.720]   So basically it's a wash with trying to do it yourself.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:04.560]   Why would you do it yourself if you could get an entire team of experienced professionals
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:05.560]   behind you?
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.560]   You know, you know, mine.
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:10.600]   Here's the best part about Squarespace is they use distributed hosting.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:14.880]   So if your site suddenly becomes super popular or better yet, if somebody tries to like,
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.760]   DDoS you, they're going to find that they just walked into a club made of diamonds.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:23.520]   They're going to be in some kind of diamond club and they won't be able to permeate the
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.520]   walls.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:25.720]   They can't take them down.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.200]   That's the strength of the diamond club.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.360]   And you know what else that diamond club does?
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.600]   It does search engine optimization automatically.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.280]   You may know that that SEO thing.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.280]   It's how you get found on the internet.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.560]   With Squarespace, they advertise for you.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.560]   They ensure that your site's content can be found under the search terms that it needs
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.560]   to be found.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.560]   So if you are, you know, part of that club that's kind of diamondy, you don't have to
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:53.720]   go and pay another service to do your search engine optimization.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.800]   It's built into the package.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.760]   That's the brilliance of our friends over at Squarespace.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.360]   Look, tell me two things.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.960]   All I want to know is how can I try it out for free and how can I give a kick back to
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.720]   our friends here this week in tech?
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.560]   Well, let me tell you that first part.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.040]   The first part is it's even better than free.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:14.080]   You see, they let you start it with no credit card required.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.760]   That's not one of those annoying sites that says, yeah, we'll give you a month free, but
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.960]   first give us all the information about you.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.440]   No, no, that's not Squarespace thing.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.520]   They want you to try the service, see if you like it, see if you're comfortable with it,
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.840]   then if you like it, you go ahead and buy it.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.720]   So when you decide to sign up for Squarespace and this ad should have convinced you to sign
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:40.160]   up for Squarespace, make sure to use our offer code, TWIT10, and you'll get 10% off
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.760]   and you'll show your support to this week in tech.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:47.040]   Now we thank Squarespace for this week in tech, but we also thank them for everything
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.320]   they do for the TWIT TV network, Brian.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.080]   Is there really anything better than Squarespace?
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:01.360]   I was going to say like the birth of my first child, but ehhhhhh, look at it go Squarespace.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.560]   Yeah, I think we have to go Squarespace.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.040]   That's how we do things.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.040]   You went there straight to the children.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.040]   We used to be.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:11.040]   Shaveless.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.040]   Ooh, wait, ooh.
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.040]   Oh, oh.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.040]   Brian, take us away from that.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.960]   Well, what's this thing about the swarm bots?
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:20.760]   Okay, alright, so MIT made this, they made these individual cubes.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:23.960]   Each one is about the size of a child's building block.
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.800]   You picture the ABC blocks that you have in your hand.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:31.720]   And inside, they figured out that most robots are built for stability, they're built for
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:36.320]   mobility with legs or some kind of treads or whatever, and that to run those things
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.000]   you require all kinds of gears.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.280]   They built these little bots that are, they're self-organizing, they're autonomous, and they
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:50.520]   move purely by a little flywheel inside that spins up to 20,000 RPM.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:54.600]   And then by doing it, they realized they could spin it real fast and then stop it, and the
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:59.160]   block would jump forward and they discovered this quite by accident, but then they realized
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.320]   that putting magnets on the outside of it would allow them to essentially create, you
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.200]   know, when you watch Transformers and you see, you know, basically a boombox melt into
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.280]   all of a sudden a 20 foot tall robot or whatever, and you're like, nothing can move that way
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:18.440]   or you watch the T1000 melt into liquid metal and you're like, nothing can move that way.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.480]   Essentially, they've created a framework that really can do that.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:29.240]   These cubes self-organized, they look like Tetris pieces right now, but in fact, we just
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.880]   talked about this on the, the Weird Things podcast.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.080]   It is astonishing to watch these things in action.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:37.120]   I know Chad's going to bring it up on screen right now.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.360]   Jump to about, yeah, about two thirds of the way in right now, and you'll be, there
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.360]   you go, right about there.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:47.480]   You'll be able to see these things moving around, and for the first time, you can see
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.440]   how these things could essentially do the stuff that we've only seen in science fiction
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:53.440]   until now.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.800]   Okay, am I the only one terrified by these spinning blocks of death?
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.760]   Is that just me?
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.760]   Is that just me?
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:03.520]   Because I'm looking at that thinking that this is how I'm going to die.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.400]   No, okay, here's how you're going to live because what'll happen is eventually you'll
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:11.560]   just decide to download your brain into one of these things and then we'll all be awesome
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.040]   and gray goo overlords.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.840]   I'd rather die.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:19.400]   I'd rather die and trust my intelligence to whatever comes next.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.200]   I do not want to be trapped in a spinning box.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:27.440]   Actually, I feel like I am trapped in a spinning box, so it would be that much of a difference.
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.880]   I always love, I love stories like this because, you know, especially when you've got students
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:36.640]   who are, who are just messing around, they've come up with these concepts that someone is
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:40.960]   going to use this, this idea of a self-assembling robot of robots that can create structures
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:45.440]   with very simple mechanisms, this is going to make its way into some product that eventually
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.760]   will click and someone will say, "Oh, that's right.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.360]   Why didn't we think of that before?"
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:52.800]   Yeah, it's really astonishing.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:53.800]   And maybe not.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.600]   Yeah, maybe not.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.600]   It is astonishing.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.640]   It is definitely something that is super interesting.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.760]   I mean, to look at it, they look alive.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.360]   And I guess that's what makes it especially enticing for us.
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.320]   It's technology that really looks, it's not a robot, it's just a box, but it does look
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.120]   somewhat alive.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:22.080]   There's a really, really, really, really, really, really long way from this to something actually
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.080]   useful though.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:26.280]   This is fundamental research almost.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:31.600]   And it could be, I'm playing devil's advocate here, sorry, but it could be that this just
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.880]   remains jumping boxes and it turns into a children's toy and nothing more.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:43.520]   I don't really see how these boxes could become something.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:47.960]   You would need to have mechanisms and for them to do something else, they would need
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:53.600]   to have a lot more on board or to assemble into different geometric forms that could
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:57.160]   move in unison.
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:02.640]   It's very, very early on and I don't want to need the grout here, but I could see this
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.160]   become awesome.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.080]   I could also see this become just, you know, nothing.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.080]   You know what, Brian?
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.320]   I now agree with not Patrick.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.080]   This story is bad and you should feel bad.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:19.600]   I'll tell you what, you say that, I'm going to send my army of a hundred thousand cubed
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.960]   bots to absorb you.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:27.320]   Okay, let's move on to something else that I think is awesome that it's probably also
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:30.560]   going to be shot down by our steam to not Patrick.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:33.640]   And that is, guess what they're selling at Ikea now?
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:34.640]   Solar battles.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.640]   Wait, cubots?
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:39.680]   Well, yes, so cubots that put themselves into solar panels.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.400]   Now this is only happening across the pond.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.080]   It's in 17 British stores.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:49.080]   They're talking about a couple of Chinese made systems that will sell for roughly $9,200.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:54.160]   The idea is now that you can walk into Ikea and in the same aisle that you buy your USC,
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.000]   which is some sort of desk, you get to buy a system that will go up on the roof and provide
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.600]   at least partial power to your house.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:06.280]   Now, this is something that people predicted about solar in the United States so long ago
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.240]   that you would be able to buy and walk into a best buy and buy something that will help
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:16.440]   to remove yourself from the grid, but it never materialized for any number of reasons, including
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.400]   a lot of regulation.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.280]   Why is this now possible in British stores?
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.000]   I mean, to be honest, there's only one thing I care about.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.400]   Like do they actually do anything?
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:31.800]   Are you spending $100 so you can save $9.35 on your overall electric bill?
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:45.520]   This is conspicuous consumerism and obviously, first of all, they're talking about with
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.440]   the what's available in terms of purchasing subsidies in the UK.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.600]   You're talking about a seven year payoff on a product that should have a 30 year lifespan.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.600]   Right.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.640]   You said subsidies though, right?
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.320]   Well, okay, even if it's not, even if it's full $9,000, I think it takes it up to 10
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.520]   year payoff for a product with a 30 year lifespan.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.080]   It's like on one hand, I get what you're saying like, oh God, just we need somebody else spending
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:13.080]   $100,000 on electric car to prove how green they are because they're using cold generated
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:19.920]   electricity in their giant lithium ion packed vehicle to move without fossil fuels through
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:20.920]   the highways.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.680]   Yes, that's exactly what I'm afraid about.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.680]   Don't give me.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.520]   I'm assuming I live in Northern California.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.880]   I drive a 7,000 pound three quarter ton diesel truck, but I'm running biodiesel, which is
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:35.960]   actually domestically produced from recycled frickin' Frito Lay potato chip oil, which
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.880]   means I have a lower footprint in terms of actual carbon energy consumption than a frickin'
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:44.440]   Prius because my fuel has pulled the carbon out of the air recently.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.400]   Take that back off, lady.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.600]   Just I'm gonna go hug a tree.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:51.840]   I'm doing it in my own way and my way is in the Prius, my way can pull an air stream.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.080]   Now that I've had my Northern California rant out of the way, I do believe in solar cells.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.760]   I do believe in solar energy.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.920]   I do believe in the million roof initiative here in California because the idea anytime
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:07.200]   you take digging stuff out of the ground to produce energy, you've done something positive.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.560]   It may take a while to pay off.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.880]   You should do the math.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:13.800]   You should investigate the company that's offering to do this, but I like the idea of
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.920]   actually self-containing energy inside of a home.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.600]   This is a good thing, Brian.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.320]   Don't be all negative about it.
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.320]   Please.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:23.320]   Here's what I'm saying is there's the gap right there.
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.320]   There's what you pay up front.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.720]   There's the environmental cost of the manufacturer of the product.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.640]   It's easy to look at this kind of story and just say, "This thing be good.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.640]   Why is America bad?"
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:34.640]   Because it's Ikea.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.640]   How can Ikea?
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.520]   Ikea is just warm and fuzzy.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.720]   It's not like they create a lot of furniture that's up in landfills.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:46.280]   No, no, no, why Ikea is bad is because you need a goddamn pirate treasure map to find your
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.280]   way out of the goddamn place.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   I don't know.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.280]   Not okay.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:53.320]   The problem is I feel like we're in therapy group.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:54.320]   It's all approach.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.080]   Brian, with positive energy, bring Brian love.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:01.520]   Brian, your issue really isn't with Ikea or conspicuous consumerism.
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.640]   It's the fact that you want to buy some obscure bizarrely named thing and you can't find it
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.320]   in the big giant ass store.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.800]   Is that right, Brian?
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.800]   Look, I think we've had a breakthrough here.
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.400]   I think what is interesting though is the idea that if it wasn't, you can kind of do
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:22.480]   a version of this with Costco in the United States where they have a partnership with
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:27.760]   a solar cell supplier and you spend 12 grand and you get a box full of solar panels and
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.600]   inverters and you can put that on the top of your house or better yet.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.280]   Have an electrician with a clue, put it on top of your house.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.680]   I think the only reason this is news is because it's Ikea.
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:40.160]   It means it's probably, what is its name?
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:42.480]   I mean, did they talk about its goofy, sweetest name?
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:43.480]   A juice?
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.480]   A juice?
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.480]   It should be called a juice box.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:47.480]   A pure layer.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:52.840]   There's like a slash through the O and CO layer and there's an oom out over the A.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.080]   I made all of that up.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:55.080]   You can have that Ikea.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:56.920]   No, but I think that's the idea.
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:03.840]   The idea is if it's made it into Ikea, then yes, it is consumer consumable.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.920]   But I think that's a good thing.
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:06.920]   I'm with Patrick here.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:10.400]   If you're bringing it into the realm of the consumer, of the person who's just making
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:13.200]   that buy because they think it's going to make their house better, it means it's no
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.320]   longer up in the stratosphere where only those who are either really rich or just
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.920]   really want to show off the solar system on top of their house can buy into this.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.560]   Now, someone who says, "Wait a minute.
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.120]   Okay, let me do the math here.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.280]   Ten years, three years, whatever it's going to be."
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:28.040]   After that, I get free power.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.040]   I like that idea.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.760]   I mean, how can you not like that?
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:36.480]   Well, mainly because we oftentimes, and keep in mind, this is a long running thing.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.800]   We're looking at 15 years now that we've had subsidies propping up the solar industry.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.120]   And keep in mind, I would love it.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:47.280]   Nothing would make me happier than for solar to say, "Screw you.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.320]   We don't need the subsidies anymore."
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:53.920]   For every dollar you spend on a solar panel, you get $2 worth of energy out of it.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920]   That's where we want to be.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.640]   We all agree on that.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:03.720]   But it's difficult and it's very easy to come up with excuses with why solar isn't here.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.840]   And the real reason is, it's because it's hard.
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.400]   It's hard to come up with something that's energy efficient, that's clean to create for
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.120]   the environment that people can buy affordably.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.880]   And if we could, somebody would just make it overnight and then we would all buy it.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:19.760]   And of course, there's a messy process as we get here.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:25.560]   And when I read a story like this that says, "How come Europe can have magic solar panels
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:27.160]   that make everything rainbows?"
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.520]   And we can't.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:34.640]   It's very easy to say, because big oil and something about Dick Cheney, I hate that argument.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.640]   It's a false dichotomy.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:36.640]   But it's idiotic.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.640]   Okay, okay, okay.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.640]   Right, right.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.080]   Wait a second.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.640]   Did anyone say because big oil and Dick Cheney, I think the story is just, "Hey, there
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:47.880]   are solar panels at IKEA."
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.040]   That's kind of cool.
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:50.680]   No, that's just it, Patrick.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:53.840]   If that was the story, then I would be thrilled.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:59.840]   But you'll notice the headline reads, "There's solar panels at IKEA in Europe.
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.280]   What's stopping them from coming to America?"
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.520]   It's like, "Dude, I hate that stuff."
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.080]   Because we already have a lot of ops, because we can buy them at Costco for less money.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.080]   Okay, wait, hold on.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.120]   Let me be in the voice of neutrality here and not, Patrick.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.640]   I'm going to ask you this question.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:18.320]   That is, it's clear to me that, so Patrick wants to save the planet and Brian wants to
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.320]   destroy the planet.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.640]   Where do you fall in between that?
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:26.640]   Well, I'm married to a Swedish fin.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.640]   So I think I'm contracted the obliged to cite with whatever IKEA is doing.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.640]   Was that part of the vows?
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.920]   I think so.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.160]   As we recited them, I think it was somewhere in there.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:44.040]   I vowed to obey, to love, and to buy solar.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.040]   Or sooner.
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:49.760]   The Nokia thing was already hitting us pretty hard in my couple.
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.200]   So I really think I shouldn't say anything bad about IKEA.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.400]   Save America, change the subject.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:04.160]   I mean, honestly, I think IKEA, the fact that it's arriving at IKEA, it's obviously a test.
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:09.640]   I don't think it has anything to do with big oil or with Dick Cheney's evil plans to ruin
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.640]   the planet.
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.880]   It's just that they're testing it in that market first, as many companies often do.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:21.520]   And if it's super successful, I'm fairly sure they're going to bring it over to other
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:22.520]   places.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:23.520]   You know why?
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:24.520]   Because they like money.
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.480]   And if they sell, they're going to sell it to other people.
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.200]   So I don't think there's anything nefarious there.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:35.240]   And I didn't read the article, but if they're saying there's something nefarious, they're
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.680]   probably misguided.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:43.760]   And I don't think either that these panels are magically becoming better because they're
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:44.760]   at IKEA.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:48.560]   It's just that they're a little bit more readily accessible.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:51.200]   And that's probably a good thing for those who want to use them.
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:53.800]   I like one of the comments of the chairman.
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:56.360]   There are rice soda pops in Chinese McDonald's.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:57.360]   US must wait.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.360]   I mean, Brian got totally.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.320]   Brian, Schwig got totally scammed on a title.
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:07.600]   You got sucked in on a title because it's like the second paragraph, this article is
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:11.160]   so benign, but it might be well longer before their American counterparts will be able to
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.160]   do the same.
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160]   It's embarrassing.
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.080]   I think the LA Times trolled Brian.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:16.080]   I think that's what happened.
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.080]   It is not.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.080]   It's hard.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:22.320]   Brian, all you got to do is imply that someone thinks they're better than someone else.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.320]   Like what?
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:30.000]   You know, I just I'd like to say as before we move on, that you three being married with
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.280]   kids and me being celibate, I'm more carbon neutral than any of you.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:37.000]   I'm like, okay, like, like, like we're married to each other.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.240]   I could drive a suburban around the city throwing coal out the window and I'd still be
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:42.240]   more carbon neutral.
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.280]   But if you just burn the carb, that would pretty much fix it.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.720]   Now right after the break, we are going to come back and I'm going to wind up Brian once
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:54.840]   more because I have one more story that I'm sure is going to just do just just like that.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:55.840]   Just like that.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.480]   Brian, could you what's what's that?
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.140]   I think it's like I didn't even know what you're up to, but you know how to get my
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:02.920]   goat and I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:03.920]   Screw that.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:04.920]   Okay.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:10.000]   While Brian is taking care of his solar problem, I want to take some time to talk about go
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.680]   to meeting because they are a supporter of this week in tech.
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:17.680]   Now if you've watched any of my shows, you know that I love go to meeting because we
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:20.280]   all understand that we need to meet.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.160]   We need to talk to our colleagues, to our coworkers, to our customers.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:28.720]   We need to have that face to face eye to eye contact in order to get things done.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.760]   But when you work in different offices in different cities and different countries, sometimes
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.120]   it's just difficult to get that face to face time, which is why we love go to meeting with
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.120]   HD faces.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:44.800]   It's the incredibly easy way to meet online and see each other in HD.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.080]   Now you see with go to meeting, you can share screens.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:51.560]   It makes it easier for your team to be on the same page.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:56.160]   And if you turn on your webcam, it makes it that simple for your meeting to become an
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.600]   HD video conference.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.760]   And imagine the kind of data that you get when you can actually see the person that you're
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:02.760]   talking to.
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.920]   It's not just a voice coming over a speaker.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:09.280]   It's not a disembodied stream of words coming at you.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.520]   You can see that small frown or that raised eyebrow or that slightly quizzical look on
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:20.880]   someone's face that tells them, you don't understand or I don't understand you and therefore
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.040]   you need to continue.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:24.040]   That's what you get with go to meeting.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.120]   You get that extra dimension of communication.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.360]   One of the things I love about go to meeting is that it works from anywhere.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.720]   I've used it on my laptop.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.000]   I've used it on my desktop.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.520]   I've used it on my phone.
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:39.080]   They make it easy for me to meet and share from anywhere, even from my iPad.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:45.280]   You can present from your iPad how much coolness is that to be that mobile and that connected
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:46.520]   at the same time.
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.920]   I love go to meeting and you know I mean it because I'm not just an endorser of the product.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.720]   I use it on a daily basis.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:56.960]   I use this product to talk with the dozens of people that I need to talk to in my real
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.840]   job around the country, around the world.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:03.360]   I use go to meeting and I love it and I know that you will too.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.240]   So here's what I want you to do.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:07.520]   I want you to try go to meeting.
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:11.560]   I want to see if you're going to find it to be as valuable as I do.

[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:29.680]   in tech.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:34.160]   Guys, I want to bring it home with one more story here.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.480]   Praise yourselves.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.480]   And I know.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.120]   And Brian's totally going to love this.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:45.280]   I mean I know he's right on board with the fact that the FAA panel has suggested that
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:50.360]   they sort of relax the standards on turning off devices on airplanes because you know
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.160]   I know Brian was a big proponent of having those devices off in the first place because
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:57.720]   he believes it's the government's place to make sure that we're all safe.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:02.160]   So that cell phone which could potentially down your 747 on its approach.
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:04.240]   Well it you know it was right that it was off.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.040]   Brian I mean you're you're lamenting this decision right?
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:08.040]   I mean you're just.
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.600]   I just want to cry.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:12.320]   This is the best news I've heard in my life.
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:13.920]   Well what does this happen?
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:17.320]   They said they say you could keep your devices on during take off and land.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.320]   No.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:23.640]   Why the FAA received the report and recommendations today on the expanded use of personal electronic
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:24.640]   devices.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.680]   FAA spoke to us or toward Mashable and mail on Monday.
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:31.040]   The administrator will review the report and determine next steps.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:32.040]   Right.
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:36.320]   So essentially they've said you know what maybe we were a bit too strict.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.560]   We should look at the policies again.
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.560]   So there's no there's no recommendation saying hey you know what if they want to start up
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:44.320]   a fax machine in the middle of take off go ahead.
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:48.240]   At least this is a step in the right direction.
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:49.240]   Yes.
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:50.240]   Audre S.J.
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:56.440]   Let this be the day that goes down in history is the only day that a priest gave me false
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:57.440]   hope.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.440]   Well.
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:51:59.440]   Only day.
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:00.440]   Wow.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:01.440]   The hope is there.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.440]   It's pretty good average.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.440]   Here's the thing though.
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.440]   Okay go ahead.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.000]   Oh the the report does not recommend changing rules restricting activities that require a
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.200]   network connection such as voice calls or data transfer.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.520]   Those will likely remain off limits as rules for cell phone use on planes have been governed
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:21.280]   by the FCC since 1991.
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:25.080]   The advisory committee did suggest the FAA should work with the FCC to regress or assuming
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:27.560]   reassess those restrictions as well.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:29.880]   The Wall Street Journal reported.
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:35.280]   I I like to read this story in concert with I believe it was three or four months ago.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:41.240]   There was a researcher who showed that he could overpower the the navigation computer inside
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:46.760]   of a computer if inside of a plane if he had a transmitter in first class that was aimed
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:50.760]   towards that computer with enough power he could actually send it false signals and take
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:52.160]   the plane off course.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:55.520]   Now I think we would all notice that someone had a big old satellite dish looking thing
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.480]   pointed towards the cockpit.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:02.200]   But you know what the FAA is essentially saying is look unless it's unless unless you're that
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.200]   guy.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:07.400]   Yeah the device you bring on the plane it's got no ability to cause any sort of crash or
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.360]   incident or accident.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.840]   Well yes and no they're saying it should remain in airplane mode.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:18.400]   You're not supposed to be using you know your your network data transmitting parts of your
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.400]   device.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:24.160]   But how many of us how many of us have accidentally left the phone on while getting off.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:25.720]   It's up in the overhead bin.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:26.720]   Okay.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:27.720]   No that's a good point.
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:35.800]   Like can I say that this story and this continuing story over the past two or three
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:40.240]   years now I'm going to be the European guy.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:48.520]   I mean this is a very I'm not going to say American this is a very American centric.
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:55.440]   I understand this is this is an important topic and it needs to be discussed and yes
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:00.600]   I want to be using my iPad for the ten minutes and take off and landing that I can't use
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.600]   it.
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:08.040]   Come on the proportion of coverage that this issue using air quotes has been getting on
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.400]   text shows is ridiculous.
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:16.080]   Yes mention it here and there but is it that big an issue in your lives that you that we
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.640]   need to discuss it every.
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:22.760]   Ah I mean come on do how often do you fly.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:29.240]   Patrick yeah do you realize not Patrick that the only reason I still subscribe to Wired
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:35.360]   magazine is because it's the only magazine that that I can read during that ten minutes
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:40.560]   of take off and landing and let me tell you for the record I do not approve of people
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:46.600]   leaving their iPads on inside their backpacks underneath the seat in front of them on 3D
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:53.040]   G networks I do not approve of people who leave their iPhones on in their pockets and
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.960]   then only put on one earbud as they pretend to be asleep so they could continue listening
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:02.680]   to their audio book during take off and landing that's not okay because it's against the
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:09.080]   law and we should no longer have to stand for that illegal behavior.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:12.920]   So decriminalize schwood.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:20.360]   I will see this this just confirms what I always knew about you Brian you I mean you
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:23.080]   are a big proponent of the nanny state.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:28.720]   Oh I like I like chicks who dress up as nannies that's kind of hot.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:30.560]   That's really an overshare Brian.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.480]   Yeah really is an overshare.
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:36.240]   Let me find another story really quickly because.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.960]   Oh word.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:43.320]   Alright alright here's here's one story it's actually semi serious let's take it back take
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.320]   it down a notch.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:49.320]   We've had our fun with exploding cars and death rays on planes.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:51.360]   You know Twitter is going IPO right.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:57.240]   And so as Twitter goes IPO there are some obvious comparisons between it and Facebook.
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.600]   One of the interesting things that just came out this last week is the CEO of Twitter saying
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:06.240]   and I quote we are we are the anti Facebook and he points out several several reasons
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:10.920]   why Twitter is not going to be like the Facebook IPO because they're already focused on mobile
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:15.440]   because they have a strategy for making money because they're not going to do that weird
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:18.520]   thing that Facebook did with their PR agency.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:24.240]   You know they have a clear idea of where they want the company to be with this IPO money
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:29.320]   versus what they say was Facebook's problem of just feeling that they needed to go IPO
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.280]   without actually knowing what they were going to do with that cash.
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.640]   I bring this up at the end of the show because you know I don't like all the speculation
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:40.360]   we know Facebook I mean we know that Twitter is going to go IPO we know that they're going
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:41.760]   to make a ton of cash.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:47.120]   I just want to open up to the panel and say if they open at their target price which I
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.560]   actually can't call up right now let's call it 20 bucks.
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.360]   They open at 20 bucks.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:54.320]   Is this a stock that you would actually invest your hard earned cash in?
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:56.920]   Do you see enough of a business model there?
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:01.880]   Regardless of how important you think Twitter is do you see it making money enough to justify
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:02.880]   an investment?
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:05.440]   I don't buy a stick to that.
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.240]   I don't buy a cat stock.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:13.120]   Hypothetically if we weren't in the tech industry and we couldn't get sued by the SEC for
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:17.760]   typing up stocks that we were going to buy would you buy?
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.000]   Is that answering that question?
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.280]   Isn't that the reason why we could you know get in trouble?
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:31.720]   I mean I'm not a journalist so I could answer it but I don't know I mean I look at the lower
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:33.640]   thirds on this show.
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:36.800]   We have the website name for most of us right?
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:44.000]   We have the website name and the Twitter handle and that's something that ultimately everyone
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.040]   keeps coming back to Twitter all the time.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.360]   I say everyone.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:55.440]   The people who are interested in these sorts of things and Twitter has what is it 200-250
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:02.600]   million users a chunk of those might be fake users that's you know to be expected but I
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:09.320]   have a hard time imagining that a mode of communication that has that many users that
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:21.320]   is so ubiquitous now in every aspect of the media on TV and everywhere you see hashtags
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:27.480]   I have a hard time thinking that this thing is not going to end up making money at some
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:33.840]   point it's already making money but it's not going to end up going up and it is already
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:38.320]   seeing nice trends in every metric.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:42.560]   It's not Facebook and some people are failing it you know are saying that this is a bad
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:49.320]   thing because it doesn't have the Facebook numbers Facebook numbers are unbelievable
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:57.000]   you know 1.26 million users that is not something that you compare your service to because that
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.940]   doesn't it's unreal.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:58:59.940]   But you can't.
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:03.320]   50 million users is not something just got that so.
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:10.000]   But you can compare the fact that when Twitter had its IPO it was profitable and more importantly
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:17.400]   it had figured out how to crack how to sell to its audience Twitter I'm sorry Facebook
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.840]   has figured out how to sell and make money.
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:25.320]   Twitter has never done that Twitter has and it has a big problem for example that article
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:31.600]   that you put it in the doc pod right but the Twitter's fire hose problem the fact that
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:35.760]   the more people join Twitter and the more people you follow the less valuable Twitter
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:42.240]   becomes and the harder it is to sell targeted ads is a real problem and the fact that last
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:47.320]   quarter they lost what was it like I forget what the number is but they lost money these
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:49.960]   are big problems going into an IPO.
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:53.160]   Yeah yeah last word on Twitter.
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:55.480]   Well kind of dealt with it.
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:58.960]   I don't know I always thought the whole anti-f- and maybe I had just haven't read the right
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:04.480]   article but to me it seemed like the anti-Facebook was Twitter trying to say you know if you buy
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:12.480]   it 38 it's not going to drop 20% before rising 88% like eight months later it's it's you know
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:17.280]   it's business big it's it yeah it's Wall Street it's Wall Street to read the game man.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:22.320]   But you know what's not Wall Street Tom Merritt with his look at the week ahead.
