[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.560]   Stand back, this is a panel on fire today.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.240]   Especially you, Christina Warren.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.600]   You are ready to go.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.360]   Senior writer Gizmodo, one of our favorite people in the world, film girl on the Twitter.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.520]   Nice to see you, Christina.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520]   Great to be here.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   Anything new in your life?
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.320]   You know what, just same old same old, I think.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   Okay.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.160]   If anything comes to you, let me know.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   I will.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.600]   Also here, from the register.co.uk.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.120]   Love him, Ian Thompson.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.040]   This is like three of my favorite people on this panel.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.880]   I just love this is going to be so much fun.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.320]   Well, how many tweets about it today?
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.640]   And one of your retweets are just like, "All Star Panel."
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.640]   All stars.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.640]   All star panel.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.560]   That's always better to see that than, "Oh my God, I know I can skip this week."
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.200]   And from Fast Company, Harry McCracken is here.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.280]   Yeah, there's a contingent that says, "Divorek on, okay, I'm going to skip it."
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.600]   But the rest of you, here we go.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   What a good show.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.440]   And what a weird week in the news.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.480]   I don't even know where to start, but I'm going to start with Tuesday and Apple.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.680]   A really interesting thing.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.240]   I think unprecedented.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.560]   Apple brought in five bloggers, not five, no Walt Mossberg, no Wall Street Journal, no
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.280]   New York Times, no Gizmodo.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   They brought in John Gruber from Daring Fireball, arguably one of the most popular Apple blogs.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   They brought in Ena Freed from her new places, Axios.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.680]   She's a very good tech writer.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   From Mashable, Lance Ulinoff, your former boss, Christina, John Pachkowski.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   He was at reco.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   He was not BuzzFeed.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   He was not BuzzFeed.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   He was not BuzzFeed.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   Yep.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.080]   And from TechCrunch, Matthew Panzerino.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.000]   So that's basically five blogs.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.480]   I mean, well known big blogs.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.880]   I was going to say, I mean, you have a world on earth.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.360]   I don't think the distinction at this point between blog and traditional stuff matters
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.760]   as much as it once did.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.400]   But until very recently, it would have been the Wall Street Journal in there.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.560]   It would have been one of the New York Times USA today.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   It wasn't.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   Right.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.160]   And what was really, they brought them all to the design lab.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.880]   They had stuff covered with black cloth.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.560]   So I'm sure I could just see Ena going, we're going to see something today.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   No.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.360]   In fact, right out of the bet, Phil Schiller is there, senior vice president of worldwide
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.280]   marketing, Craig Federighi, he's in charge of software engineering, and John Turnus,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.480]   who's vice president of hardware engineering.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.240]   So you got some, you know, no Tim Cook, but you've got the people and no Johnny I, but
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.080]   you got the people in charge of it.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.200]   And by the way, all these pictures are not from the journalists, but from Apple.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.320]   They do not allow the journalists to take pictures.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.680]   We also don't know as what ground worlds there were.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.200]   Were there, were there, for instance, some off the record things we do have.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   Come on.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.360]   They were preaching to the converted on this one.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.520]   I mean, with the exception of Ena, there's a lot of camp follower stuff around there.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.440]   Well, certainly Gruber, you know, but Matthew Panzerino is pretty independent, I think.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.800]   I haven't seen that many.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   That's how that's.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.960]   Cowsky is definitely independent.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.520]   I haven't seen that many daring, viable stuff, which really lays into Apple in the way that
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   sometimes it deserves.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.160]   No, I probably overstated it on Tuesday.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.000]   I said he was the Fox News of Cupertino.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   That's, that's me.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   That's, yeah.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.440]   But he's, and he's not quite a house or more attention to facts.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.240]   He's more of a fan, but he's a good journalist.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   And he's very accurate.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   He's always accurate.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.080]   He's always been a fan, but he will call it like it is when there's a problem.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.400]   He will be the, he will be the, he will be the, the, the problem.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.320]   Which is probably why they chose him because he's, and I would say up the five, he's been
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.760]   the most outwardly critical of the professional Mac strategy.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.920]   Well, get ready because that's what this was about.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.200]   And the unprecedented part besides, well, it's all unprecedented was the very first thing
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.000]   they say is we blew it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.400]   The trash can Mac, the Mac Pro, the one, you know, that lots of people, including myself
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.240]   twenty thirteen, three thousand dollars, three years ago, never updated.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.840]   The, the, the quote update that they announced was, well, we're just going to make the high
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.560]   end version low end version.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   No, no.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.240]   We're in effect cutting a thousand dollars off the high end version.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.800]   They said we blow it.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.840]   It wasn't designed in a way that we can upgrade it.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.400]   Now, of course, Phil Schiller starts with, oh, the Mac is doing really well.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.160]   We're really proud of, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.840]   But really the, the, the, I think the takeaway is when we designed, you know, remember he
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.480]   was the guy who said, can't innovate my ass.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   Look at this.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.640]   Didn't he eat those words over the social media over the, over the following week?
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.120]   I mean, it was just, he was trying, I don't know if we can say this on air, but trying
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.440]   to polish a turd is a very English expression, which is just, actually, there was quite highly
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   polished that particular.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.360]   They put a lot of elbow work into it, but it didn't work, did it, which is why they've
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.880]   now had to say, guys, yeah, sorry, didn't quite work out this time, but trust us, we'll
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   get it right next time.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.320]   And by the way, I'm, this is something new that we've got now from Matthew, the transcript
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   of this.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.520]   So we have the full transcript, which is nice.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.400]   But, but, but I think the most important statement was when we designed the Mac Pro, the trash
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.680]   can Mac, we didn't, we thought that the future was going to have dual graphics cards for
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.040]   instance.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.760]   We didn't, we didn't make it in such a way that we could reasonably upgrade it for pros.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.720]   So we're, they didn't see USB-C coming.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   Is what I took out of that.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.760]   I mean, they didn't explicitly talk about that, but the big thing that I took from that
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   was that when they designed it, they were thinking that the GPU would be the most important
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.360]   part and that Thunderbolt 2 would be the new process, would be the new bus.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.000]   And they didn't foresee that in a matter of, you know, four years or whatever, that the
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.600]   next big IO advancement would be coming through USB-C.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.200]   Which is funny, because Apple was part of the team that developed USB-C.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   Right.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.000]   Certainly somebody on the campus knew all about USB-C.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And for Mac, they seem to love USB-C.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.640]   The Mac team has USB-C everywhere now.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   Anyway.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.800]   But this is a fundamental problem that Apple's got with buses and that it can't decide what
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.320]   connection technology it wants to use for the last couple of years.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.800]   And as a result, we've now got users left with 17 different dongles.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.560]   They've got to carry around in a bag with them just to make them bloody things.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   Great.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.760]   Federighi says this is a quote.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.720]   I think it's fair to say part of why we're talking today is that the Mac Pro, the current
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.360]   vintage we introduced, he doesn't call it the trashcan Mac.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.400]   We want to do something bold and different.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.000]   In retrospect, it didn't well suit some of the people we were trying to reach.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.440]   It's good for some.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.800]   It's an amazingly quiet machine.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   No one cares.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   When that's your piece of stuff.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   It's a beautiful machine.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   No one cares.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   No one cares.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.440]   But it does not address the full range of customers we want to reach with the Mac Pro.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.000]   Turnis says one of the foundations was dual GPU and for certain blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.240]   But the way the system, this is the key.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.960]   The way the system is architected, it just doesn't lend itself to significant reconfiguration
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.440]   for somebody who might want a different combination of GPUs.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.920]   That's when we realized we had to take a step back and completely re-architect what we're
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.960]   doing and build something that enables us to do those quick regular updates, keep it
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.440]   current, keep it state of the art.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.160]   Now, at that point, they said, we are working on a new Mac Pro.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.720]   It will not be available this year.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.680]   They didn't say when it will be available.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.960]   I saw a story repeated by Mac rumors from a blog that said he talked to a number of people
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.080]   and it may not be until 2019.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.760]   The reason he thinks that is his people told him and the Apple people told him that
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.360]   they started working on the new design a few weeks ago.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.480]   It's not unreasonable to say it might take them as long as two years, certainly over
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.240]   a year to make a new year.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.920]   Well, they've dropped the ball on this sector for so long now, they're playing catch up
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.920]   constantly.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.840]   I said because they had the cheese grater Mac was perfect.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.600]   And now Microsoft is eating their lunch with designers.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.120]   I think that, so this is, I'm going to say, in my opinion, by the way, I have the Surface
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   Studio.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.120]   That's what I use.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.480]   And I think a lot of designers would look at this and say, that's what I wanted a Mac
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480]   to be.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.760]   Touch screen, by the way, Apple said at this meeting, no touch screen ever.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.480]   They're not going to get off the whole meals.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.480]   They said at this also we're going to continue to update the iMac.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.080]   There'll be a pro-ish iMac later this year.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.320]   They said pro iMac later this year that we are going to make new Mac mini.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.120]   It's going to be a little taller maybe.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.680]   And they said not this year, but sometime, which makes it to me a vaporware announcement,
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.480]   there will be a new Mac Pro.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.880]   Trust us on this one, it'll be coming.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.400]   It seems to me this is to staunch the bleeding of people.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.600]   They're hoping that pros listening, and I don't know why a pro would do this, would
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.960]   say, "Oh, all right, I guess I won't make the shift to Windows this year and I'll survive
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.080]   till the next Mac Pro comes out."
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.080]   Which some pros might do.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   I mean, if they're work flu, depending on what their software work is, depending on
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.080]   it.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.080]   You have to be very devoted to Macintosh.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.080]   Well, you have both.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.080]   I mean, I get it.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080]   And some people are.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.480]   If you are looking at your budget and you don't have to make a hardware decision right
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.960]   now, if you think that you can make that decision a year from now, or if you think that the
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   new iMac might be able to fill in the gaps, that might be useful.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.760]   I mean, it's basically hoping that the pros who are already kind of eyeing a professional
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.240]   Windows desktops are going to be convinced to not do that because they know that something
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240]   new is coming.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.600]   And whether that works or not, I don't know.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.760]   But I mean, that's obviously what they're hoping is that they'll be able to prevent people
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.520]   from making those decisions.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.440]   Up until the time they made this announcement, it was kind of early reminiscent of almost
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.600]   20 years ago when the Mac was really bottoming out.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.760]   And there are all these intensely loyal Mac users who were trying to decide whether to
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.480]   move to Windows, which seemed to be the only option at that point.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.600]   And some of them did it fairly quickly and a lot held on.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.720]   And eventually the ones who held on actually were rewarded because the Mac came back.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.160]   But you saw this conversation on the web until they made this announcement that maybe they
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:17.320]   will never be another really powerful Mac aimed at creatives and people who want expandability
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.440]   and a lot of horsepower.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.480]   So they just kicked the can down the road a little bit because it's entirely possible
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.200]   that when they do reveal the new Mac probe, people will grumble about that too.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.080]   But I mean, the Mac came back because Steve Jobs came back and he actually had the balls
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.120]   to sit down to do I and others and say, look, this is how it needs to be done.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.240]   He did the famous quadrant.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.120]   He said there's pro and consumer, there's desktop and mobile.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.640]   We're going to make four products, one in each quadrant.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.920]   This is a very different Apple.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.560]   This is not Steve Jobs Apple.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:01.080]   This is for Apple to say, we screwed up with our top of the line product and we're going
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.200]   to have we haven't updated in three years and we're never going to update it.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.480]   This is Thomas Holwerta writing an OS news and I don't know how connected Thomas is.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.240]   He's saying, you don't do you think he's maybe make I don't think he's making it up,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   but he says, I don't think he's making it up.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.960]   I just don't think it's sources are as good as maybe they may be not, but he says and
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.800]   so maybe we'll take with the grain.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:25.120]   We'll take with the grain of salt, you know, 2019, although I will point out if Apple thought
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.720]   it would come out in 2018, they would say 2018.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.240]   All they said was not this year.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.960]   Well, they'd rather pleasantly surprise people than have a
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   Exactly.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.640]   Disappointing or they'd rather keep these people strong along as long as possible.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.160]   He says, what made Apple do a 180?
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.560]   Well, after the this is what his sources tell him after the announcement of the new
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.360]   MacBook Pro with touch bar orders for the refurbished old MacBook Pros supposedly went
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   through the roof.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.560]   And by the way, I did that.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.000]   I had a touch bar hate the touch bar.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Sure.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.360]   Ended up trading it in for the touch bar list the function key lower end model, which I'm
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.000]   in love with, which is a great classic Macintosh laptop.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.520]   He said, and after the initial batch of reviews came out, they shot up even higher the refurbished
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   orders.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:12.560]   This response to the new MacBook Pro with touch bar took Apple completely by surprise.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.360]   Combined with the problems surrounding the LG Ultra fine five k to display.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   Remember, Apple's kind of implied we're not going to make displays anymore.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.920]   We'll let we'll let LG do it.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.240]   But then that LG display broke the Internet because if it was anywhere near your router,
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.920]   it would stop working.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.120]   And the constant negativity from professional Apple users, the company, this is a Thomas
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.400]   again, can decided to double down on professional users as a result will be getting a new Mac
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.760]   Pro and an iMac Pro.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.320]   iMac Pro this year, new Mac Pro not this year.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.800]   And in addition, he says, I don't know if this is true.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.440]   This would be another big retrenchment from Apple.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.320]   They're exploring additional retinomac with Pro models without the touch bar and maybe
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.840]   hooking up an iPad Pro to a Mac to use it like a Cintiq.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   Hmm.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.440]   What you can do now with third party software.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.440]   Do it does that.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   Yes, you can.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.440]   Not very well.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   Astro pad.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.440]   Astro pad.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.200]   Yeah, Astro pad works quite well.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:14.360]   I wonder though, you know, to me when I think about when Apple started to lose some of the
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.320]   Pro market and obviously they still have a lot of it.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.720]   I'm not trying to say that they've lost pros because that's not accurate.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.160]   But when I started to see when there was this shift, when you know it about when they kind
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.200]   of regained things, you know, in the in the late 90s with Steve Jobs coming back, you could
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.880]   also predicate that on the creation of a final cut and logic and kind of this professional
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.000]   software apps they made.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.200]   But when Apple released final cut 10 back in what was it like 2011 at NAB, you know,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.120]   that was a big switch away from how video professionals have been using software and
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.120]   it wasn't a positive one.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.920]   And in fact, the industry reaction was quite negative.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.600]   We made that shift here at Twit.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:58.360]   We replaced all our Mac Pro great cheese graders with Dell workstations and Premiere,
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   Adobe Premiere.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   And you're not alone.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   Many, many places did that.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.040]   Many, many, many shops that I was at NAB both the year that it was announced and I was at
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:11.760]   NAB the subsequent years after it had happened and seeing the shift just, you know, anecdotally
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.840]   amongst, you know, on the floor of seeing places that had gone from being, you know, mostly
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.080]   supporting even hardware, external hardware supporting final cut to being, you know,
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.360]   Premiere based things was extraordinary.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:29.360]   And so I do wonder how much of this is kind of tied together where you, in addition to
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.200]   obviously by their own admission, not making the right sort of professional computer with
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.240]   the trash can Mac Pro and not being extensible and maybe not being future proof in the way
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.600]   that they would have anticipated.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.280]   They over emphasized and thought that GPUs would be important in a way that ultimately
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.800]   it turns out that there was different connectivity standards and different sorts of things that
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   were more important.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   Yeah, I guess mistakes can happen, right?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   I understand.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   Yeah, of course they can't.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   You could screw up that way.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.000]   Look, without a doubt, but I wonder how much of it was kind of a combination of both that
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.120]   design decision and then also the switch in software where you had a fundamental and a
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.040]   hugely, hugely, you know, big change in final cut 10.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.120]   And I think the final cut 10 has come around and I think that if the final cut 10 that
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.840]   is available now had been released six years ago, you wouldn't have seen the switch that
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.800]   happened, but when you did see that big industry shift, which incidentally was the same thing
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.480]   that it happened when the first final cut came out where people switch from evident and
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.840]   premier systems to using final cut when you have that seismic kind of shift within a
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.280]   lot of professionals to being like, well, we're now Adobe people and Adobe has now moved
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.920]   to a software as a service model and Adobe software is going to work the same as PC as
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   it is on Mac.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.120]   I wonder how much that has to do with kind of the feeling amongst professionals that
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.240]   Apple is less relevant, if that makes any sense.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   Because I so I wonder like how much of it is that they'd ignored things on the software
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.320]   side to a certain extent, they'd made wrong bets there in addition to maybe making some
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.400]   wrong calculations when it came to at least on the Mac Pro side, some of the designs consideration.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.880]   Shiller did want to reassure pros about software.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.240]   He says, I want to reiterate our strong commitment there as well, both with final cut pro 10
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.560]   and logic 10.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.640]   There are teams on these software products that are completely dedicated delivering great
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.120]   software, no foot off the gas there.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.560]   But this meeting really is to reassure pros, right Harry?
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.840]   I mean, that's really what this is all about.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.560]   Yeah, they were really having an existential crisis in a lot of cases.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.480]   They had no idea what was going to come.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.480]   Is it enough?
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.880]   Again, I think it's kind of kicking the can down the road.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.760]   Eventually these machines will come out there.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.600]   They're not going to please everybody.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.360]   Will people, how hard is it?
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.600]   I mean, obviously you just mentioned Christina, we've shifted twice.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.280]   How hard is it if you shifted the windows this year to go back to Mac?
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:48.080]   If they come out with a great Mac Pro at the end of 2018, it could shift back, right or
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.080]   wrong?
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.720]   Yeah, well, you still got some transferable skills across the thing.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.120]   Well, that's one thing our editors did not have a hard time.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   I'm going to get out of date.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.960]   They did not have a hard time moving from final cut to Premiere.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.120]   I mean, not that we do the kind of editing that we do here is not really that.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.280]   Pure pain in the derriere way of actually having to go.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.200]   In fact, you have to do that every couple of years.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.560]   I think honestly, once people shift, okay.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.640]   Well, as long as Windows continues to serve that audience, you're not going to shift,
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.600]   even if you see a sexy, hot looking Mac Pro, you're not going to shift.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.760]   Yeah, but one point in Apple's favor is that Windows 10 is such a dog of an operating system
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.760]   at the moment.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   Is it?
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   I'm not a fan.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.760]   Certainly is named at Creator Pro's.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   No.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.760]   Well, guess what?
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.000]   Tuesday, the creator's update comes out.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.120]   Guess why Microsoft named that the creator's update.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.760]   Not that there's anything particularly creative, but it's got 3D paint.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   That's it.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   Woohoo.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.760]   But still, my basic goal.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.240]   But there's no secret that this is, Microsoft sees this as an opportunity.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   That's what we do.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   You don't see the Surface Studio.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.720]   They're building some gorgeous hardware without having Apple.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:56.040]   I mean, I was at the studio launch in New York and Microsoft were very plain.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.040]   It's like, yeah, we're getting into bed with the software developers, so this is supported.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.640]   We know it's what designers want.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.360]   You don't feel like they're hitting the mark though with this Windows 10 stuff.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.840]   Personally, Windows 10 Consumer, I think, is a dog.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.840]   Windows 10--
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.240]   Well, I'm telling consumers, the days of the default computer you should buy for your
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.280]   home being a Windows PC are long gone.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.920]   I'm telling consumers, get a Chromebook for 90% of what you do.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.880]   You'd be nuts to get a full service operating system.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.880]   And even if you do, there's no particularly compelling reason to prefer Windows over Mac
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   over Linux.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.080]   Well, Chromebooks have a couple of key weaknesses.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.840]   They're lousy gaming PCs.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.320]   Gaming is the only reason to get Windows.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.280]   They have a five-year lifespan.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   And you can't print with them.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.080]   Sorry, you can't, was it?
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   You can print it.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   You actually can print it.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   You can print it.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.360]   All the modern printers will print just fine with a Mac with their Chrome.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.360]   I still have issues.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.720]   Well, OK, you can't scan with them.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   All right, you can print with them.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   You can't scan with them.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   Maybe you can't scan with them.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.560]   You cannot-- yeah, scanning is definitely not sure.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.560]   So I have an Epson printer that scans to Google Cloud, which actually is usually what
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.200]   I want, because if I'm scanning, it's because I'm going to share a document with somebody
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   usually.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.120]   So I scan it to Google Cloud, and then I have access to it.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.200]   I can use a Chromebook 90% for what I do.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.760]   No, I mean, this is my travel machine and my--
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.760]   Yeah, you're using Pixel.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.760]   --my sit-at-home machine.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.440]   Harry's using an iPad.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.440]   This is a very heterogeneous budget.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.680]   But instead of in the office, I'll have a dual boot Windows Linux system, which I
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.440]   can then use in the way that I want and still get good gaming before.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.280]   I would submit Windows 10 is fine.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   I think for most people.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.680]   Doesn't the nacking of it really piss you off?
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.400]   OK, there's another issue.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.640]   Windows is now-- in fact, Microsoft is now putting ads not only in the startup menu.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.920]   They're putting it everywhere.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.760]   In fact, this new creators update apparently has a new ad unit.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.400]   Most of the time-- the ads are for Microsoft products, but not always.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.160]   There's an ad Paul Thorett was talking about.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.960]   Pops up for Dropbox, which is-- or box.com, maybe it's box.com.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.680]   In the middle of your computing--
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.240]   But you can turn that off, but you've got to know what to turn off, and it's not obvious.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.240]   Exactly.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.600]   I want a computer operating system, which allows me to do what I want to do.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.040]   I do not want little pop-up messages going.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.400]   This would be so much faster if you did it an edge.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   You should maybe just--
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   Well, that's why I use it.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   I'll screw that up.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   I am very happy with Linux.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.360]   I think this is the year of Linux on the desktop.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360]   Leo.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   Leo.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.280]   No one has ever said that it meant it.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.040]   I meant it, and I mean it.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.600]   I think Linux is actually quite mature.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.760]   The Linux kernel has gotten to the point now where it works with almost all modern PC
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.380]   hardware, including-- like I had-- I thought I'm never going to get Linux on this HP
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.560]   Spectre 13T, you know, the copper one.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.520]   I put arched Linux on it.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.520]   It works great.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.520]   It was easy to install.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.520]   All the hardware works.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.520]   Linux is very mature now.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.840]   The kernel has built-in support for almost all PC hardware.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.360]   The desktops are elegant.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   What's missing is Adobe.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.800]   Well, which you could do in the cloud for their cloud-based stuff, but like-- or you
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.280]   could buy crumbs of-- I guess I'm just saying-- I'm not arguing that Linux isn't worthy
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.880]   when I'm arguing is anybody normal.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.800]   Like my mom is never going to buy a Chromebook.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.560]   And she'd be, by the way, using Linux if she did.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.240]   Well, of course, she'd be using a variation of Ubuntu.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.000]   But I mean in terms of we're saying Linux on the desktop, we don't mean a Chrome.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.200]   With your mom-- and somebody like your mom should buy a Chromebook.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.080]   I mean, what is mom doing that she would need a desktop operating system?
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.200]   My mom plays bridge with complete strangers online, which she--
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   Good, fine.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   --find a Chromebook.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.200]   You know, I mean--
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   Well, it depends what protocol.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   I mean, I'm not sure.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.760]   But she's also spent two years learning how to use Windows 7 with frequent support.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   I feel--
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.760]   I feel--
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   --because I'm a phone teller.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   Hello, mom.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   You're a phone teller.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   Do you know how many calls I get on the radio show?
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.760]   I got a call today.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   Woman says, "I'm savvy.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.760]   I'm very suspicious."
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.960]   But there was a pop-up that said, "Call this number.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.600]   You've got a problem with your computer."
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.200]   She got a guy in India who immediately took control of her computer and changed the password.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   I mean--
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.760]   --this happens all the time, but it doesn't happen on a Chromebook.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   I don't think--
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760]   No, no.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.840]   It's possible to tell people to buy Windows.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.360]   --security-wise, it's good.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.560]   It'll do pretty much everything you need within reason.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.360]   It's hard to screw up.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.920]   It's his hard to screw up, but without a good internet connection, it's of limited use.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.000]   But who doesn't have an internet connection nowadays?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   A lot of people.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Well, what are they using their computer for?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   But that was the whole point.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.920]   You used to be able to use a computer without an internet connection.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   It's a calculator.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.480]   What are you using a computer for that you can't-- if you don't have internet?
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.240]   I could cheerfully play civilization for 12 hours straight and never even touch my--
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   Gaming connection.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.440]   --comes back to gaming.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   Yeah, probably.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.520]   Or sometimes you're in a situation where you're out and you're trying to work on a document
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.600]   and maybe you don't have internet connection and then you have to deal with the offline
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.920]   stuff and how is that going to stink.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   I mean, it--
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.520]   When's the last time you did that, Christina?
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.520]   Well, OK.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.800]   Last time I tried to use a Chromebook, I was trying to use something in the field and then
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.080]   I was able to make it work once I connected, but I had to use my phone as a hotspot.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.440]   I mean, it's still ultimately, for me, as a work machine, I could never use it because
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.720]   there are instances when I might be in a cab and I'm working on a story and I need to
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.680]   write something and then I can't trust that it's going to locally store the stuff that
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.840]   I need and then update it.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.560]   I mean, for most people-- and these are edge cases.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.840]   I'm not trying to say that for most people a Chromebook wouldn't be fine.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.840]   I think you're right.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.840]   It would be.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   It's what you're doing is hanging out on Facebook and reading your email.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   Oh, of course.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   It was my primary machine for about a year.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.760]   Although I used it primarily at the office where I had to connect to--
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.040]   I think you're brave to be using an iPad Pro as your primary computer.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   How's that working out?
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040]   Just fine.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.560]   I've been using various iPads for five years.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.640]   And everything you want to do, you can do there.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.640]   99%.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.120]   Well, you could probably do it on a Chrome as well.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.120]   Sometimes it's just different.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.680]   You don't do things the same way you do on a Mac or PC.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.680]   You have to rethink it.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.680]   Sometimes they're quite different, but it's not that you can't do them the most things.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.280]   I think-- here's my take on this Apple briefing.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.640]   If you look at the ads Apple's running right now, it's all about use an iPad Pro instead
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.560]   of a PC, isn't it?
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.360]   I really think this is a holding--
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360]   It's a phone book.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.840]   Well, instead of anything, it's like anything you do on a computer you could do on your iPad.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.920]   I think this is a holding action on Apple.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.280]   They plan in two years to start phasing Mac OS out.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.040]   They want to move everybody to iOS.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.200]   I don't know about that, but it does seem pretty likely that when the iPad first came
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.560]   out, they thought there would be a much more rapid move to new wave type computing devices.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   But now tablet sales are static or falling.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.160]   You know, there's a great article.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.440]   I want to point to Neil-- and I've done this before on another show, so I apologize if
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.440]   I'm repeating myself.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.160]   Some of our listeners know this.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.920]   Neil Seibart and above Avalon.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.400]   If you take out the iPad mini sales, which have plummeted because everybody has a big
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.440]   phone now, they don't need a mini-- iPad sales are not bad.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.920]   Unit sales are better than Mac sales, obviously.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   Price--
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.920]   Slightly.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   They're not doing it, but they're not drinking unless they seem to be--
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   It's not bad.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.680]   See, that red is the Mac mini on this graph here.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   It's not--
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.560]   Not as depressed as it looks.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.560]   Well, what would happen?
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.320]   And I think you're going to see a big bump as they just announced a $329 iPad.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.680]   Which actually can compete with a Chromebook pretty well.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.840]   A lot of people are going to come into-- yeah, by the way, when I say Chromebook, iPad would
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.800]   also be a very good choice for those people.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:11.120]   At $329, I predict the next quarter or two, you're going to see iPad sales research.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.280]   There are a lot of people with older iPads.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.680]   What they didn't anticipate is that an iPad would be good for four or five years.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   Yeah, that's it right there.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   I would be tough.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   Because when you saw--
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   I would be tough.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   Exactly.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.880]   I mean, I would say that that's what they didn't anticipate.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.520]   Because I looked back at something I wrote a couple of years ago on the fifth anniversary
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.000]   of the iPad and whether we were all wrong or not.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.960]   Because at that point, two years ago, we hadn't kind of seen this research on the iPad
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.480]   Pro and things like that.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.760]   And because the iPad was like, I think it's like seven years old this week, I think.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.200]   And yeah, I think you're right.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.160]   I think that you had these couple of years of tremendous growth.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.640]   And Apple and everybody else kind of anticipated, oh, well, this is going on.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.320]   It's going to be the new iPhone.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.400]   And then what happened was everybody had an iPad and realized, oh, I don't need it for
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.320]   four years or so.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.520]   I'm going to buy my mom, for instance, the new one, the $329 iPad for her birthday.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.000]   So if mom is watching in August, you'll be getting a new iPad.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.720]   But this will be the third iPad.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   I've bought her.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.400]   I bought her the original iPad 3G.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.560]   And then I got her an iPad 4 with LTE.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.440]   And that was, I guess, 2012.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.600]   So this will be the first time in nearly five years that I've gotten her an iPad and she
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.160]   uses her iPad more than she uses her MacBook.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.640]   And but the reason I haven't.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   My point is all of Apple's revenue comes from the iPhone.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.240]   We acknowledge that.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.560]   But I think they really do want to replace Mac OS with iOS.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560]   I think eventually, absolutely.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:41.360]   As soon as iOS is as capable and it's rapidly closing in according to Harry as a PC or as
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   a Mac OS.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   I think they're going to do it.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.920]   But that's why they're not going to do touch on the Mac.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.400]   By the time we put on touch on the Mac, you'll be using iOS.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.200]   By the way, you saw the memo from Imagination, the company that made the GPUs for the iPhone
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   3, 2007.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.120]   Arm is the, it's like Arm, right?
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.080]   They're a chip, fabulous chip company that do a design that Apple incorporates.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.280]   Basically, all they've got now is MIPS.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   And that's not going to do it.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.840]   It seems to me like imagination is switching around and it's becoming an intellectual property
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   harvesting group.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.640]   Oh, that would be bad.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.120]   So Imagination put out a note because they had to let the stockholders know they were publicly
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.120]   traded company.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.480]   In fact, the stock went down 60% when the note came out.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   I know.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.640]   That Apple has told them they're in a couple of years not going to be using their designs
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640]   anymore.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.480]   And Imagination said, by the way, we don't think they can do that.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.440]   We think that there's no way they can clean room a GPU that will plug in and replace
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.640]   what we're giving them.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   And then they're going to-
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   Of course they can.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.640]   Yeah, of course they can.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.840]   They have, they've been hiring a GPU and chip designers.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   Exactly.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.840]   For years.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.160]   Plus they're willing to fight this out in the courts.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.280]   I mean, Apple lawyers sit in a darkened room somewhere in Cupertino, sharpening their teeth
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.560]   with the bones of their enemies.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.640]   And it's just they would love to be let loose on their wing.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.280]   But more to the point, this is the kind of thing a company does.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.480]   A, when it wants to own everything, it's going to try to buy Toshiba's NAND production.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.360]   It wants to own all the hardware as Samsung does, by the way, which is why Samsung is
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.320]   the biggest threat to Apple right now.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.920]   And not only do they want to own all the hardware, on the hardware manufacturer, this
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   is a step towards making the iPad and the iPhone as powerful as a PC.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   Absolutely.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.800]   I fully think that Apple, this meeting, we'll end this now because we've talked enough
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:33.840]   about it, but this meeting, this briefing that Apple gave this week is merely a holding
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.840]   action.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:40.440]   And what was missing, and I know that Matthew and Ina and everybody else knows this, is
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.680]   the admission that Apple ultimately isn't going to be making Max anymore.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   They denied it.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   They said, "No, no, no.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.120]   We love the Mac."
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.880]   Just like they said Apple too forever.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.400]   Well, that's right after the Mac came out.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.240]   In terms of a margin perspective, that is going to hurt them a little bit.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.800]   Yeah, because the Mac is a high price.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.240]   Yeah, they make crazy bank on the MacBook Pros, and you're not going to get the same from
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.240]   my pads.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.640]   Yeah, they made it too good.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.000]   People don't need new ones as fast.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.600]   I really, my bet is the Mac will be out around a lot longer than at least you expect Leo.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   I hope so, because I love that.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   I think so too.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.840]   It's going to be a long time before people sit in doing desktop publishing, and most people
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.840]   doing video editing.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.880]   People who just want to accomplish things in the same way they have for the last 10 or
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   15 years.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.680]   I don't deny there's a market.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.120]   The question is, if that market's big enough for Apple to even bother with?
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.120]   Well, how do you build iPad apps, if you don't?
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.240]   Honestly, until you have Xcode running on iOS, or you're a way away from them, then you
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   can't replicate with me.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   Are we away from that?
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   I don't know.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   I think we are.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.200]   I think we are.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.040]   I think that they could technically do it.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.360]   We'll see what they do at WWDC, but we haven't seen a mobile first IDE from anyone.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.360]   Now, that's not just Apple.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.920]   We haven't seen this from Google or Microsoft either.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   So until we can really see...
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.520]   If Apple announces Xcode for the iPad in June at WWDC, will you then say?
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.520]   Okay, that's it.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.720]   I'm not going to say that's it because I think that it's much more nuanced than that.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   I think Carrie is right.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.160]   I think it's got a lot longer life than that.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.680]   But will I think that is more?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.320]   I think is that more on the term?
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   Sure.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.600]   But I mean, I think that A, it's a high-mersion product.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.800]   P, there are even though the average consumer, I think they would love to move them to iOS.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   I think you're right.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   You're right.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:29.040]   I think that's the way that they move a lot of people to the iPad.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.040]   There are plenty of people and it's not insignificant.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:38.800]   The fact is they still sell 5 million max a quarter and very high-mergents who rely on
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   Mac OS.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   I don't foresee them being able to...
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   I think it's going to be a ways off before they can replace that.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.200]   Merging Android apps into the Chrome OS.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.600]   It doesn't work particularly well at the moment, but it will.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.440]   No, it doesn't.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.200]   But again, Google still doesn't have an IDE that will work on Chrome OS.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.360]   So you know what I'm saying?
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.840]   So you're not wrong, but I think that for both of these, until you actually get to the
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.920]   point where you can develop your applications on these alternative operating systems, the
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.360]   desktop's not going to go away.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.360]   No.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.920]   In fact, they kind of pointed to that at that meaning they said that really maybe the
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.880]   largest group of pro developers are developers using Xcode and they said Xcode downloads
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.200]   are growing fast.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.360]   So I hope you're right because I love Mac OS.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.560]   I'd like to keep using Mac OS.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.800]   I'm very happy with Linux.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.240]   It is the year of Linux on the desktop.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.080]   Every year, every year, we're going to pull it out.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   Twenty years, Leo.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   It's been twenty years.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   It is.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.440]   You know, and I would actually have a very hard time using an iPad.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.520]   I'm amazed that you were able to do that to do that.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.000]   That keyboard I have to say, it was like it would knock on my fingers within minutes.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.760]   You could tell Harry uses it though.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   You'll follow us.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.760]   No, no, no.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   You've won.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.760]   This is my second on two.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.400]   And actually my primary complaint about the iPad Pro is that the keycaps.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.400]   Give me your keyboard.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.160]   I've got to show people.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   You can just detach.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   It's kind of embarrassing.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.160]   No, it's not embarrassing.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   It's just no.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   It's how much fun it's called.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160]   This is how much he types.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   And that's my second one.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.440]   I'm just going to miss the E is rubbed off.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.760]   I don't even know what these letters are.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.600]   They start to wear off within a few weeks.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.280]   I'm amazed that this is still true a year and a half after this thing first shift.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.560]   The A and the S and the E are more enough.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.400]   Now I typically think that T is the second most used character for some reason.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.800]   You're just not using the definite article as much as you ought to.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   Harry had a detriment.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.440]   You use that more often.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.120]   Wow, that is wild.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   Harry McCracken is here.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.200]   He's from Fast Company.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.440]   I'm still calling him the technologizer.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.040]   He's @Harry McCracken on Twitter and on Mastodon.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.080]   No, Mastodon and Harry McCracken.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.040]   We'll talk about Mastodon a little bit.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.600]   I should get technologizer.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   I think you should.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   You still can.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.920]   That's the beauty of Mastodon.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.960]   No name is safe.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.480]   Christina Warren is here at Film_Girl from Gizmodo.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.840]   Great to have you.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:02.840]   And Ian Thompson from the register.co.uk who still visits us in Petaluma even though he
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.960]   can't get cream in a can.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.400]   I know the British food shop is shut down.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.000]   No more pasties, no more twigglers, no more, you know, sad.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Sad, but sad.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.080]   I'm having to get my fix from other places now.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.840]   PG Tips must come from elsewhere now.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.720]   Oh, I buy them from, but PG Tips I buy in 240 bag.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   Yeah, me too.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   Actually, although I'm lately Yorkshire Gold is my new.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   I know.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.760]   I was born in Yorkshire, so I should prefer Yorkshire Gold, but I've just been drinking
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   PG for too long.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.760]   Yeah, it's a classic.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.760]   It's my favorite.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   It's either one is good.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.760]   Either one is better than anything else.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.280]   It's the equivalent of a session beer, you know, it's like a drink at all day.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.280]   All day.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.840]   Our show today brought to you by The Tracker.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   Look at this.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.840]   I got one.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.840]   Oh, I lost my tracker.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.240]   What happens when you lose your tracker?
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   No, no.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.400]   This is the device.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.480]   The blue, I got it right here.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:56.160]   This is the Bluetooth device that you pair to your phone, iOS or Android, and then you
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.200]   will stop looking for lost things.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   It always happens, doesn't it?
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.640]   That you, you can't find your keys when you're late for work, right?
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   You can't, you can't find your luggage when you're ready to pack.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.920]   You can't find things when you need the most.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.980]   Newsweek says the average American spends almost an hour a day losing searching for stuff
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.720]   they've lost that they know they have, but they've lost.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.360]   All you got to do is attach the tracker to it about the size of a quarter, very lightweight,
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.640]   anodized aluminum.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.720]   This is using Bluetooth LE to pair to your phone.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.720]   Your phone's got the GPS.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.520]   The tracker's got the Bluetooth.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.920]   You can set up separation alerts.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.000]   So if you leave your device, whatever the tracker's attached, let's say it's your keys.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.920]   If you leave your keys behind your phone house, you leave your phone behind your tracker
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.760]   house, there's even a button on the tracker you can press that makes your phone scream
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.840]   even if it's silenced.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   So, and by the way, they've got this great distance indicator on the tracker app so you
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.320]   can warmer, warmer, colder, colder.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.600]   You can actually, you'll know if you're getting closer to your item.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.200]   I love that.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.640]   Family sharing lets you track the same tracker Bravo from multiple phones.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.720]   So that's really handy too.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.040]   I love the tracker, whether it's for keys, wallets, bags, computers, whatever, even animals.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:11.400]   This tracker is about the size and less than the weight of a dog tag and they have a special
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.440]   waterproof cover you could put on this.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.000]   A lot of people use it on their pets, the tracker.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.160]   So the best part about the tracker, if you scroll down, they have sold now and this number's
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.880]   out of data, it's more than this.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:30.720]   But as of last count, 4.5 million trackers, that means it has the largest crowd GPS network
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   in the world.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.600]   That's people all over the world that are using the tracker software.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:42.840]   If you lose your keys and your keys get hijacked and end up in Dubai, somebody using the tracker
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.440]   software in Dubai, when they wander by your keys, their software is going to, "I see Leo's
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.560]   keys" and it's going to send a message to me and I'm going to see on my phone, "Hey,
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.840]   your keys were last seen in Dubai."
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.360]   That is awesome.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.920]   That is awesome.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.360]   30-day money back guarantee, no reason not to try it.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.680]   I know you're going to love it, you're never going to lose your stuff again.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.360]   And by the way, unlike a lot of other Bluetooth trackers, this one has a replaceable battery.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.640]   So the other guys, when the battery dies, you throw the thing out and you get a new one,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.960]   not with a tracker, these are just those little coin size batteries you get to the drugstore.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.200]   Stop losing stuff today.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.160]   Stop searching for stuff.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.240]   Stop being late for work.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.200]   Go to the tracker.com and hit the promo code TWIT.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.480]   Make sure you get your order together and you'll get a free tracker bravo with any order.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.080]   We're just going to throw that into the box.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.080]   THETRAACKR.COM.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.080]   Yeah, they spell it funny.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.240]   It's going to be the hardest thing to find today.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.360]   Not just the website, not your keys.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:45.440]   THETRAACKR.COM, promo code TWIT and they'll throw in a free tracker bravo with any order.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   That's a nice deal.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.440]   Okay.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.920]   So, for that, Craig Federighi and Phil Schiller and the...
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.120]   How come you guys weren't invited?
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.720]   I would have invited you guys to this meeting.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   How about that?
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.400]   We've been blanklisted by Apple for about 10 years.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.080]   Admittedly, Deadlines like Dead...
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   What did the register do?
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.640]   Headlines like what?
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.080]   Dead Steve Jobs is still a crook, judge rules?
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.600]   Oh, you're never going to get invited now.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.160]   Well, no, but...
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.880]   I want to wangle an invitation because it will be later this year, September probably,
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.200]   with the new iPhone announcement that they'll open up the new campus, right?
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.160]   They're people moving in already this month.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:26.120]   There were rumors they might invite journalists in April, although that seems extremely unlikely.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.400]   By the way, good point.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.560]   No April event, I don't think.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   It doesn't say that.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.560]   April event.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.560]   No, it's just...
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.560]   No, it's just Deadra, but I thought...
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.560]   The Hadra, but I thought...
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.560]   The theater is available, yes.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.560]   Have they actually finished that?
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.800]   Because that's why they're going to be doing all their events from now, is that custom?
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   Right.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   I'm from the beautiful theater.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.200]   Most of it's underground, so if the journalists do anything wrong, they can fill the room with
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   the ads.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.280]   Just drown them like the rats there.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.720]   They have the world's largest dome lid, carbon fiber lid on that thing.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.600]   It's all one piece.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.000]   You know, companies are in trouble when they start spending that much money on their head
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.160]   courses.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160]   That's always...
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.560]   It's like being on the cover of Sports Illustrated for a football quarterback.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.560]   You wouldn't understand.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   It's...
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.040]   Well, armored rugby, you mean?
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.040]   Armored rugby.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.960]   It's almost inevitably the sign that companies peaked when they build the massive headquarters.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.160]   Although, Apple, Facebook and Google, all three are doing massive new headquarters.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   Unsalesfuls.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   Unsalesfuls?
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   All right.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.280]   UBS, which is a bank company, an investment company.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.760]   They have analysts.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:34.400]   They have released a research note, which Business Insider is quoting, saying that Apple
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:41.920]   has more than a thousand engineers working on augmented reality in Israel and Robert
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.200]   Scoble might be right.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.760]   It doesn't say that in the note.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.800]   But this may appear on the new 10th anniversary iPhone.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.840]   Remember, they acquired PrimeSense, which made the Connect Sensor.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   Mattio, which kind of lets you overlay...
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.920]   Look at products and then overlay different colors and finishes.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.120]   Apple Face, which is face recognition in another Israeli company.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.640]   Apple, in the dark behind the scenes, may be working hard on AR.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.360]   But you got to think companies like Google and Microsoft, which have been doing this for
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.040]   a long time, also are working on it.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.640]   Will Apple beat them to the punch?
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.040]   Will they have to?
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.440]   No, that's a good question.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.600]   They do they even have to.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   Whole lens is delayed.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.440]   I mean, it's a development kit now, but it won't be out till 2019, Microsoft.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:36.560]   Oculus has mostly been gaming and hasn't been really been the success.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.800]   If we're honest, Apple's demo has never really been that they're the first in a market.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.440]   It's just usually that they're the best.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   Just be the best.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.320]   So, I guess my question would be for you guys.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   Does it matter?
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   Do they need to beat them?
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.040]   Or do they just need to have the best of implementation?
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.040]   I don't know.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.160]   One of the things that really encouraged me about this article was that they were going
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.720]   for AR rather than VR.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.080]   Because I think VR is a really big dead end.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:03.000]   Because most of the money, most of the software is going to be focused on AR or mixed reality.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.520]   VR is a few key locations until they work out the whole movement and vomit deal.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.920]   But with AR, you can get really useful stuff going.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.880]   You've got a great selection of apps that you get in.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.720]   You can really personalize it.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   It's going to be tricky.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.000]   But I think Apple are playing catch up on this, but they're willing to throw large amounts
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   of money.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.480]   And as you say, they're not usually the first to do stuff, but they're usually the best
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.480]   at doing it for the short term.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   Are they still?
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.280]   Well, this is the problem they used to be.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.720]   I mean, it's given the last couple of years I have my doubts.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.920]   But at the same time, Microsoft is doing very well with HoloLens, but isn't selling particularly
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.920]   well.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   It's very expensive.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   Well, it's a developer thing.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.400]   It's a $3,500 developer.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.400]   Exactly.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.440]   Microsoft has been doing it in public.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.980]   Apple's generally speaking up at least up until the time they've talked about their Mac
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.320]   Pro for two years from now.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   You usually don't do stuff in public.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.320]   Exactly.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   It'll be behind the scenes.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.320]   Right.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.880]   Instead of releasing this developer kit, they'd be much more likely to put off talking about
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.120]   anything until they had something spectacular, which Microsoft didn't do.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.440]   Microsoft has something which is not yet transcendent.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.080]   That is really interesting.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:18.680]   I would also be a little cautious about thinking that Apple, having a thousand people means
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.080]   that much given the year.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.160]   They probably had a thousand people on their Titan project.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   Exactly.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.560]   We thought that they were planning to do something incredible with cars because they had hired
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.560]   vast numbers of people.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   They can afford to.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.240]   And now at least the conventional thinking is they're not planning to do anything incredible
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.720]   with cars in the short term.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.720]   It's funny.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.160]   Apple used to be knocked for not doing enough R&D for having too small a fraction of their
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.080]   budget devoted to R&D.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.760]   Clearly they need to find the next thing.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:51.400]   The iPhone is, it's hard to think of what you would do to make not just iPhone, better
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.400]   phone period.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   They've been scooped a little bit.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.440]   Samsung, Samsung, Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 are bezel-less.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.880]   I think Apple will do bezel-less.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.640]   No, found future will be bezel-less.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.520]   We can do that now.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.520]   Why can we do that?
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.440]   By the way, why didn't they do that before?
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.880]   Do you not make screens big enough?
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.360]   I think it takes a certain amount of investment into the screen technology itself.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.600]   People were slightly concerned that, you know, I mean there's a cost factor as well.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:24.360]   I'm excited because I ordered an S8, which is a 5.7 inch screen and it's roughly the
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.360]   same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, which is a 5.5 inch screen.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.640]   It's a little smaller, I think in some ways, a little bigger than others.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   It's a little bit taller.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:40.120]   The LG and Samsung both are doing basically a two by one screwdriver.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   They're strikingly tall.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   What's with the extra real estate is height.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   It's kind of weird.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   It actually works.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.960]   I think people will get used to it very quickly.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.280]   Right now it's very striking.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.880]   You're getting this very tall display.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:54.320]   The desire is, I mean, and some people even say the 7 Plus is too wide, is to one-handed
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.320]   operation, right?
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.320]   So it's a little narrower.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:59.280]   And both of the galaxies fit very well in the hand.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   Have you played with them?
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   Did you go to New York?
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.480]   I wouldn't go to New York, but I wrote about them.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   Oh, nice.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.920]   And I've got a little bit of hands-on time with both of them.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.920]   So I'm excited.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   I ordered one.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.960]   I won't get it for it till a week from Friday.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.960]   But I'm excited.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.920]   I think this might be very, very nice.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:20.480]   I feel in the minority on this one, I think one-handed uses it's cute, but I like the
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.480]   function too.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   I don't mind too.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   No, I don't mind.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.120]   But I mean, I'm having a big argument with the wife because she's just got her iPhone
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   6S.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.000]   And she's got so narrow and she's got tiny little hands anyway, so it makes sense.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.240]   I think women and smaller people probably is a very important thing.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.240]   I don't know.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.760]   But yeah, I mean, it all depends on your hand size and for the record.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   Massive.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   I like a big phone.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   I cannot lie.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   I want it.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   No, it's my computer.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.200]   It's the computer I use more than any other computer.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   So anyway, good.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.040]   Well, so what did you, you only had a little time with it?
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.760]   I went to Samsung's briefing.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.560]   So I got 15 or 20 minutes sometime.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.560]   Face recognition, which we now know you can fool with a picture.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.560]   Although a lot.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.560]   That's always been the case.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.560]   Yes.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.560]   For their stuff.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.560]   The other really cool thing is Bixby, which I couldn't really try, but you know, they
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:11.040]   had this very ambitious assistant that's not just voice control.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.720]   No one's tried it yet because it won't be available till they shipped the phone.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.840]   It has a lot of stuff with vision.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.840]   It's super ambitious.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.400]   What did they say about it?
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.840]   Because I mean, we've had several details about this thing.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:25.320]   It is meant to be the second coming of phone Christ, but it's interesting.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.880]   It has a dedicated hardware button.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.280]   That means it will.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.720]   This is Samsung saying you're not going to want to.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.720]   I know it too.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.360]   This is not the voice assistant you want.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.320]   This is not the voice assistant you want.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.000]   Press the button and Bixby will appear.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.880]   Although somebody's already shown how you can remap that button to be Google assistant
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.880]   or Google search.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:50.280]   And it is yet another example of the challenge of basing your device and somebody else's operating
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.040]   system that Google will do everything that's power to get you to use the assistant at the
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   same time.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.200]   Samsung is saying use Bixby instead.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.440]   You can't really take the Google stuff out of Android though.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.760]   Nobody wants that phone.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.760]   No.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.280]   So what Samsung doesn't everybody else does it to is they have, they duplicate.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   They have the same.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.200]   You feel pulled in two directions in a way you want with an Apple device.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.200]   Right.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   On the other hand, I love the flex.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   It's funny.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.280]   My daughter used iPhones her whole life and she broke it.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.520]   So I gave her an old Android device, the Galaxy S7.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.880]   And then she broke that.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.200]   So now she has an iPhone SE and she misses Android.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.600]   She says, I can trust so much.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   I know it surprised me.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.720]   I didn't expect that at all.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.760]   She didn't miss the blue bubbles because like when I talk to people like honestly, it's
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.080]   it's leaving the I message thing and like I'll own this.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.560]   I'm a terrible classist when it comes to this.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.680]   But if I'm texting with someone and like it goes from like a degree.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.400]   I'm totally like Sarah.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:57.080]   One of my very good friends, Sarah is a green bubble person and every single time I'm like,
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.440]   your husband is a doctor.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.600]   What are you doing?
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:04.280]   I do have to say messages.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.800]   The only thing missing from messages is cross platform.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.520]   You can use messages on the desktop.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.840]   That's key for me.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:18.560]   You can do all these great stickers and animated gifts and the fireworks and all that stuff.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.600]   And I would love to see this in a cross platform because if but Apple will never do this.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.560]   But if there were an Android version of messages done, right?
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   So it's interesting.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.560]   Apple's never going to do that.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.520]   And Google seems to not understand what message messaging is at all.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   Don't get it.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.520]   They can't come up with anything.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.680]   No, they can't come up with things Leo.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.280]   They just have six different apps for it and they can give you an interview every six months.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   That's all.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.280]   But they absolutely can.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   They just keep giving us something new.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.360]   They're pushing this new rich communication services, RCS over MMS and SMS.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.200]   They're hoping the carriers will adopt it overseas somehow.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.800]   But at just a time when everyone in half a brain is moving to signal, you know, they
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.480]   have mucked around with messaging for the last two years.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.720]   It's been driving the users insane.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.000]   Nobody likes the system they've got set up and now we're all getting smart.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Right.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.040]   You know, actually, down the road, the other thing.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.240]   And they're like, we got it.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.440]   In a way, Google's opened the door to that because Android will let you use signal as
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.440]   your SMS app.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.440]   Indeed.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.560]   So it won't send an encrypted SMS, but you still only have to use one app.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.480]   You could put it in your dock and use it all the time.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   But with certain, I mean, using.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.640]   If I'm a Google file user, which means all my messages come through Hangouts anyway,
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.080]   so I have to use Hangouts, which is.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.560]   Which now they're like deprecating seems to be rapidly.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.480]   Well, I don't, you know, they're not deprecating it.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.360]   They're moving it to the business side.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:40.880]   So it's designed for G Suite users more than I don't, you know, but isn't that deprecating
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.880]   it for the consumer?
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   Yes.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.880]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.120]   And messaging is one of the most important.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   And Google Assistant won't do SMS and never has.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.600]   And it should if you if you aloe their Google Assistant Messenger, if it did SMS, they'd
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   be done.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.960]   I don't understand what's wrong with them.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.680]   Anyway, I don't don't get me started.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.560]   I don't think Google is doing right.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.880]   And I'm very impressed with is YouTube.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:09.040]   YouTube just topped one billion hours of video a day.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.040]   That means it's well on its way to beating television viewing.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.680]   And now, look at here's, here's the graph from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.480]   TV is fairly flat, the red line.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   And the thing is millennials, people under say 25 don't even watch TV.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.520]   When I look at my son, it's all YouTube baby.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.680]   So Google released this week.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.160]   We knew about it for a while, but it's out now.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.960]   YouTube TV and OMG.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.680]   You can use it Christina because you're in New York.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.680]   I can use it.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.680]   Yeah, I reviewed it.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.680]   I bought it.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.680]   I don't even need it.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   I have a cable subscription.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   We'll get a month for it.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   I have the one month or whatever.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   I do the one month trial.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.240]   I tell you, I may end up keeping it for a couple of reasons.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   First of all, it is limited.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.400]   I mean, these are the live channels in San Francisco or the locals.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.800]   So I have Fox, CBS, NBC, ABC and CW.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:07.200]   You've got a lot of sports, ESPN one and two, the SEC, the ESPN, U ESPN news here in the
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:12.400]   Bay Area, Fox Sports one and two, NBC Sports Networks.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.720]   We've got the Sports Bay Area.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.120]   That's where you'll see the Giants baseball sports, California.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.560]   We've got there's a lot of sports.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.400]   There was an awful lot of sports.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   BTN sports.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.360]   But they have two of the news, not three, they have FX or I'm sorry, Fox Sports.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.360]   And MSNBC, they don't have CNN.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.360]   No, they don't have any of the CNN.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.960]   That's a Viacom issue, right?
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.360]   They don't have a Viacom or TV.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.360]   Yes.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.360]   And it's a huge problem.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.360]   It is a problem.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.360]   They have Bravo.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   They have all the NBC and Disney.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.080]   They have all the NBC, Fox, Disney and AMC is coming, but they do not have Viacom.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.760]   Now, Viacom is kind of hating all these deals.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.360]   They famously pulled out of being.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   Are they still a hula partner?
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   Viacom.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   A hula partner?
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   Hula partner.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:03.640]   Right now, they are, but it's not clear if they are going to be part of Hulu Live.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.920]   Originally, they'd announced that they were going to be and now it's not clear.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.480]   So they just, they just conflicted.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.040]   They don't know anything about Viacom.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.600]   Yeah, Viacom is very much not happy with any of these bundles.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.160]   The Turner thing though is interesting because obviously, you know, they're in the process
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.520]   of trying to get, you know, time Warner or AT&T acquiring time Warner.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.240]   They'll be part of, they're part of both right now.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.240]   But they'll be part of the people.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.240]   But exactly.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.640]   Now if they go to AT&T, that means it'll be on direct TV now AT&T is over the top.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.200]   Wait, it is already on direct TV now.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   It's already on direct TV now.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.200]   It's already on PlayStation.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   It's on slang.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   But it's not on Google.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   It's not, no, it's not.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:42.600]   YouTube TV is the one service right now that does not have any of the Turner properties,
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.800]   which is a problem because T&T, TBS, Cartoon Network are very, CNN are all very popular
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   cable networks.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.360]   And for me, us old folks like Turner Classic movies.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.120]   For you, black and white, we've got it.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.560]   As young folks like it too.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.560]   They're younger.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   I'm not that young.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.560]   Some colorized.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.560]   But yeah, no.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   That's a big.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   So that explains it.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.120]   See, I was wondering, Christina, now I thank you for being here.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.920]   You explained this.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.080]   Nevertheless, I am so impressed with YouTube TV.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.400]   It's a good start.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.680]   That I mean, there has an unlimited DVR.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.800]   And it's, by the way, the best user interface of any of these, right?
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.960]   Including your cable company.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.640]   If you look at the live TV grid and you hover your mouse over, you can actually see what's
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.240]   playing in real time.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.320]   And if you want a DVR something, it's one click.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.320]   One tap.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   And of course, all of them.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Automatically.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.080]   It's unlimited DVR storage.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.280]   There's net, you never run out.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.920]   And they do wipe it out after any individual recording after nine months.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   Oh, they do.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.560]   Well, that's, that's most of the cases.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.560]   Most of them have a limit.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.560]   Nine months is decent.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.560]   Yes, it is.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.560]   And there's six user profiles that you can have in your family and then up to three consecutive
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.480]   streams at one concurrent streams at once.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.000]   Three streams at once is actually really good.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.960]   I think PlayStation View will technically let you do five, but a lot of times they will
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.000]   limit what types of devices you can use.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.960]   Direct TV lets you do two sling.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.280]   I think maybe let's you do two.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.920]   It depends.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.800]   Hulu hasn't been really clear with what their live product will be, how many they will
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   let you do.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.000]   So three at once for most families.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.080]   I think is fine.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.280]   And then six profiles is really good.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.600]   Yeah, you're right, Harry.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.840]   Only nine months on the DVR, but that I think for most shows that's fine.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.040]   And I have to say, better than most.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:35.680]   And I honestly think the way their DVR is set up right now, you know, it'll record all
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   of your.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.480]   So if you like, you have a show like if you want to record, you know, Bob's Burgers, it
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.440]   will record not just when Bob's Burgers is area in Fox, but also if it were airing in
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.640]   syndication on one of your local channels.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.440]   So it'll do all those instances.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.960]   Playback, I've seen some 720p.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.960]   This is Archer.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.080]   It's best playback speed is 480p, although that's fine.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.920]   Although if you're on show, would you really need more?
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:00.080]   No, but it's not clear what the maximum.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.560]   Have you seen 1080p?
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.560]   I don't think so.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.840]   I've seen 1080 a couple places for for some live stuff I have.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.440]   But yeah, it's mostly like 720.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:14.400]   I will say this though, when it comes to playback, that's been my big, my big like issue whenever
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:19.000]   viewed any other services has been buffering, especially when you're trying to watch things
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   live.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Slink TV is notorious for this.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.960]   Slink TV has a great product, but even now two and a half years after it came out, if
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.800]   I'm trying to watch The Walking Dead on a Sunday or whatever United Air is, you know,
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.720]   an AMC, there's mad buffering and it's not great quality.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.200]   So I'm walking at National Geographic's nature.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.520]   That, if anything, should be at least 720.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.520]   It's not.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.520]   It's 480.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.680]   It's probably fine on an iPad on our phone.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.440]   In fact, the reason I might consider keeping this is more for the mobile than for because
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.440]   I have TV at home.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.440]   Especially right now.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.760]   Right now it's not great on TV.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.760]   They have Chromecast.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.760]   I don't want to watch this.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.760]   They're not on a big screen too.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:56.760]   They're not on any videos.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   They don't have any smart TV deals yet.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.000]   Oh, so that's interesting.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.360]   So it's on Amazon.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.640]   It's on iOS and Android, but you're saying that it's not if I have YouTube, the YouTube
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.960]   app on my Roku, that's not going to have YouTube.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.360]   That's not work.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.960]   Not only that, but also AirPlay doesn't work.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.960]   Chromecast works.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.960]   Chromecast works.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   Chromecast works.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.400]   Chromecast, but only Chromecast.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.720]   So if you have, for instance, I have a TV that has the cast protocol built in, but it does,
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.440]   it's not like Chromecast built in.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:27.480]   So you need to actually have the Chromecast enabled TV or you need to have a physical
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   Chromecast angle.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.960]   I assume because of the DRM, I haven't been able to get clarification to YouTube from
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:32.960]   that.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:37.600]   I reached out, but I have a TV with the cast protocol.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.960]   It'll work with any of my other cast compatible apps.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.440]   It does not work with YouTube TV.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.520]   And that's a huge problem because right now, that means the only way you can watch it on
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:52.000]   the big screen is either to connect a computer to your TV physically or to have a Chromecast.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.120]   And that puts them at a disadvantage because the competitors, Slang, Vue, DirectTV now
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:03.800]   all have apps, at least on the other platforms, at least on Roku, or at least full support
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.200]   AirPlay.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   And so...
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   Now this could change.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.000]   Now this has just been launched and it's only in five cities.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.600]   So it's not even available for most people watching.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.680]   You've got to be in the US in those five cities.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:16.680]   No, agreed.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.840]   It's just, that's more just me saying not to say that it's not a word.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.840]   You should know.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:21.840]   You should know.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.840]   You should know.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.040]   If you're trying to sign up for right now, it is still in the early stages.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.080]   Also if you're trying to sign up right now, AMC, all those channels will be coming.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   They're not there yet.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:35.520]   So if you really care about watching, you know, stuff on AMC, IFC, Sundance, we, whatever,
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:40.200]   you should wait until they actually launch, which will be, they say, sometime soon.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.720]   As long as we're talking about negatives, this doesn't include YouTube Red.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:48.200]   And you know, the original is just not the commercial for you.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.440]   But not commercial for YouTube.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:54.440]   Although you will see, and I think this is a very smart play, you will see YouTube content
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.440]   mixed in with your standard TV content.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.440]   Right.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.880]   That is, which is the right thing to do.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.080]   Well, and so to me, this is really a millennial.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.840]   This is something for millennials who probably never had a cable subscription.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.880]   That's definitely what YouTube is saying.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.280]   That this is not, this is not to get you to cut the cord.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.280]   This is for millennials.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.520]   This is for people who love YouTube and would like a little bit more.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   Right.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.360]   A relatively low price, $35 a month.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:22.800]   I am very, I have to say with all those caveats and negatives, I'm very impressed.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.600]   I think if it's a good product for the millennials, this is a big play.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.440]   And if I were a cable company, I wouldn't have been worried about direct TV now.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.280]   I wouldn't have been worried about PlayStation for you.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.280]   Maybe a little bit sling TV.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.280]   I would worry about this.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.320]   The other thing we did really nicely is search.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:43.720]   The other one's search is incredibly rudimentary.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.280]   And it's not perfect on this.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.120]   I found some places where I expected to find stuff and I couldn't, but you can actually
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:55.800]   go in and search for a show, an episode name, a person, a concept like superheroes.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:58.560]   Type that in, you'll get superhero shows.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.560]   That's nice.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:03.760]   The other one's basically flunking any kind of search other than for programs.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.920]   Can I just say Marvel versus DC?
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   Can I?
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.520]   I only want Marvel super.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.520]   Yeah, there's Marvel.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.080]   Yeah, that's, can I say DC?
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.920]   I wonder if there's only one and it's in Washington DC.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   Others, there we go.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.920]   Yeah, no, let's just go.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   They'll have the flash.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   They have some DC shows.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   In the other one's CW.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   No, that's impressive.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   That's the way I had it.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   Anybody else?
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   This is what, yes.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:28.020]   And this is where the other over the top solutions are really falling down.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.520]   This is a clean interface.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:36.120]   It's easy to use and it's going to, I think, really appeal to people who are watching YouTube
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.120]   all the time.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.200]   I mean, they've been carrying YouTube for so long.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:43.040]   It's been such a cash, cash suck out of the company, but now they actually seem to
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:47.320]   in the last year, 18 months, they seem to have really worked out.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:52.440]   Yeah, okay, we can make some serious bank on this and keep the, and get the next generation
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:56.360]   of people who grew up watching stuff on their computer rather than on their TV.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.140]   I'm pretty darn excited about this.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.140]   It's a good product.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:03.420]   Harry, did you, did you get to see the Hulu live preview?
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.420]   I know that's the one that I don't have any hands on experience with.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:10.940]   Okay, I got to see like a stage, it was a demo, but I got to see a stage demo at CES.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.820]   And I have to say that is probably of all of them, the most impressive one.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:19.060]   If they can bring it to market the way that I saw it, I think the Hulu model is the best
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.060]   one I've seen.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.060]   Tell us about that model.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.060]   What is the model?
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.820]   So it's very similar to what you see with YouTube TV.
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:28.480]   The difference is that it's kind of this perfect combination between on demand programming
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.480]   of Hulu.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.440]   So, you know, the big advantage to Hulu, I think, is that they have this huge catalog
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.400]   of shows, both originals and older content.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.720]   And it's the merger of that and live TV.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.520]   And so the one thing that I would say, and so the one thing I would say that YouTube
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.240]   TV doesn't have as much, and I think YouTube TV is a great start.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.760]   The one thing I would say is that you have some of the legacy content that might be available,
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.940]   you know, depending on licensing deals, through like Fox or NBC or whatever, you can watch
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:55.940]   older shows.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:01.860]   But you don't have this whole catalog of other shows and stuff that Hulu has.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:06.620]   And I think that for a lot of millennials and for a lot of TV viewers, it's when you
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:11.820]   want kind of a holistic television experience, you are intrigued by having the live stuff,
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.340]   especially with sports.
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:16.940]   But a lot of stuff comes down to original content or just the fact that I want to binge
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.140]   watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.460]   And I want to watch those other things.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:27.560]   So I think that if Hulu can bring to market what I was shown at CES, that's has to me
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.360]   is the most compelling I've seen.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.720]   But I think that of the ones that are on the market right now, I think that YouTube TV
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.640]   is a really, really good first effort.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.960]   >> When is Hulu TV coming?
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.800]   >> They say later this year, I don't have any insider information on this.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:46.560]   My gut tells me that we should expect some sort of announcement in May at the new fronts.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.560]   But who knows?
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.640]   All they told me when I spoke to them in January was later this year.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.360]   And I tried to push, I tried to say, well, does that mean like September?
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.360]   Does that mean earlier?
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.080]   And they tried to, they made it seem like it would be earlier than fall.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   But I don't know.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.720]   The fact that Comcast is doing the XFINITY mobile service that Verizon is rumored to
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:09.240]   be doing there, online only service now that you have YouTube TV, you have all these others,
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.800]   it would obviously behoove them to move sooner rather than later.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   But who knows?
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.120]   >> Yeah, and you could probably get away with a few more months.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.160]   I mean, I think this is going to shake.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.760]   This hasn't shaken out yet.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.200]   It's pretty clear though, we are moving very quickly now.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.680]   >> Much of the Twitter still.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.480]   >> Yeah, toward and over the top internet IPTV only world.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.200]   And I think that we can't move fast enough.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.640]   I mean, really what's stymied it, and frankly, the one thing I'd worry about with Hulu TV,
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.160]   Hulu's been so troubled for so long because the founders and its partners couldn't agree
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.120]   on how, what it should be as it adds free services that have ads with subscription.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.720]   What is it, what shows are going to be interesting enough?
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.600]   Hulu TV doesn't have any Viacom shows either.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:59.720]   So it's like these guys are just shooting themselves in the foot constantly.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.920]   Very interesting.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.400]   You mentioned Comcast is getting into the phone business.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400]   I think that's interesting.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.520]   >> It's called absolute hilarity in the office.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.760]   >> And Comcast lousy reputation for customer service.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.600]   Ooh, let's take on mobile phones now.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.160]   >> But you know the only companies in a whole new generation of--
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.880]   >> Wait a minute, the only companies that people hate worse than Comcast are Verizon, AT&T,
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   Sprint, right?
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.880]   >> Right.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.880]   >> I don't know.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.960]   Comcast is certainly Ferrari to ship Comcast.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.880]   There's a special place in hell for the Comcast order now.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.320]   >> It's the evil empire.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:37.400]   So the deal is going to be that it's going to be called XFINITY mobile.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.080]   They're going to get cellular connectivity through Verizon.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.480]   So there are Verizon MVNO.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.360]   But it's really interesting.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.400]   I knew this was happening as soon as Comcast announced, oh, by the way, anybody who gets
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.680]   our XFINITY Wi-Fi router will be just helping the neighborhood out a little bit by offering
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.840]   a free online hotspot.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:03.200]   And if you go downtown in Petaluma, let alone San Francisco or New York, you'll see XFINITY
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.440]   hotspots everywhere.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.200]   >> Yeah, and everyone's sucking everyone else's data around and Comcast doesn't have to pay
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   for it.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.920]   >> And in fact, XFINITY mobile is going to use that whenever possible.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.360]   It was clear they were going to build a mobile service around this.
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.200]   I thought, well, that's clearly what they're up to.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.080]   I worry because reliability on the XFINITY mobile is not great, right?
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:27.880]   Because sometimes it'll join an XFINITY Wi-Fi hotspot and get no connectivity for some reason.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:34.080]   In fact, I ended up telling my phone, whatever you do, do not join XFINITY hotspot.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.520]   So they have six days claim, 16 million Wi-Fi hotspots.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.360]   >> Yeah, Comcast claim they're a customer service for the company as well.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:46.800]   The XFINITY mobile will launch mid-year, available only if you have a Comcast internet
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.120]   or television subscription.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.040]   But you could have, so this is an interesting play.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:57.760]   I could have Comcast internet, YouTube TV or Hulu TV, and Comcast mobile phone service,
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.360]   and then everything would suck.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.360]   >> It's a new trifecta.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.520]   >> I was going to say, wait until--
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.280]   >> Went until the net neutrality rules get trashed by a trash, and then you're going
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.880]   to see quite how much they're going to leverage this in terms of bandwidth.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.880]   >> How so?
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.040]   >> What does you mean next week?
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.040]   >> Yeah, basically.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.840]   >> Yeah, Ajapayas are the news champs.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.840]   >> Yeah, and if she's already said, we're trashing those.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:24.640]   >> Bye-bye, Mr. P
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.440]   >> Just as they trashed the internet, the ISP privacy rule.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.440]   >> Don't get me stoned.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440]   >> Oh, I bet I could get you started.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.440]   >> Oh, I think you probably can.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440]   I could have ran since Pittlefoot.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.440]   >> I could have fired up the boy.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   >> I can help Xfinity in this.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.920]   What will Xfinity do immediately after that?
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:42.960]   >> Well, because that way they can bring down the amount they can prioritize their own traffic.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.880]   They can downgrade everyone else's traffic.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.960]   So if you're an Xfinity mobile customer, you'll get unlimited--
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.560]   >> Well, you'll get Xfinity stuff.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.200]   >> Well, no, this is Comcast we're talking about.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.040]   You'll get a slightly better service in the competition.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.240]   And even then with grudging technical support, we'll actually keep you on the live route.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.840]   >> Well, ATT's already taking advantage of that.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.320]   If you use Direct Daily now, you don't have to pay-- there's no data cost.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   >> You're ready.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   >> Well, you're ready.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.400]   >> How they went after Roku when they tried this the last time, how they've gone over
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.480]   and over under the third party's providers.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.440]   And yeah, you're right, Christina.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.760]   Once those rules go out the window this week, then basically a lot of Americans are going
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.160]   to discover, oh, hang on, things weren't so bad after all.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.640]   >> I don't think this is a very compelling service.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.880]   Besides the problem with Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspots being unreliable, they're going to charge $65
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.880]   a line.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   >> I know.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   >> It was just cheaper than what you pay for some of the-- I mean, it's not cheaper than
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.880]   Tmo, but it's cheaper than, say, Verizon.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880]   >> Verizon.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   >> Yeah, Verizon's like $80.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880]   >> Right.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.360]   Which if you're getting Verizon's cell phone service when you're not on a network is--
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.080]   >> That might be a good reason.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.080]   Yeah, if you like Verizon a lot--
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   >> I have to say, this might be a cheaper way to get Verizon quality data.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.560]   >> I haven't met that many people that like Verizon a lot, and I've got to-- with Tmo
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   bar, the activities good.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.560]   They're data's--
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.760]   >> Yeah, they have great service.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.760]   It's just very expensive.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.600]   You've got Project 5, you've got T-Mobile, for the vast majority of Americans, there are
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.240]   much cheaper options out there.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.080]   And I think the only place this is going to get any play is--
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.080]   >> There's some people who are very large--
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.080]   >> --and those very large--
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.080]   >> -- sensitive-- they're performance sensitive.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   >> Right.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.080]   And there's a part of the country--
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.600]   >> I mean, a lot of people are willing to pay 20 bucks more a month for very good data
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600]   connectivity.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   I would be--
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.240]   >> And I would just say too, I mean, it's-- I obviously live in New York, and I spent
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.720]   a lot of time in the coast, so I'm in a unique position where most--
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.960]   >> Because Verizon is a New York company.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.960]   >> It drives me.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.360]   >> Yes, but also I could get good service from AT&T or from T-Mobile, and I suppose I
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.000]   could even get good service from Sprint, although I wouldn't want to risk it.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.360]   But there are parts of the country where I've been-- where genuinely, you don't get good
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.520]   connectivity from the other places.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.560]   Where Verizon is just kind of-- especially in more rural areas is there.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.560]   So--
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.560]   >> Everybody's bad in rural areas.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.120]   There's nobody getting rural areas.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.400]   >> Yeah, I would agree with that, but I would say that that's where you still, at least in
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.400]   my experience--
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.400]   >> They're not.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:59.040]   >> From AT&T and from Verizon, those two tend to still be best.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.040]   >> Right.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.000]   >> But why carry on paying over the money for a service that you might use once or twice
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.040]   a year when you can just buy a pay as you go sim, take that phone with you and transfer
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.880]   your calls through to it, and carry on paying the lower rate for 10 months of the year?
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880]   This seems to be--
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.880]   >> I mean--
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.880]   >> Well, AT&T Verizon are banking on.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.680]   >> I mean, I guess I'm not saying-- I guess I'm saying that I wouldn't be the target for
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680]   this.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.680]   So more of me--
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.320]   >> If you live in one of those areas where Comcast happens to be your ISP, Comcast happens
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.120]   to live in this area, and now you're going to get better-- like, cricket is going to
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.720]   be terrible, but you could pay and get your better phone service.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:38.440]   >> The funny thing is Comcast says they will not zero rate their own stuff.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.440]   >> Yeah.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.280]   >> Oh, yeah, because they want to charge you through the nose, because Comcast is very
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.600]   famous for having the gigabyte limits on that and how much data you can use.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.520]   So yeah, they're like, no, no, no, each viewable counts towards everything.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.800]   >> Right. >> It seems like this is a good way for Comcast
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.320]   when they're signing up new people to try to sign them up, not just for a triple play,
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.320]   but a quadruple play.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.320]   >> It's a quadruple play.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.320]   >> Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.320]   >> That's the only really--
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.320]   >> Which play here?
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.160]   >> Which for them makes sense, but I mean, they could have attempted to do something that
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.200]   would raise more eyebrows and get more people to consider switching.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:16.040]   They have just one more thing, checklist item when they're signing you up.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   >> Sprint has an unlimited data pricing of $50 a month for a line, so that's cheaper.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.440]   >> Team mobile's unlimited, plan is $70 a month, so that's a little bit more.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:30.520]   Verizon's AT&T, I didn't know, this is $90, but that includes HBO.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.520]   >> Woo hoo.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.520]   >> What?
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.520]   >> It's still my beating heart.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.520]   >> I mean, what?
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.720]   >> It's why you need proper competition in the Telco's market.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.200]   >> But we have four companies, why is that not competition?
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200]   >> A whole four companies.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.200]   >> That's competition, it should be enough competition.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.360]   >> You want to go to London, get a mobile provider, you've got a choice between seven
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.760]   or eight different companies, and they're all driving the price down.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.440]   >> Yeah, I know probably you'll go down before too long.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.360]   >> Yeah, and I hate to tell you this, but this is competition because before six weeks
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.160]   ago, we didn't have any unlimited services.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.160]   >> Right, because team mobile threw down the gauntlet.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.560]   >> Every other company said, all right, I guess we got to do this.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.880]   This is what people want.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.720]   For years they said this isn't what people want.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.200]   >> Ralph, what's- >> Right, it was very famous.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.200]   >> Right, you don't want unlimited.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.200]   Why would you want that?
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.000]   >> Well, yeah, but I mean, Comcast used to the same thing.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.120]   Well, people are happy with the internet speeds they've got.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.440]   They don't really want fiber.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.800]   And then the minute Google fiber starts rolling out-
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.800]   >> It's competition.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.760]   >> Actually, well, some people do in limited areas, coincidentally the ones Google's going
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.680]   into, but you know, and it's just shameless.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.680]   >> I wonder what's going to happen.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.960]   Father Roberts in the chat room, and he always-
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.760]   there's the favorite team mobile plan for geeks, but only geeks know about it because
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.920]   it's on the pay as you go page at the very bottom, a really tiny print, but $30 a month
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.160]   for unlimited data, but you only get 100 minutes of phone, but we don't want to talk to anybody
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.160]   anyway.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.240]   So that is a good deal and is part of the binge on plan.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.000]   I mean, so if you're really data conscious, there are choices out there.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.120]   >> If T-Mobile didn't exist or if John Leger was not the CEO, we'd be way off.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   >> I agree.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   >> Or soft and narrow.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.360]   >> Almost all of innovation has either come from T-Mobile or been in response to T-Mobile.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.360]   >> Absolutely.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.480]   >> And Sprint is just trying to be more T-Mobile than T-Mobile.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:21.120]   >> Sprint is now rather than buying T-Mobile just once T-Mobile to buy them.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.120]   That's the funny thing.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.920]   A year ago, SoftBank was trying to buy T-Mobile, and now a year later, they're like, "Please
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.160]   buy us, please buy us."
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.680]   >> And I really am worried about that because AT&T and Verizon are on their toes.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680]   >> We need the competition.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.480]   >> Because T-Mobile spread exist.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:40.120]   And if we end up with T-Mobile Sprint, I can't imagine that's going to be as good for competition.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120]   >> Yeah.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:45.000]   Now, I mean, this is a T-Mobile really shook the game up in a way that it needed to be
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.840]   done because they were blocked from the last takeover and they're right.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.920]   We've got two choices.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.240]   We can either just hang around and try and get acquired or acquire someone else, or we
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.120]   can really kick some bottom in this market.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.640]   And that's exactly what they did.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.920]   And John's little Jerry's the perfect person to do it because he's crazy as-- well, I
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.920]   can't say exactly how crazy--
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.920]   >> I bet crazy how we see it in the States.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920]   I don't know how to say it.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.920]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.560]   >> That's slightly less broadcastable.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.560]   >> And that's--
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.960]   >> We will-- let's talk about Pepsi and Kendall Jenner when we come back.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:20.360]   But first-- first a word from Neil Sponster.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:24.080]   If you-- I want to give a plug because we have been nominated at one of Marsha's was
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.840]   nominated for a Webby Award.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.040]   I think this is the first time the Webby's have done podcasts.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:34.960]   We are nominated in the People's Choice section for a triangulation episode in which I interviewed
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.560]   Stoden's lawyer and Carson Bondi's ex-room mate.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.280]   So Carson, if we get the award, you're going to have to come up on stage with me and explain
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.480]   how we got that interview.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:49.920]   Anyway, if you-- we'd appreciate your vote if you go to twit.to/webbyz2017, you can cast
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.920]   your vote.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920]   You'd have to log in.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.640]   I think that's how they're trying to reduce the multiple vote situation.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:59.680]   But you can do it with Facebook and Twitter as well as your own email address or a spoof
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.280]   email address if you want to do that.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.920]   We had a great week this week, a lot of fun, and I think we've made a little movie for
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:10.280]   you to watch that synopsizes some of the hilarity that ensued watching.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.120]   >> Previously on Twit.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:17.240]   When using the word awkward in a sentence, the enhanced male and female theory voices
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.120]   say the word normally.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:23.680]   When using the word by itself, though, it's, well, awkward.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.520]   >> This week in Google.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.400]   >> YouTube TV was announced about a month ago and it has launched today in five American
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.400]   cities.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.640]   >> You know, when Steve Jobs said I've looked TV, it's, you know, this is what I would've
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   imagined Apple would've done.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.640]   >> And Apple is--
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   >> This is what he would've looked.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:45.120]   >> One of the things it's going to do is finally turn phones into a legitimate and widespread
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.320]   medium for live TV.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.880]   >> Matt, break weekly.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.600]   >> Apple has updated the Matt Pro.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:58.440]   They had a journalist come to Cupertino and had a roundtable where they explain why this
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.280]   is the best they could do right now.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:04.320]   >> I think that they were going one direction and realized that that one direction might
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.320]   have been--
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.360]   >> It started today.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.640]   It would take you to next year to come up with a redesign, Matt Pro.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   >> I call BS.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.160]   I don't buy any of this.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.840]   This is trying to keep those people who are about to leave the fold in suspended animation
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.080]   for another year.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.080]   >> To it.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.400]   It's like tech TV without the overpriced cable bill.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.880]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.760]   >> Meghan Moroni has a look at the week ahead.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.720]   >> Here's a look at the week ahead.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.520]   >> Those 10 creators edition will begin to roll out to users this week on April 11th
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.040]   as a free update.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:43.080]   Also on April 11th, AMD will start shipping the Ryzen 5 desktop processors, which they
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.360]   will sell for less than $250.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:51.240]   Benchmarks of the chips have already leaked online, so if you are an eager gamer or creator,
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.360]   you can take a look right now.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:15:00.520]   And April 12th is the world space party, also known as Yuri's Night, named after Yuri Gagarin,
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:04.800]   the first human in space on April 12th, 1961.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.960]   Then on April 14th, the new FAA airspace restrictions against drones go into effect,
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:16.240]   officially banning them from unauthorized operations over 133 military facilities.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.560]   And in the United States this week, on April 15th, it's tax day, which falls on a Saturday
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560]   this year.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.480]   As the deadline approaches, so do the scammers.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.200]   Remember that the IRS will not email you asking for your social security number.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.800]   As the IRS assured, they already know it.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.480]   Those are just some of the stories that Jason Howell and I will be following this week on
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.040]   Tech News Today.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.760]   >> Actually, I've got a great story about the IRS.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:50.480]   Apparently, they had a system called FAFSA that was used by lots of millions of people
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.360]   to figure out what kind of financial aid they could get for college.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.400]   The IRS knew that that had been compromised or was compromiseable.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.400]   >> No, that's a few.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.960]   >> Oh, stop it.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:06.400]   It was compromiseable in October, but they said, "Well, so many people use it.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   It's such a convenience.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.640]   We're just going to keep it running for a while."
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   What?
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:16.480]   They finally shut it down in February after they witnessed a pattern of fraudulent activity.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480]   What a shock.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.880]   Actually, they shut it down in March.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.120]   What a shock.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:25.880]   And now they're emailing 100,000 people saying, "Yeah, so what the deal was you could go on
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.800]   this site, free application for federal student aid."
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.640]   It would retrieve your tax information for you.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.880]   >> So, hackers just said, "Oh, good."
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.080]   And just would start putting in names and get their tax records.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:44.720]   Now, get ready because at least 100,000 people started the application, used the data retrieval
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.040]   tool and then finished it and the IRS thinks, "Hmm, maybe those were hackers."
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:52.920]   So they're alerting all of those people saying, "Your data might have been compromised.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.920]   And what should you do?"
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:59.000]   Well, you might want to check to see if somebody else claimed your refund.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   You know, before you did.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.280]   >> Oh, and I imagine the IRS will cut through that red tape real quick.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.280]   Like, "Oh, yeah, no problem.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.280]   We'll give you the refund."
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:10.560]   >> The IRS has a record of being very, very poor.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.560]   >> Cavalier.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.480]   But it's the logical place.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.480]   The old quote, bang bang.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.480]   >> That's where the money is.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.080]   >> Yeah, why you rob bank because that's where the money is.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   Same with the IRS.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.080]   >> That's ridiculous.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080]   >> And they've had this.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.560]   They've had the pin number scandal last year.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.560]   >> Oh my God.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.680]   >> I mean, they really are just playing in the dark here going, "Well, the good news is
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:31.880]   that President Trump apparently is going to reduce their budget significantly, so they'll
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.880]   get better."
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.520]   >> No, no, no, they'll get bigly better.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.520]   >> Bigly.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.520]   >> Wow.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:44.960]   So anyway, 15 million people use that system to figure out what financially they can get.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.600]   Even though they knew it could be abused, they kept it online for an extra six months
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.440]   to make sure hackers got the opportunity they needed.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:56.960]   >> It's kind of the hacker scholarship fund is what that is.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.760]   >> So, yeah, be careful.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.960]   This is a bad time of year.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.800]   This is when people will take advantage of you.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.360]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks when it comes tax time.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.160]   If you signed up, if you heard our ads a year ago and signed up for FreshBooks, you're
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.360]   sitting pretty.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:16.680]   If you haven't signed up yet, you may want to think about it for next year's tax time.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   What is FreshBooks?
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:24.440]   It's the online, ridiculously easy to use online accounting software used now by 10 million
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.640]   small business owners.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.720]   I was one of their first customers back in 2004.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.520]   I used it because I hated invoicing.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.520]   If you're a freelancer, you have to send out invoices.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.480]   It's the worst thing ever.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.680]   >> Well, I'm getting them paid off.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:37.680]   That's the problem, right?
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.840]   So if you don't send an invoice, it turns out I learned you don't get paid.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:47.160]   Well, if you use FreshBooks, A, it's easy to create the invoice, 30 seconds or less,
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.960]   and it's a professional looking invoice.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.080]   And this is the thing I like the most.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:56.680]   On average, FreshBooks users get paid 11 days faster.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.640]   You're going to get paid faster because when your client gets that invoice, there's a
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.320]   pay me button on it.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.840]   You can let your clients pay online via credit card.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.520]   There's no setup required.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.840]   Your customer can pay straight from the invoice.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.200]   It turns out clients, eight paperwork as much as you do, they put off paying the bills
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.280]   as much as you put off sending the bills.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.200]   If they can pay faster, they will.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.760]   It's good for everyone.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.440]   You can always see with FreshBooks dashboard which invoices have been sent, which ones
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:25.080]   have been paid, even which ones have been viewed.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.080]   So no more excuses.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.080]   I didn't get your invoice.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.080]   Yes, you did.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.240]   Yes, you did.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.840]   You can send auto payment reminders.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.720]   You can set automatic late fees.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.680]   FreshBooks lets you track billing for time and hours, and it'll automatically put it
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.240]   right in the invoice.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.240]   You can even set it up by a specific project as well as by client.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.920]   You can track your time down to the minute on their app or on their website.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.040]   You can manage team time sheets this way.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.600]   And it is so easy.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.960]   The best part, this new dashboard that just redesigned it tells you if you're making money
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.760]   or not, something that a lot of small business, I didn't know.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.880]   Am I making money when you add in all the invoices plus what I got paid, what I didn't
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.040]   get paid, what my expenses were?
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.400]   Did I make money this year?
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   You'll know.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:12.200]   And when it comes to tax time, all the reports your accountant needs like sales tax, summary,
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.840]   and profit and loss are available.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.440]   You don't have to be an accountant to use it though.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.560]   It's really straightforward.
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.320]   It's kind of like behind the scenes accounting.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.520]   It does it all for you.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:26.760]   It integrates with many of the apps you probably use like Shopify and Stripe and Gusto, Acuity,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:31.360]   Scheduling, all the Expensing, like CUR and Expensify.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.280]   It's just sweet.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.960]   Ensure a smooth tax season next year anyway.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:41.760]   And by the way, save on average 192 hours a year with FreshBooks.

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.480]   Just put this week in tech.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.000]   And how did you hear about this section?
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.760]   This week in tech, freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.040]   We thank him for their support.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.480]   I didn't know about Yuri's night.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.000]   That's kind of cool to celebrate.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.920]   And we've got the March of Science on April 22nd as well.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.920]   What's that?
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.920]   The March of Science?
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.440]   Scientists around the country are going to be marching to protect science.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.440]   Science, scientific independence.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.440]   Let's protect science.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.440]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.280]   You've got us a fair way of viewing this now, thanks to it.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.280]   So, you know, it's just--
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.720]   Well, yeah, I always make that point.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.200]   And people say, well, technology's not science.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.120]   It's applied science.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.960]   If we didn't have science, we wouldn't have technology.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.160]   Exactly.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:24.360]   I mean, when the electron was discovered, it was totally useless.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.040]   It didn't take a while until we worked out.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.720]   I had to put it into electronics.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.560]   And it took a little bit longer for Pepsi to make the Kenner--
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560]   Oh.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.560]   Oh.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.040]   So--
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040]   [GRUNTING]
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.600]   This is your favorite story of the week?
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.600]   Well, why don't you tell it then?
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:40.600]   Absolutely.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.440]   OK, we're going to even start.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:51.400]   So, Pepsi thought that they had this great woke ad starring Kendall Jenner.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.400]   It's just backfired in the most spectacular way that an advertisement could ever backfire,
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.400]   I guess.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.600]   We can run through the ad a little bit.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]   It's really--
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.600]   It's painfully cringe-worthy.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.600]   I have to buy my first-old-best one.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.600]   It's so cringe-worthy.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.600]   It's part of the conversation.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.600]   Pepsi-worthy.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:08.600]   And Pepsi-worthy.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.600]   Yeah, that's the protest.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.400]   It's not-- well, so Kendall Jenner, it starts off with a guy playing fiddle on the roof.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   I don't know why.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.400]   Oh, he'll appear--
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.400]   It's a cello.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.320]   He'll appear later in the thing.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.480]   This is the protest, which is the mildest all-white protest you've ever-- oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.880]   There's a mixed race.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.040]   And the sign say, "Join the conversation and peace signs."
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.720]   And that's because, Cesscie, didn't want to be controversial.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:35.040]   Right, because because every protest says, "Join the conversation."
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.040]   Join the conversation.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:41.800]   People modeling a metal bikini shirt or something, I don't know what the hell-- or dress.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.400]   And then they have a woman in a hijab who's drawing something.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.400]   And then--
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.400]   She's a photographer.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.160]   She's just trying to find the perfect shot.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.040]   And she suddenly then hears the process outdoors and goes, "You know what?
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.040]   I'm going to take photos of the protest."
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.840]   Ironically, so does the cellist who's been drinking Pepsi.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.840]   Yes.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.840]   Of coincidence, I think not.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.840]   Coincidence, everyone's drinking Pepsi.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.080]   Everybody is, including everybody, including Kendall Jenner.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.440]   So Kendall-- oh, this photographer's very upset.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.080]   She just can't get the right shot.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080]   Oh, good.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.080]   But now she's moved.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.360]   I'm going to join the protest.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.080]   Maybe I'm going to grab my camera and get this great shot.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.080]   Good.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.080]   And she's taking pictures.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080]   And there's the guy with the cello.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   Here's a drummer.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.080]   No, no, no, no.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.080]   We don't know why the drummer's there.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.080]   Pepsi Blue.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.680]   Note the Pepsi Blue on the cello case.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.680]   Ah, yes.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.680]   There's some happy people.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.680]   That's a nice touch.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:30.680]   Break dancing.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.680]   You see, all the people are getting together.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:32.680]   Oh, good.
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.680]   The cultural culture.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.680]   Multiturcing the conversation.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.480]   And all of a sudden, Kendall's made aware.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.880]   Look, she's the hero of noise.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.880]   Who is Kendall Jenner?
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:40.880]   Is she famous?
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.880]   Yes.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:42.880]   OK.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:43.880]   She's very famous.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:44.880]   She's famous for being famous.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:45.880]   One of those, right?
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.880]   Well, she's famous because her older sister is famous.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:48.880]   She's a jellyfish.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.880]   She's a jellyfish.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:50.880]   She's being related to the famous.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:51.880]   So she takes off her blonde wig.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   So she takes off her wig.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.880]   White's off her lipstick.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:54.880]   And makes me like the white's the white's the white's.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:11.080]   She's a population.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.280]   And then all of a sudden, here's the shot.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.280]   Here's the money shot.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:18.280]   Kendall gives a police officer a Pepsi.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.880]   And then all of a sudden, that's the shot.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   I got the shot.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.880]   And then all of a sudden, she's smiling and everybody's cheers.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.160]   And you know what?
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160]   We are now all united.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:31.080]   Honestly, you try that in a London protest and the metal.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.680]   Are you picking your teeth up off the pavement within seconds?
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.880]   So you try that in New York, you're going to get tased.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:41.000]   So look, first of all, there's not been a soda pop commercial ever that wasn't stupid
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   and insipid.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   Right?
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   You're dead on.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   Absolutely.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   So this is nothing new.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.440]   Well, but this is a different type of stupid and insipid.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.440]   How so?
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.080]   This is trying to, as I said, this is trying to be woke.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.640]   What's amazing about this is that most of the time there's at least a little bit of
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.800]   self-awareness.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   It's a pop star.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.800]   It's a model.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.320]   I'd like to teach the world to sing.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.320]   Exactly.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.320]   Perfect harmony.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:10.440]   I'd like to buy the world a Coke and keep it company.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:17.760]   Now, that's an example of using kind of hippies and Earth Day to sell soda pop sugar.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:23.280]   What they were doing here was taking iconography from Ferguson and from a bunch of other
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.280]   protests.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.080]   See, I'm having a hard time being offended by this ad.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.920]   It's stupid as all ads are.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.920]   It's offensively stupid.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.000]   Well, it's offensive to say to say to, okay, when police brutality is a very real thing.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.080]   And when protesters in the United States and around the world are actually facing off
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080]   and are at risk.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.440]   And I'm getting killed.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.840]   And are getting killed exactly when people are getting tased, when we have that iconic
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:51.800]   photograph last year of the woman in the dress who was being handcuffed for simply walking
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   up to the cops.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.360]   When you have that sort of iconic imagery, and this is actually happening, and instead
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.840]   you say, well, the way we can bring us all together is to hand someone a soda.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.640]   To me, that's offensive on a different level.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.440]   And it's not even offensive so much.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.440]   It's tone deaf.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.240]   And to think that this is something that would relate to a millennial audience, to
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.480]   relate to the Kendall Jenner's demographic, the people would be applauding this.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:22.400]   And instead, it just comes across as so tone deaf and so completely out of touch.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.840]   So Pepsi pulled it right away.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840]   They got a lot of airplay.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   They didn't say it.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.840]   They initially defended it.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.760]   At first, they said it was an serious statement.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.400]   And Kendall said she was proud to be part of this meaningful thing.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.560]   And then the last point was when they didn't figure out that all the people who thought
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.600]   it was stupid were right.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.880]   Well, the classic tweet came from Martin Luther King's daughter who tweeted out a picture
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.240]   of the police holding him back going, damn, if only dad had a Pepsi.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:52.320]   It was just that that does the low point.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:56.200]   Also the low point to me was when they didn't then finally pulled the ad.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:00.080]   They apologized for the ad, but then they apologized to Kendall Jenner for putting her
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.120]   in this position because it's really that's what this is about.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.640]   It's not about, you know, I have to say, so why take on this, which I got a lot of heat
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.640]   for on Twitter.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:14.240]   What a surprise on Wednesday was, well, this is a stupid advertisement.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.440]   If you started protesting every stupid advertisement, you never end.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:24.920]   And in fact that this is a, I'm, I'm my opinion, this is a comp, a very predictable Twitter
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:30.120]   outrage protest, not a real protest, but just a bunch of people tweeting 140 characters
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:36.600]   of outrage and why the media pays any attention to outrage on Twitter anymore is beyond me.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.320]   And yeah, maybe it's, it's stupid and dumb, but tell me a soda ad that's not stupid and
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   dumb.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.800]   I think it's not overtly racist.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   It's not overtly.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   I wouldn't say that.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.440]   It's massively distasteful, but is it massively distasteful?
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.440]   It's massively distasteful.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.440]   Yes.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.800]   I mean, if you've been on protests and you've, and you've seen the kind of violence that
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.560]   goes on on both sides of the equation there, the idea that getting a kind of so making
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.480]   a light is making like a protest is the bad thing here.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.280]   Well, it's not even, but to me, the offensive part is it isn't just that they're making
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.280]   light of the protest.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.560]   It's that they're fundamentally misunderstanding what a protest is by trying to piggyback on
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560]   a movement.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.880]   Yeah, but I mean, it was a dope.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.520]   No, they didn't piggyback on a movement.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:20.560]   It said the movement was join the conversation.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.200]   They didn't say, now if they had signs to say black lives matter, I'd be upset.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.560]   But the whole point of this is the only reason we are talking about protesting.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.080]   The only reason this is even in the lexicon is because of the resistance, it's because
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.840]   of black lives matters because of the protests that have been happening over the last few
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:37.840]   years.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.400]   That's the only reason it's even relevant to this demographic they're trying to go over.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:45.280]   So to me, they are absolutely taking iconography and they're taking current events.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.080]   They're trying to piggyback on those things and pretending to be woke, pretending to be
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.040]   aware of what's happening.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:56.280]   And rather than actually making a statement of any sorts that is supporting of things,
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.240]   they are making the most innocuous and-
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.200]   Yes, as every ad ever.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.400]   As long as nobody has to think.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.840]   Honestly, I wish Morants were cold out on it.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.320]   This was a particularly egregious example.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.320]   Great.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:11.160]   I just feel like there's so much more to be worried about in this world than that stupid
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.160]   Pepsi ad.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.160]   Well, you're not wrong.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.280]   Of course, there's more to be worried about, but that doesn't mean that when we see this
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.000]   sort of thing and when it's being touted and bragged about it and that everybody who's
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.480]   involved with it is spreading, "Oh, look at this wonderful message of hope and unity."
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.040]   Well, it's not a message of hope and unity.
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.040]   You got it wrong.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   Look at this wonderful message.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.560]   No, that's exactly what the Pepsi said.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.400]   It's Pepsi saying it, but nobody at home watching this says, "Oh, thank God, the world's a better
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.400]   place now.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.400]   I can go home and stop worrying."
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.400]   Nobody's saying that.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.760]   It's a dumb, freaking ad.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:44.400]   It doesn't make me feel any better about the world than it does a dog catching Fritos
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.240]   on his nose.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.240]   It's stupid.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.240]   All ads are.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.240]   I don't understand.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.240]   Okay, I'm a-
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.240]   Honestly.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240]   I think you're an older white man.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240]   I don't get the upset.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:56.080]   I think one of the problems was that they actually came in.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:01.040]   They introduced this ad and they splurged it major style on social media with, "This
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.040]   is an important statement.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.400]   This is how we say, mend the nation."
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.400]   I miss that.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:10.040]   If you do that, then you do deserve all the Twitter outrage you can get.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.040]   That's exactly what's going on.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.040]   That I understand.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.800]   If they just ran it on TV and they didn't try to do a social media.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.800]   No, no, no.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:16.800]   They went for social media.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.800]   Leo, why did they get Kendall Jenner to be part of this?
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   I have no idea.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.280]   She doesn't move me either.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.120]   Okay, well, because it wouldn't move you, but she has a huge following on social media.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.040]   She's hugely relevant with a certain demographic and certain audience.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:33.120]   The fact is this was a very calculated ad as Ian was saying, to go after a certain thing
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.360]   and to show us, "Oh, look at how evolved we are.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.640]   Look at how enlightened we are."
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.920]   Then they got it wrong.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.000]   That's why everyone responded after the big social media push.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000]   The response was, "No."
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.400]   I missed that part where they were doing that.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.400]   That's reprehensible.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.280]   I don't think they're making it.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.120]   Now here's Saturday Night Live's take on this.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.120]   Do you have my audience?
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.120]   I haven't seen this one yet.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.120]   Okay.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.280]   It starts with people with Pepsi.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:58.640]   It starts actually with the filming of the love march.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.640]   You're not the common rehearsal.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.440]   Let's be ready to roll at five.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.440]   Thank you.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.240]   How's it going, Mr. Director?
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.240]   Good.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.240]   Good.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.240]   I'm really excited.
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.600]   You know, he should be writing and directing a commercial for Pepsi.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.040]   He doesn't get much bigger than that.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.440]   Oh, hey, this is my sister.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.720]   I got to get this real quick.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.520]   Carrie, hey, sorry.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.680]   I can't super talk right now.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.480]   I'm on the set of this huge Pepsi commercial I'm doing.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.480]   I know, right?
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:25.120]   It was like completely my idea and now they're doing it.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.120]   It's great.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.720]   I mean, okay, so well, it's an homage to the resistance.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.920]   There's this huge protest in the street reminiscent of Black Lives Matter.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:34.920]   And so everybody's marching.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.520]   So if there was a guy who said all that, I would be upset.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.440]   And I think it's going to go bad because there's kind of like a standoff.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:45.240]   And then Kendall Jenner walks in and she walks up to one of the police officers and
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.800]   she hands him a Pepsi.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.440]   And then that Pepsi brings everybody together.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:54.560]   Isn't that like the best dad ever?
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:04.080]   His face is falling as his sister reads in the riot act.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.720]   Apparently, that's your brother, Christina.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:08.720]   Oh, no.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.720]   He's getting sure it's turned up.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:14.720]   All right, guys.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.720]   Three minutes away.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.720]   Three minutes.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:17.720]   He's just being sure it's turned up.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.720]   He says, I just don't get it.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.720]   Is Doug there?
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.720]   Can you put him on?
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.720]   Thank you for asking.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.720]   What's up?
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.680]   Hey, I just want to run this Pepsi commercial by you that I'm doing.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:28.200]   Make sure you're loving it as much as I am.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.120]   The whole thing is sort of an homage to the resistance Black Lives Matter.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.480]   So everybody's marching.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:36.240]   And then Kendall Jenner comes up to a police officer and gives him a Pepsi.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.240]   Everybody celebrates.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.120]   People of every single culture come to get--
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.120]   Uh-huh.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:41.120]   Even the brothers in law--
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.120]   You're celebrating these cultures.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:49.520]   We're celebrating Black culture.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:56.520]   We're celebrating Asian culture.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.520]   [CHEERING]
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.520]   Yeah, we're celebrating Asian Chellists.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   We're celebrating Asian culture.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.520]   [CHEERING]
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.520]   Yeah, we're celebrating Asian Chellists.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.520]   We're celebrating Asian Chellists.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   Because as you know, all Asians are great.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520]   Oh, and mathematicians are cool.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.520]   Yeah, they're great.
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.520]   [CHEERING]
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.520]   Just a couple of discussion, and I'll put this together so quickly.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:11.520]   I have to.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:13.520]   This is very well done, huh?
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.520]   There's the girl in her job.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.520]   It's going to be bad.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.520]   All right, people, 60 seconds till we roll on this mess.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.520]   All right, people, on this man's singular vision.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:25.520]   Hey, man, could you maybe put a neighbor on the phone?
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.520]   The poor guy just--
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.520]   He's just trying to get some affirmation.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.520]   I'm sure it goes on more than saying.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.520]   But I think the problem is that somebody actually did have that discussion.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:36.520]   Exactly.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:37.520]   And now, I've been woke.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.520]   I've been woke.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.520]   Saturday at Live woke me and Christina Warren, and all right, I get it.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.520]   Perhaps they drank its own Kool-Aid, so to speak.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.520]   It's so funny because I genuinely think that his first explanation in that SNL sketch when
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.520]   they talked about those things--
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:53.520]   It's probably exactly the conversation.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.520]   That's exactly what happened in the meeting.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.520]   And unfortunately, there wasn't anybody who was able to-- on the outside from whatever agency
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.520]   they used to say.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:05.520]   You guys, maybe this isn't a great idea.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.520]   Or--
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.520]   Okay, you want a conspiracy theory?
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.520]   Sure.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.520]   Or they said, wait till they see this on Twitter.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.520]   Just imagine the talk, the conversation.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.520]   Maybe Leo will even play the ad on Twitter.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.520]   Right.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.520]   No such thing as bad publicity.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.520]   I would agree with that conspiracy theory.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.520]   Again, if they hadn't had to apologize to Kendall Jenner, which is my favorite part because I
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.520]   love to imagine that Christian or her mother, her momager.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.520]   I love to imagine that Christian or read the riot act to the Pepsi executives who then had
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.520]   the fear of God put into them.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.520]   And so they were okay with the Twitter backlash.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.520]   It was the Kardashian backlash.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:45.520]   They were like, oh no, we cannot take the Christian or coming after us.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.520]   Am I wrong though?
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:51.520]   I really feel like-- look, I'm not one of those people who say, oh, it's all this political
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.520]   correctness.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:57.280]   I understand that that is code saying, you know, I want to be able to be as racist and offensive
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.280]   as I want.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.520]   And why are you saying I'm offensive?
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.520]   So I understand that.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:08.520]   But I don't-- I think you can also go too far the other way with microaggressions and Twitter
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.520]   outrage.
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.520]   And sometimes I worry that, you know, we-- before the show, I was celebrating Tom Layers' birthday.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.520]   Right?
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.520]   Oh.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.520]   And he has a great song called the Vatican Rag, which is funny.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.520]   It says, if the Vatican liturgy were set to ragtime music, it's not offensive.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:27.160]   But immediately somebody said, this is Palm Sunday.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.640]   How dare you air that?
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.640]   Oh, for me.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.520]   And I do feel like we live in a world where a lot of this stuff-- and maybe, again, this
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.520]   is just me being an old guy.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.520]   No.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:37.520]   I-- I'm going to say--
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:38.520]   You're old too.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.520]   You don't get to say it.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.520]   Oh, well, thanks very much.
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:48.520]   But I used a metaphor in a story where I basically said Microsoft takes a service out behind the
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:51.200]   head and ship-- behind the shed and shoots it.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:55.520]   And I got outrage from some people to say, how dare you use a gun metaphor?
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.520]   You're encouraging--
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.520]   You did give me a trigger warning, right?
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.520]   Well, also trigger warning.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.520]   Hang on a second.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:03.520]   If you're a victim of a firearms incident, how does that work exactly?
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.520]   Well, I want to be sensitive.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.520]   I really do want to be sensitive.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:10.120]   But at the same time, I don't want-- I think we can be oversensitive and walk on eggshells.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.720]   And that doesn't help the conversation either.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:15.120]   At the end of that, you put a tool in this crap out.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.120]   Right.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.120]   Pepsi is in the arena.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.120]   They put this thing out, wanting to get a reaction.
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:23.960]   And so it's not wrong to react to it, even if it's diametrically opposed to what they
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:24.960]   wanted.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:28.680]   Also, I think that at least-- I mean, maybe I saw a different person Twitter than you
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:29.680]   did Leo.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.360]   But most of the reaction I saw was obviously was making fun of how tone deaf it was.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:38.520]   It wasn't an outrage of how dare of Pepsi be-- it wasn't going over the top of people
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.760]   feeling overly vilified.
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:45.440]   It was just acknowledgment, kind of like the SNL thing was acknowledgment of what a dumb,
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.560]   stupid ad this was and how completely off-paced this was.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.400]   I didn't see a lot of serious-- I mean, there were obviously some serious critiques of what
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.400]   was wrong with it.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:54.400]   But most of it's time to almost be--
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.400]   What were they thinking?
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.400]   Exactly.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:58.400]   That was the reaction.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:03.000]   I mean, my reaction and why I love this story so much was like, how does this ever get-- how
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.520]   do you ever think that this is going to be something that will play well?
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.360]   Like in what universe do you think this is a good idea?
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.480]   Not how dare they do this insensitive thing.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:16.200]   I think most of the reaction was what were they thinking.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.280]   I agree with what were they thinking.
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.680]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.720]   And I've spent my time in protests.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:25.280]   I'm not-- we don't apparently have the violent protests you have in the UK.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:29.200]   Well, OK, you tend to shoot people here more than the UK protests.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.680]   But on the other hand, if going up again, it's a quick death, rather, if you get a couple
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.680]   of metropolitan police people driving you out and then--
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.280]   I've faced down the tax squad a few times.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.600]   Yeah, well, when you've had all four of the people dying in police custody in the UK,
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:45.160]   it used to be the old joke that how many policemen to take to break a light bulb.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160]   It's none.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160]   It fell down the stairs by itself.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:53.240]   So we just rough our people up a bit, though, whereas over here.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.240]   All right.
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.240]   I'm going to take a break and we'll do a good news segment when we come back.
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.240]   Sweet.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.240]   Happy stuff.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240]   Really happy stuff.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240]   But first, let me mention rocket mortgage.
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.240]   I'm happy about rocket mortgage.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.360]   Last time when we bought our house, it took a month to get a mortgage.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:08.760]   And they kept coming back to us and want more documents.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.160]   It just drives me crazy.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:13.840]   If you're about to buy a house or you're about to refi, you should know about quick
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.040]   and loans, the best mortgage lender in the country.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.960]   I'll say that without fear of contradiction, these guys are amazing.
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:20.960]   They're awesome.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.840]   Look at all those JD Power customer satisfaction awards, number one, year after year after year.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.240]   They're also geeks.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.760]   They're also very high tech.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:32.560]   Maybe you've heard the stories about how they're rebuilding downtown Detroit and they're bringing
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.680]   it's really a neat company.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:38.480]   And they decided that geeks deserve a better loan approval process.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.240]   So they created something they call a rocket mortgage because it's fast.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.440]   It lifts you up, lifts the burden of getting a home loan.
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.040]   Well, it's all online.
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.200]   That's the real key.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.200]   And it's fast.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.640]   I mean, a month to get a loan, we're talking minutes here.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:59.720]   So if you go to quickandloans.com/twit2, that's the new URL, quickandloans.com/twit
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.240]   and the number two, you'll see rocket mortgage.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:09.320]   You can literally, you could be at an open house and say, "I want to buy a house, submit
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:10.320]   every bit of paperwork.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.680]   You don't have to go through boxes of papers."
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:17.000]   Just whatever paperwork they need, which is probably pay stubs and check statements,
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.400]   that kind of thing, you do that all online.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:23.080]   You can adjust the rate and the length of the loan in real time.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.160]   You can adjust the way you want it.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:29.280]   And then within minutes, get approved for a loan that's exactly right for you.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.080]   So you're looking to buy or refi.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:35.760]   This is the way to skip the bank, skip the waiting, go completely online.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:41.440]   Quickandloans.com/twit2, it's rocket mortgage, equal housing, lender, licensed in all 50
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:48.720]   states, nmlsconsumeraccess.org, number 30, 30, rocket mortgage, quickandloans.com/twit
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:52.920]   and the number two.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.560]   And we thank them for their support.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:01.640]   I do have to say that I have never liked that all the ads we do, there's no Kendall Jenner
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:03.600]   in our ads, right?
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:08.200]   All the ads we do, and of course, we wouldn't be good for Pepsi probably, are about features
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.200]   and benefits.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.480]   In every single case, that's what we try to do.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:16.240]   And when I tell our advertisers, "Look, we're going to make an introduction and I need to
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.760]   tell my audience this is what it is, this is how it works, this is what you'd get, and
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.680]   here's how you could try it."
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.920]   And that to me is a much more ethical relationship between an advertiser and a prospective customer
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:29.600]   than Jeff.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.920]   But that doesn't work for us.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.720]   So what's the feature in benefit of Pepsi?
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:40.560]   Well, it's sweet, it's got a lot of sugar in it, carbonated, it's fizzy.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.600]   They have to do things like it, it makes the world a better place because it doesn't,
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:50.400]   it just rots your teeth and your stomach lining and it makes you fat, but they can't tell
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.400]   people that.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:56.680]   Everybody puts that stuff in whiskey needs to be shot.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:03.320]   Good news, Jeff Bezos selling $1 billion of Amazon stock a year wide to fund Blue Origin,
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:07.600]   his civilian space venture.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:12.280]   Jeff is now the richest, is he the richest, the second richest man in the world after Warren
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.280]   Buffett?
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.360]   No, after Bill Gates.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:15.360]   After Bill Gates.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.360]   Yeah, Warren Slid down.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:17.360]   Warren Slid down.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.360]   Yeah, Warren Slid down.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.160]   Bill's still number one.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.560]   Bill has, well, Jeff has I think $45 billion net worth.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560]   $45.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.840]   And it's gone up significant, I can't remember the exact amount, but it's gone up a huge amount
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:30.840]   in the last year.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.600]   Like he's really increases net worth.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.440]   So he's not like SpaceX.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:42.800]   SpaceX seems like, you know, Elon wants to colonize Mars, you know, capture asterisk.
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:45.800]   Jeff is just trying to get together 11 minute rides in space.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:51.240]   Well, you see, this is the difference in business plan in the, yeah, I mean, Jeff will say,
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:52.960]   well, we landed our rocket first.
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:56.280]   It's just, yeah, you send it straight up, hover it, send it straight down again.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:01.440]   Do not do a full orbital delivery, turn the thing round, re-burn it, get it back down.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:06.000]   And by the way, who does SpaceX, which for the first time has reused one of those last
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000]   week.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.440]   And that was really cool, cool, cool.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:13.600]   But at the same time, Blue Origin has got into the deal of making engines.
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.760]   I think that they announced this this week, they're going to be making engines for United
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:21.680]   launch alliance who are SpaceX's main competitor and have been relying on Russian engines up
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:22.880]   until now.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.520]   So he needs to really expand his rocketry business so he can meet ULA's demands and he
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:33.000]   wants to adapt the new Shepard spacecraft with a second stage so it can actually deliver
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.960]   something useful into orbit rather than just thrill seekers with too much money.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.680]   So the first, the beginning of this is to, is the amusement park rock basically.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:44.600]   But there's a long-term strategy that is more useful.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:49.400]   Yeah, I mean, his initial funding proposition was you send people up above the, I think
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.520]   it's the 73 mile limit which officially makes them astronaut, they hover there for a few
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:55.520]   minutes, they float around.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.520]   I would do that.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:59.680]   Yeah, but I mean, then they'll come down and say, well, I'm an astronaut, it's like,
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.680]   no, you're not.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.680]   I'm a brief visit in there.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.840]   And if you want to go experience zero G, there's vomit comets all around California.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.480]   But that's not real zero G, that's just, you know.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:11.520]   It's exactly the same G that you get in the, in the social space station.
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.520]   Yeah, but I want to be in space.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:15.400]   I want to be 11 miles above the earth.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.560]   Well, yeah, there is that.
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.640]   You do get the view.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:23.120]   But, you know, long term, he wants to develop blue origins into an orbital delivery service.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.120]   Okay, that's fair.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.800]   And the ULA contract and putting a second stage on the Uchepp would, we'll do that.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.200]   But that requires a lot of money.
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.600]   It's like Amazon starting out selling books.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.600]   Exactly.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:38.680]   Yeah, I would never, I would never sell Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos short.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.480]   Both of them are very lucky to live in a time with these.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:43.440]   These guys are around.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:47.560]   By the way, I underestimated Bezos is net worth by a little bit.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:53.360]   He's 75 billion, 78 billion Forbes, a billion dollars.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.360]   What's bill worth?
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.920]   I think he's actually full now, isn't he?
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.920]   Holy cow.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:03.280]   That's an unimaginable wealth, but credit to bill who's donating that all to charity,
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.280]   right?
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:08.040]   Mark Zuckerberg is going to do 90% or something like that.
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:12.400]   Well, he's putting into a family foundation, which isn't necessarily a charity, which is
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.360]   kind of different and a really good way to hang out.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.360]   Exactly.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.560]   He's buying eight foot pictures of himself to hang in the lot.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:20.680]   No, I mean, he's buying the four houses around his house in San Francisco because he
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.680]   likes his privacy.
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.040]   Is that, wait a minute, is the foundation buying those houses?
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.040]   No, no, he bought them beforehand.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.600]   But the foundation isn't technically a charity.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.720]   It is actually a, it's not a non-profit.
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.320]   It's something slightly different.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.320]   Well, we'll see.
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:37.560]   If he wants to run for president, he better get his chair to, oh no, never mind that doesn't
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.760]   matter, does it?
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.760]   Jeff Bezos, good man.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.840]   So that's one happy story.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.720]   I promised you some happy stories here.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.880]   This is always hard.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:54.120]   I've got to say that Bezos actually, when he was speaking at the space conference, he's
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:58.480]   really getting the butch, you know, blue origin leather jacket thing down and he's got some
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:44:59.960]   swagger into him, which is nice to see.
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.800]   He's starting to look like a character at our Westworld.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.800]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.200]   Well, you know what I'm saying?
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.200]   A little bit.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:06.200]   We're not that far away.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:11.820]   This book, Mozilla and Craig Newmark of Craigslist have launched a 14, this is the other good
[01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:13.020]   news, 14, I think.
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.520]   I don't know, maybe not.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.760]   I bet you could piss on this one too.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.920]   You're good at that.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:18.920]   I see.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.800]   $14 million fund to support news integrity.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.120]   What do you have against news integrity?
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.560]   I have nothing at all against news integrity.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:29.120]   I've got a, this is, I mean, okay, Mozilla involved.
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:31.720]   Craig Newmark has put a fat chunk of his own page.
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.720]   He's quite a philanthropist.
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:36.040]   14 million, I mean, the donation from Facebook.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.120]   I mean, Zuckerberg could find that down the back of his cycle.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.120]   Well, maybe they will.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.480]   By the way, our own Jeff Jarvis is one of the people who will be involved in this CUNY's
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.600]   Graduate School of Journalism will administer the project.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:54.040]   They also have donations from Ford Foundation, the Democracy Fund, the TOW Foundation, AppNexus,
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.040]   Beto Works.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.240]   So, so there's a lot of money in this.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.680]   What are they going to do though?
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.560]   I'm clear so far as, I know.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:06.240]   Well, we'll ask Jeff on Wednesday when he comes in.
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.240]   They are, they are funding projects, I guess.
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.080]   Yeah, I mean, we need this kind of stuff, but at the same time for Facebook to turn around
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.720]   three years ago and say, we want to be the front page of the internet.
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.200]   And then when it gets swamped out with fake rubbish from all over the world, they say,
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.760]   well, we're just a media platform.
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:23.040]   It's not our responsibility.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:26.000]   And then just a chunk, such a paltry amount of money into it.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000]   Have I pissed on you enough?
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000]   Yes, thank you very much.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000]   I knew you would.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.440]   Conversely, though, I like the idea that I don't want Facebook being responsible all
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.160]   by itself or trying to solve this problem.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.480]   I like the idea of other organizations and smart people.
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480]   Well, that's awful.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.480]   Every single skin in the game.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.360]   Teach critical thinking in school.
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:46.120]   When I was in school, we had a module called Media Studies where you looked at how media
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:50.520]   companies got there and how program makers and filmmakers got their message across.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.760]   And you only studied it for a year, but it allowed you to actually look and say, oh,
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.760]   so that's what they're trying to do there.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:01.000]   And that's using the raised fist icon, so that shows protests and just teach kids some
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.040]   media savvy and we could solve one awful of these problems.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.040]   Google's doing it.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.840]   Well, I don't think it's the kids who are the people.
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:07.840]   Well, I see.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.840]   Yeah, it's the grandparents as well.
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.360]   It's old people like me.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:14.880]   Oh, come on, you know, old.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:15.920]   Google's starting to do this, right?
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:21.480]   With search results, they're starting to tag some search results as less and suspicious.
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:22.480]   What give me something?
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.080]   I'd search for Obama birth certificate.
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.920]   And there are a number of stories, but they do say, and I think this might be part of
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.040]   this new thing.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:37.520]   This is the Snopes article, but it says, claim claimed by fact checked false in the search
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.520]   result.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.200]   So I guess that's what we're going to start to see.
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:41.840]   What else can I, how about Sam?
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:48.040]   Yeah, the first two links that you get on that are W and D, which is about as reliable
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.480]   as I don't know, chocolate tea pot.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.440]   How about 9/11 conspiracy?
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.440]   Would that be a good one?
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:57.320]   Oh, well, I said, we all know about this.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.520]   Maybe if I write 9/11 inside job.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:03.360]   That would, that would probably turn up some.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:07.200]   Yeah, see, I don't know when Google is doing this.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.440]   Well, they're supposed to be doing it in the news results, not so much.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.440]   Ah, let's go to news.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.800]   It was supposed to be coming up in the news things.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.400]   It's where it's supposed to be coming up.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.280]   Here's vice testing out Google's new fact check.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.880]   Maybe vice figured out how to use it.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.640]   Well, and the problem is, is that the way the fact checking happens, a lot of it, the
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.760]   onus is on the fact checking organization.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:31.480]   So it's at the onus on snopes and places like that to update the way the schema.org.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.480]   Okay.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:39.040]   So that's why I saw it on a Snopes result, not on the fake news results.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:44.040]   That's why I'm seeing it on the PolitiFact result, not on the fake news sources.
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:45.800]   That is of limited value.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:47.800]   Yes.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.400]   And I think the knowledge graph little box with like the synopsis.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.840]   It is not repeating snopes and PolitiFact anyway.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:54.440]   You're not going to be duped probably.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:59.040]   I mean, it's, it's, and there's already, if you go on to something like Reddit, the Donald,
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:04.760]   they're already saying, well, slopes is clearly a democratic, Soros funded, you know, misinformation
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.760]   campaign.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.280]   It's, you know, it's a never ending thing.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.000]   And that just, this struck me very much as a PR as a PR move.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.960]   Chuck a little bit of money at it and I hope it goes away because that's what could desperately
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:16.960]   embarrass us.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.560]   I'm only, I'm only seeing it because Snopes is the number one result for a search for
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.800]   dumbest group of voters.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.800]   Right.
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:28.840]   But this is, so you wouldn't, this might be buried as it was with some of the other searches.
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:32.720]   Claim, claimed by facts, fact checked and then false.
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:35.880]   So yeah, that's not, that's not going to change.
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:40.320]   Maybe it's just a first stop though and you can certainly understand why they want to,
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.080]   instead of Google decide any what's true.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.640]   They had a problem with that, didn't they?
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:51.560]   And then I'm with the Google home saying some horrific things because they were using knowledge
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.560]   graph stuff.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:55.720]   There are some value in making this a little bit easier to find because there are people
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.800]   who won't not click through.
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:02.800]   But if they see it right there on the page, just say, wait with movie listings, you might
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.760]   not click through to fan dango, but if they're movie listings and the results are more likely
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.440]   to find them valuable.
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.840]   And some people are just like, Oh, we live in a post fact society.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:13.720]   Don't worry about it.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.600]   You know, that's what drives me absolutely insane.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:17.880]   There are such things as facts.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.040]   We should recognize that.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.040]   Right.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.040]   Right.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:22.040]   There's opinion.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.560]   Sometimes people conflate opinion with facts.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.680]   My opinion is factual, however.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:34.520]   Ev Williams, the founder of Twitter is selling what 30% of his stock.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.160]   Does that, what does that mean?
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:40.760]   Well he put out a medium post where he was just like, nothing to panic about here.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.760]   Everything's fine.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:46.960]   Me and my wife are looking to make a lot more political and philanthropic contributions
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:50.840]   and we've got personal in our venture capital thing.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.600]   So still have some total confidence in Twitter, even though they pushed me off the board and
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.960]   made me so inside, let me completely.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.680]   But I just need to sell off some stock right now.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.720]   And he's sold like $4 million of it this week.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:05.640]   $4 million, which it's a shame he sold it now instead of earlier because it's dropped
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:07.560]   15% over the last three months.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.360]   Remember when it was only 70 bucks a share?
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.360]   So does he.
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:19.520]   So apparently investors are not spooked by this anymore than they're spooked just by
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.960]   this fact that Twitter sucks.
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:23.400]   I think they've got enough on that plate.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.560]   Williams will stay on the board and he says that's it.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.560]   I'm not selling anymore.
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:30.440]   It only hit the stock about 1% following the news.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:32.880]   So that's not a big deal.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:36.480]   I think what investors want to hear is somebody's willing to buy Twitter.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.360]   Although they can find a way to turn a profit.
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.000]   Because I mean, Ev Williams...
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.920]   Why can't they turn a profit?
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.680]   I mean, this is good stuff.
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.840]   They should be making money.
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.440]   There's no reason everybody uses Twitter, right?
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.520]   Everybody I know.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:52.880]   Now we're all using Mastodon.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:53.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.160]   Well, but they should be trying to make it.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.960]   I am as of the show.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.960]   I am too.
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:03.360]   So Mastodon has gotten a lot of press mostly because it figured out a way to make a new
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.520]   social look like tweet deck.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:06.520]   Right.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.200]   That's exactly it.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.920]   But user interface is important.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.320]   Mastodon has some nice things.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:17.400]   For instance, I really like this feature which is you can say on a post, "I want to
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:20.400]   hide the content."
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:23.720]   And what people are doing that a lot with which is great is political stuff.
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:25.640]   Not just like NSF.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:29.560]   Here's a Mastodon, a tutor as we call them.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.680]   Wilkie apparently is...
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:36.960]   She must know that I'm fasting because she's posting recipes and she says this is sensitive
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:37.960]   content.
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:41.040]   And here's her mac and cheese recipe and pictures.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:43.520]   That's sensitive content for me.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.160]   I don't want to hide that.
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:47.480]   I don't want to see that.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.920]   Oh man.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:52.400]   So Mastodon is kind of interesting.
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:53.480]   I've been playing with it.
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:58.840]   I tell you, like all new social networks, it's best when it's fresh.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:02.240]   Like right out of the oven because it's all because first of all, only geeks use it.
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:04.920]   Google+ was so good for like the first week.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.720]   You were mentioning how much...
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:10.360]   Actually, Google+ is good again because everybody left.
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:13.760]   Yeah, but people are there because they love it.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.920]   And so the quality has gone up on Google+.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.280]   Yeah, but I mean, Twitter used to be great.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:20.440]   It used to be this fantastic fire hose information.
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:21.440]   I love Twitter.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.880]   Yeah, I mean it's a fire hose information, but they're going to start futzing around
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:28.400]   with it and they've already added the ability to spam people in it.
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.720]   And now we've got the Twitter Lite platform coming out.
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:31.960]   Twitter Lite seems like a good thing.
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:36.200]   This is for mobile phone users who don't want to dedicate data.
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.200]   This is also...
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.800]   I think this is basically their place again to developing the development.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.800]   Exactly.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:41.800]   This is for India.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:42.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:44.960]   Well, that makes sense.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:45.960]   But then they start to...
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:46.960]   That's a good thing.
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:50.240]   But then they start to muck around with the newsfeed and ads, you know, things you may
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.160]   have missed and people you might like.
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:57.040]   Yeah, I kind of wish I could turn that thing off because every time I look at my Twitter
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.040]   feed...
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.040]   You speak about...
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.760]   Tweetbot doesn't do that.
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:03.560]   It doesn't because they don't have access to those things, the API.
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.840]   So the third party clients don't have any of that stuff.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:09.440]   Now, the downside is you can't do like group DMs and some other things that you want to
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.440]   do.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.440]   Yeah, I like some of the web only features.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:14.640]   Does TweetDeck, which is from Twitter, TweetDeck doesn't do that either.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.560]   No, they're usually behind.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.440]   They have most of the official Twitter API support, but because it was always a separate
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:24.080]   team, a lot of their things are you'll see, you know, it'll take time for them to get
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.240]   support for certain things.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:29.200]   And also, TweetDeck has a slightly different user base.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:32.440]   They understand that the most of the people who use TweetDeck are professional users who
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:37.080]   are using Twitter in a business capacity and not individuals, which is why...
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:42.240]   Actually, I love TweetDeck because I could do scheduled Tweets, which I have to pay for.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.160]   Which is useful for you because you're using a business context most individual users are
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:47.480]   never going to schedule a Tweet.
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:50.560]   So TweetDeck is a slightly different product.
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:56.480]   I can have a column just for the president, which I find very useful because I like to
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.560]   keep track of what he's up to.
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:02.760]   I can alert every time Trump tweets, along with about 10 other people.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:03.760]   Do you?
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:04.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:05.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:06.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:09.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:10.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:11.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:12.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:13.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:14.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:15.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:16.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:17.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:18.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:19.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:20.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:21.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.760]   I get one from my YouTube channel.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:29.760]   I get tweet alerts for, but I do.
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.760]   Only because he's so fascinating when he tweets.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:31.760]   Very odd.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:36.640]   Well, and honestly, I broke a story that way when it turned out he had the pyruvate tab
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.160]   open and something that he did a year ago.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.360]   That was very funny.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:45.440]   But no, we have a slack bot that's set up anytime Trump tweets in Slack.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.440]   It alerts us.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:50.680]   Well, then you probably already know that Jay-Z has pulled all of his guts from Apple
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:51.680]   Music.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:52.680]   It's back.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:57.080]   Oh, I thought I had a scoop and you already beat me.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:59.280]   Is that because you watched Twitter?
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:06.040]   It happened on Friday, but yeah, no reasonable doubt in the blueprint are still not on Apple
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.880]   Music, but they haven't been on there in a while.
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:13.200]   I get this auto play video to stop.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.200]   You know what's interesting?
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:17.640]   Google used to have a setting that turned it off and then they disabled the setting that
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:18.640]   turned it off.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:21.800]   I want to learn where to get on my iPad, by the way.
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:27.120]   There is a Chrome extension that turns off on a play, but then it breaks everything else.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.920]   Yeah, I have one called disable HTML5 auto play.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.840]   Yes, that's the one I use.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.720]   But then it's such a pain in the butt to get stuff to play, right?
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.600]   Because it's disabled off play.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.200]   So then you have to turn it off, refresh the page by that time I've lost interest.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:43.920]   So why did Jay- what was going on?
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.000]   Was this an accident?
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.160]   I think it was an accident.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:49.000]   It looked at first like it might have been a broader thing because it wasn't on Spotify
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.840]   either or Apple Music, but then it came back.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.000]   It was like a 24 hour thing.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000]   So I'm not sure.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.200]   It might have even been like maybe a deal expired or something.
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:01.800]   His blueprint series of albums and there are three of them are not on Apple Music and
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:05.520]   his debut album, "Reasonable Doubt," is not on Apple Music, but all of his other stuff
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:06.520]   is there.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:12.960]   Would he face scrutiny, any competitive scrutiny because he owns title?
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:13.960]   No.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.600]   No, because he also owns this master.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:18.040]   So if he doesn't want to have his music there, then absolutely.
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:22.040]   I mean, it would be up to, and I think that's kind of the problem is that he owns the masters
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.480]   for "Reasonable Doubt" in the blueprint.
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.160]   I don't think he owns all of the stuff for some of the other albums.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:30.280]   So, but no, I mean, if he wants to have, yeah.
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.360]   And honestly, if any artist wants to choose, like, we only want it on the service of that
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:37.160]   service, I mean, that's their choice, do it.
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.320]   They have to understand that by making those decisions, people want to listen to your music.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.800]   They will find ways to listen to your music and it probably doesn't mean subscribing to
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:47.800]   the title.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:50.240]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:52.720]   We'll talk hacking next.
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:54.080]   Christina Warren's here.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:55.720]   She's a senior editor at Gizmodo.
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:57.400]   Oh, a senior writer at Gizmodo.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:58.400]   You don't edit.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:57:59.400]   You write.
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:00.400]   I do edit.
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:01.400]   I edit some, but I write mostly.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:02.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.400]   Writing is like the editing.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:07.000]   Don't tell an editor this, but writing, you guys are writers.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.240]   Writing is the real work.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:10.240]   Editing is like, used to be an editor of Harry.
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:11.240]   There's some editing too.
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:12.240]   Oh, all right.
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:14.040]   I just want to get a full-time editor.
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:16.240]   I've now gone back to writing and do some editing.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.240]   Do you prefer to write?
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:18.240]   Oh, yes.
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:19.240]   It's much more fun.
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:22.040]   You know, you actually get out and do stuff rather than just reading through other people's
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:23.040]   ideas.
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.040]   You know what we do need though?
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:27.240]   Not for you guys stuff because you write perfect prose.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:29.800]   You have to bring copy editors back.
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:34.120]   The way I copy editors littered with bad grammars misspelling.
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:35.120]   Not fast company.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:39.640]   We have the actual copy editors, copy editing stuff for the web, which I think is pretty
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:40.640]   unusual these days.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:41.640]   Yeah, we have one.
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:42.640]   I would guess it's pretty unusual.
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:44.640]   I mean, you've saved my bacon many times.
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:45.640]   There's a lot.
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:46.840]   You know, I mean, just typos even.
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:49.000]   Yeah, we have one in the US too in the UK.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.040]   You can always tell, you know, when somebody filed fast and you know what you can tell
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:56.360]   is when they edited it and then they forgot to take out the extra word.
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.360]   Right.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:58.360]   Like, they only edit.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:01.440]   So there's like, it's like two sentences mushed together.
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:03.160]   I get DMs.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:06.920]   I literally, I'll tweet a, you know, tweet out a story and I'll get like four DMs.
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.480]   Like, you misspelled this for here.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:09.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:11.280]   So you have copy editors on Twitter.
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:12.280]   Exactly.
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:17.080]   Or my mom sometimes it's, which she, she in a former life was a copy editor, was a
[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:18.080]   editor.
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.640]   So sometimes she'll like, we'll send me like a list of notes.
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:22.680]   Here are all the problems with this and they thanks mom.
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:24.600]   My dad just did that to me.
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:25.600]   Mm hmm.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:26.600]   I like it.
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:30.000]   I will do that to my kids too, just to keep it going.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.240]   Actually, my kids used to mock me for using punctuation and text messages.
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:35.560]   Oh, no, I get.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:38.840]   Apparently some people think it's very rude to end a social media message with a full
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:39.840]   stop.
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:40.840]   Oh, it's called punctuation.
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:41.840]   You know, we do it.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:44.840]   It's a stop over using semicolons.
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:48.160]   Somebody, somebody tooted, not tweeted, but tooted that one of the best things about
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:53.320]   Mastodon is people know the difference in why you are and why you apostrophe are.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.920]   Yeah, that's so fair.
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:57.560]   Now that's, that's something I'm looking for in a social network.
[01:59:57.560 --> 01:59:59.360]   No, that's a deal breaker.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:00.360]   I'm sorry.
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:01.880]   No, I agree.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:02.880]   Totally.
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:11.040]   But, you know, I think so many, uh, programmers and, you know, hardcore geeks don't spell
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.640]   well that you kind of get used to it.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:18.520]   Like if you look at Reddit, yeah, I know, but it doesn't mean we give up the fight.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.520]   You know what I mean?
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.520]   It's there.
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:23.920]   There are rules for a reason, which makes it easier for everyone to read everything.
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:24.920]   Yes.
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:25.920]   I don't know.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:28.520]   Also, I, I can overlook a misspelling, but if you can't tell the difference between
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:30.640]   your and your, I'm out, I'm out.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:31.640]   Wow.
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:32.640]   You guys are harsh.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:37.640]   Did you see the story about the Oxford comma that solved a lot, you know, saved a company
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:38.640]   in a lawsuit?
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:39.640]   Yes.
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:40.640]   Brilliant.
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:41.640]   I love that.
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:43.640]   The Oxford comma can't do.
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:44.640]   Yeah.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:45.640]   It's so tell.
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:51.200]   So this is a $10 million lawsuit, uh, a main company.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:54.520]   Let's see if I can find the, uh, here's the New York Times article.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:55.680]   It was the Times article.
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:56.680]   Yeah.
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:04.640]   The main company, uh, was, uh, in the being sued, um, for $10 million dairy company in
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.600]   Portland, three truck drivers sued the Oakhurst dairy seeking more than four years with
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:14.400]   a number of overtime pay because main law requires workers to be paid one and a half
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:19.920]   times the normal rate after 40 hours, but it carves out some exemptions.
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:21.920]   And here's the exemption.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:28.320]   The, the overtime rules don't apply to the canning comma processing comma, preserving
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:34.240]   comma, freezing comma, drying comma, marketing comma, storing comma, packing for shipment
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:39.120]   or distribution of there's a missing comma.
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:45.920]   The Oxford comma did the law intend to exempt distribution of the three categories that
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.880]   follow or does it mean to exempt packing for the shipping or distribution of them?
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:59.160]   Well, the court decided the missing comma was germane in a 29 page decision.
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:05.200]   They said, uh, what, who won the company or the, the drivers, the drivers, the drivers
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:10.280]   they, they, they ruled in favor of the Oxford comma, uh, the drivers lawyer said that comma
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:13.600]   would have sunk our ship.
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:15.120]   Is it sunk or sunken?
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:16.120]   Yeah.
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:20.980]   Uh, so the Oxford comma for those who don't know, sometimes called the Harvard comma,
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:23.520]   serial comma, serial comma, this is what I come up.
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:25.240]   Oxford, we gave you the language.
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:32.280]   The Cambridge is, uh, in a series, uh, do you put a comma before the and or the or in
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:33.280]   this case?
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:34.280]   Or do you leave it out?
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:39.440]   I always prefer to use the, uh, the comma, the Harvard Oxford serial comma.
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.440]   Much much.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:41.440]   You all are serial comma.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.560]   When I worked at time, we did not use that.
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:44.200]   And I really gnashed my teeth every time.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:45.200]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.200]   At fast company.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:47.200]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.200]   And it was such a huge relief.
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.200]   It's a, it's a standard though.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.200]   Every publication has its own.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:51.200]   I think I still use it.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.440]   But Nashville did not, and I was like you, Harry, I hated not having to use it.
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.920]   And then Gizmodo does.
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:00.440]   And so I was very relieved to go back to it, but then it also took me a little while
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.320]   to get used to writing with it again.
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:05.360]   So I, but I was very relieved to go back to using the Oxford comma.
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:07.800]   And my brain, I always wrote with it.
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:08.800]   Yeah.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:15.960]   I, um, uh, I have to say I am always guided as I am in all things by strunk and white,
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:20.280]   which says in a series of three or more terms of the single conjunction, use a comma after
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:23.480]   each term, except the last.
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:24.480]   I mean, that's right.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:30.000]   We had comma white comma and blue as opposed to red, white and blue, red, comma, white.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.480]   It never hurts and sometimes it helps.
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:32.880]   Like I don't say why anybody would not.
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:34.120]   Why would you use it?
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:35.120]   Exactly.
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:36.120]   It's an extra character.
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:37.800]   It's called eats, shoots and leaves.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:39.920]   Oh, that's a fantastic idea.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:40.920]   Highly recommended.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:41.920]   Great.
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:43.480]   Like pedants of the world unite.
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:46.400]   You have nothing to lose, but you're unreasonable sense that things are not going.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.400]   You know, you know, there are two versions of each shoots and leaves.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.120]   There's the, the British version, which is better, I think.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:54.600]   And then there's the, the.
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:56.400]   Oh, they did the most convolution.
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:57.400]   They did.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:58.400]   They did.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.000]   In America, they altered it a little bit, but, um, which I didn't find out until I ordered
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.640]   what I ordered a copy off of the internet and then it turned out to be a British one.
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:07.640]   And then I got one in a book.
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.280]   So I was like, oh, it's a slightly different.
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.280]   Thank goodness.
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:11.640]   You said, I think good as you said that.
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:14.080]   Because when you heard there are two versions of each shoots and leaves, I thought you were
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.080]   going to tell the joke about the panda and the prostitute.
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:25.760]   The other thing is, is the reference to the strippers, comma, JFK, and Stalin.
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:26.760]   Yes.
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:36.200]   So it could have been strippers, JFK and Stalin individually or that JFK and Stalin are the
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.200]   strippers.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.200]   They are strippers.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.200]   They aren't.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.200]   All right.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.440]   Well, I think we made a strong argument for the serial comma.
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:44.120]   How do you guys feel about two spaces after a period?
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:45.120]   Absolutely no.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:46.120]   Never.
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:47.120]   No, never.
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:48.120]   Wow.
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.120]   Wow.
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:50.120]   I had no idea your feelings ran so high.
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:51.120]   That's clear.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:52.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:53.120]   That's, that's, that's taking a hammer to somebody.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.720]   Why is that clear cut?
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:56.720]   Why would you put two people?
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:00.720]   Because your computer takes care of your typography because I always did but I learned
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:01.960]   with the typewriter, right?
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:02.960]   Yeah.
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:03.960]   Obviously older than you guys, right?
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:05.500]   My first copy was written on something right.
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:09.320]   You hit it period and you go space space and you start the next sentence because your
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.160]   typewriter couldn't deal with typography space.
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:13.160]   It was mono space.
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:16.160]   Isn't that interesting?
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:19.320]   So on computers, you should not.
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:20.800]   No, unless you're at a mono space.
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:21.800]   They're still typing.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:22.800]   I'm telling it, career.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:27.400]   If you're using a typewriter, go for it all the spaces you want.
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:28.400]   Okay.
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:35.560]   So I don't know how I find out which one is the British version and which one's not.
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:37.240]   I'm going to definitely buy the British version.
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:39.600]   Oh, the Lindtruss is just a gem.
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:40.600]   She really is.
[02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:41.600]   Copy it.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:43.600]   She's a national treasure.
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:44.600]   A national treasure, wow.
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:48.000]   On a part, not quite on a part with David Nastenbro but getting close.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000]   Oh man.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000]   I, okay.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.400]   One last plug and then we'll do an add and then we'll finish up.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:06:02.880]   BBC Planet 2, I have it at home on the UHD Blu-ray with a HDR set.
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.080]   It is the best thing I've ever seen.
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:07.680]   If you have a 4K set and you have HDR, it's not expensive.
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.680]   I'll get it.
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:13.200]   Get the Blu-ray and my Blu-ray UHD player is my Xbox One S.
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:14.200]   Same.
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:18.320]   It looks, Christina, you'll just sit and watch it over and over again.
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:19.320]   Okay.
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:22.120]   I'll just sit on pirated BBC.
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:23.120]   Not the same.
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:25.120]   You can get it now on Amazon for $2.99.
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.120]   Yeah, okay.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.120]   I'll buy it.
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:28.120]   I'll do it.
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:29.120]   But buy the Blu-ray UHD.
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:30.960]   So one argument ever for physical media.
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:32.520]   Got it.
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.080]   Otherwise stream everything.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:35.880]   But that is the argument for physical media.
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:37.440]   It just is spectacular.
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:40.280]   Oh, and you heard about the HMS David.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.880]   The reason I mentioned is David Nastenbro narrates it.
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.880]   Yeah.
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:44.880]   What's the HMS David Nastenbro?
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:46.680]   You remember the Bosey McBogeface thing.
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:47.680]   Yeah.
[02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:50.440]   They couldn't name the ship Bosey McBogeface.
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:52.480]   It was just being an enormous embarrassment.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.480]   Yeah.
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.040]   So they called it the HMS David Nastenbro.
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.040]   Wonderful.
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:57.040]   Who doesn't love David Nastenbro?
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:01.880]   And then called the submersible Bosey McBogeface, which had its first trip to this week.
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:03.760]   Oh, Bosey McBogeface sales.
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:04.760]   Yep.
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:05.760]   Well, goes under the water.
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:06.760]   But yes.
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:07.760]   Sinks.
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:08.760]   Intentionally.
[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:11.760]   It did think intentionally, but then it came back up.
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:14.840]   And break, believe it or not, is 90 years.
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:16.160]   And still going strong.
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.040]   The best narrator in the business.
[02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:19.480]   What would last year's celebrity death?
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:21.480]   So I was just like, please let me get him through.
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:24.320]   Please let him get him through, you know, because he's amazing.
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:27.280]   You can't watch a nature documentary and not hear his voice.
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.560]   I'll give you a hug.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:35.400]   The Dick Dick bird rides on the back of the hippopotamus on his way to better times.
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:40.640]   You really should watch him getting a female gorilla, getting amorous with him in the 1970s.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:44.520]   This marvelous thing where he's in, he's with the gorillas and she's getting sort of kind
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.760]   of touchy-feely with him.
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.880]   And he's like, oh, well, this is terribly flattering.
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:50.040]   But no, we get me out of here.
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:51.760]   Oh, I have seen that clip.
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:52.760]   Yeah.
[02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:53.760]   I think we have it right here.
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:55.000]   I could play it for you.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.640]   David Attenborough meets the gorillas.
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:08:01.400]   Now, I've had some rough dates, but I have to say this would be drawing the line.
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:05.920]   There's one eight higher than that spends nearly all its time on the ground.
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:11.480]   It lives here 10,000 feet up on the banks of the volcanoes of South Africa.
[02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:13.040]   So young, but he's still great.
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:17.160]   And Ziya hits the biggest of all the apes.
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:19.360]   The Shiest is one of the rarest.
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:20.360]   And his own Tazis.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:22.360]   You're going to make some fun of them.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:24.120]   Oh, it's the gorilla.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:26.480]   The gorilla.
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:27.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000]   That's the whole higher.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000]   Oh, you two.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000]   I hate you.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000]   If they suddenly appeared close to them, talking about some ties, then they would almost
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000]   certainly charge.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:45.280]   Damn it, YouTube.
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.640]   We've been Rick rolled or something.
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:48.640]   We've been Attenborough.
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:50.360]   Attenborough rolled.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:54.840]   I should have noticed the poster of this was Mr. Coolio Iglesias.
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:58.400]   That might have been the giveaway.
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:00.840]   How about if we go to the baby?
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.440]   Is this the one from BBC?
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:06.640]   It's the female mother, I think, who starts playing with it and all grooming him in rather
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:08.640]   into a terrorist.
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.640]   That's--
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:11.640]   Oh, I'm British, really.
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:15.000]   You're a unicorn.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000]   It's been banned.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.600]   Apparently, the person doesn't want me to play it.
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:19.600]   Okay.
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:20.600]   All right.
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:23.560]   We'll leave this as an exercise for the listener.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:28.040]   At a later date, just remember, always use the serial comma.
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:31.520]   Our show today brought to you by Casper.
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:32.880]   I love my Casper mattress.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:33.880]   Have I say that?
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:34.880]   I can't say that enough.
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:38.080]   I love my Casper mattress.
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:45.120]   The Casper reinvented the mattress business by selling direct to you from the US-based
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:46.120]   factory.
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.160]   They're an online retailer of mattresses.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:50.920]   What people said, "You can't sell mattresses online.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:52.600]   How will you try them?"
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:57.080]   Well, it turns out lying on a mattress for five minutes in the middle of the day in front
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:02.240]   of a shopgirl who does not want you to take your shoes off is not the best way to try
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:03.320]   a mattress.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:08.440]   What if you could lie on that mattress for 100 nights?
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:11.000]   Then if you don't like it, you get to return it and get every penny back.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000]   That's how it works.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:18.160]   Casper is made of supportive memory phones for a sleep surface with just the right sink,
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:19.160]   just the right bounce.
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:20.160]   You want both.
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:23.880]   You want it to be firm so you don't have a bad back when you wake up, but you don't
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:29.880]   want your hips and your other pointy bits to be sticking out.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:31.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:35.360]   You sink into it, but then it's hard to describe, but you've got to try it.
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.800]   By the way, it's breathable.
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:40.040]   You sleep cool and I don't care if it's winter or summer.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:45.080]   Sleeping cool really is, I think, a good night's sleep.
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:48.720]   A Casper mattress provides long lasting comfort, support.
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:50.080]   You can easily buy it online.
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:51.560]   It's completely risk-free.
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:55.800]   They really put the effort into making a great mattress.
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:58.000]   You spend a third of your life lying on your mattress.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.440]   Don't you deserve a great one?
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:03.560]   You know if you've had your mattress for 10 years, it's time for a new one.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:06.720]   By the way, if you have had your mattress as one of those old spring mattresses, you
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:08.880]   know what lumps are.
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.640]   There's no springs in a Casper mattress.
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.920]   This thing is going to go for a long, long time.
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:19.040]   Free shipping and returns in the US or Canada, but I guarantee you, you won't want to return
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:20.040]   it.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:21.280]   This is the greatest mattress I've ever had.
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:22.280]   Get a Casper today.
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:28.520]   You'll save an additional $50 off when you go to Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit and use
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:35.640]   the promo code "twit-some-terms-and-conditions-apply" Casper.com/twit-promo-code-twit for the best
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:36.640]   mattress.
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:40.600]   Sleep great tonight on your brand new Casper.
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:43.320]   This has been a far-ranging conversation.
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:44.320]   We got gorillas in.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:47.720]   We were going to talk about hackers, the shadow brokers.
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:49.580]   Remember these guys?
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:55.400]   They had a fairly large trove of NSA exploits and they offered them for sale.
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:57.760]   They wanted $7 million.
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:01.840]   They got one offer for $9,000.
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:04.480]   They have dumped them on the internet.
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:10.800]   This was a busy Sunday because a lot of security researchers have a lot of files to go through.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:14.320]   So far, the reaction on Twitter is some of this is pretty old, like dating back to the
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:16.480]   1990s.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:23.720]   Mostly Linux, the mock monster on Twitter OS X Reverser tweets while files are old.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:26.640]   There's a lot of interesting stuff on the equation group files.
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.400]   The equation group is what the NSA group that develops as stuff is called.
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:32.640]   What they were looking at, methods, etc.
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.160]   Very cool.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:41.760]   Might not be interesting to young minds, but it's gold for 90s old farts, says OS X Reverser.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:46.560]   Actually, the probably most salient tweet is from Edward Snowden, who says, "A quick
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:50.880]   review of the shadow brokers leak of top secret NSA tools reveals is nowhere near the full
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:53.000]   library," and he ought to know.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.480]   But there's still so much here, the NSA should be able to instantly identify where it came
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:00.640]   from and how they lost it, if they can.
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:01.640]   It's a scandal.
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:04.320]   You have to know, tell us if they do.
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:05.320]   Right.
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:11.720]   Yeah, but you may remember that the shadow brokers came to light last August when they
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.360]   posted samples of the exploit code.
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:20.600]   And after the leak, the FBI arrested a former NSA contractor named Harold Martin.
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:25.240]   Yeah, it's unclear as to whether or not he was actually responsible for that, because
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:29.640]   the guy comes across in the trial as a bit of a hoarder who basically wanted all this stuff.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:33.040]   He had 50 terabytes worth of data over two decades.
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:34.040]   I was thinking polite.
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:37.880]   It sounds better than crazy old man who just went to heaven.
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:41.040]   He had worked both for the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:45.880]   Apparently, he's still a prime suspect for the big shadow brokers case.
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:48.560]   It's entirely possible.
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:52.440]   If you take the stuff out of the building and if you hold vulnerabilities in this way,
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:55.160]   somebody might get your stuff and then release it.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:59.840]   Yeah, but I mean, it's kind of, I was a DEF CON last year and they got a guy there from
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:04.080]   one of these Washington think tanks saying, you know, they're probably not holding more
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:07.280]   than a couple of dozen of vulnerabilities of the most serious.
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:09.000]   90% of them get pushed to the vendors.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.800]   And that's something like this comes out and you're like, no, they're holding on to anything
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:15.520]   that looks like it could be a lot of these were highly targeted.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:18.440]   For instance, there was a attack against, I think, a PDP 11.
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:21.000]   There was only 10 of them in the country or something.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.960]   So they're very, you know, which means there's not much to worry about for you and me unless
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.960]   you're the target of an NSA attack.
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:30.920]   Honestly, though, if you're the target of an NSA investigation, there was no...
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.400]   I was just in your interview.
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:33.400]   It's over.
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:34.400]   Yeah.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:37.880]   Apparently, the shadow brokers are fans of President Trump because they say we're releasing
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.120]   this because Trump has failed us.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.120]   Yeah.
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:42.960]   I don't think that might be disinformation.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.160]   I've heard one thing.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:48.880]   I haven't checked it out in the medium post, but apparently the medium post is 911 pages
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.960]   like sentences long.
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:51.960]   But I haven't actually...
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:52.960]   Ooh, that's interesting.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:54.960]   I haven't checked it out for something.
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:56.800]   That's the one Twitter and...
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:57.800]   I could find out.
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:59.960]   You just have to do in the e-max, so I can let you know.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:00.960]   Yeah, I just...
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.960]   I had things to do this weekend.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:03.960]   Enough.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:04.960]   It's really...
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:05.960]   Not least the show.
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:06.960]   It's really a...
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:08.920]   This is a political manifesto.
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:10.400]   It's very badly written as well.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:12.800]   Oh, well, they may not be English speaking.
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:13.800]   Yeah.
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:14.800]   Or they need copy editors.
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:17.240]   Oh, they just may not want to look English speaking.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:18.240]   Ah...
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:22.440]   Once you go down the rabbit hole on these things, you can just...
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:23.440]   Yeah.
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:24.440]   It's...
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:29.520]   So they say our auction was an apparent failure because it is our form of protest and they
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:35.160]   post the password for the files, the equation group files.
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.160]   And they say, "If you want to send a donation, here's our Bitcoin address.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:39.680]   I'm glad to take that."
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.160]   I want to just highlight that because I can.
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.160]   Okay.
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:46.520]   Medium, don't you love it?
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:48.320]   Why are you looking at videos of kittens?
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:50.200]   They just popped up on my feet.
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:51.840]   Oh, sure.
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:53.200]   Sure it did.
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:56.280]   Hackers breached the Dallas warning sirens.
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:58.400]   Oh, this is hilarious.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:06.080]   On Friday and woke the city up, 156 of the emergency sirens sounded in the early morning
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:12.160]   hours lasted until 1.20 a.m. Saturday, creating according to the New York Times a sense of
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:19.560]   fear and confusion, jarring residents awake and flooding 911 with thousands of calls.
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:22.520]   These are the sirens that are used for tornadoes, for bombs.
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:24.400]   I don't know if someone's going to San Francisco.
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:25.400]   Yeah.
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:26.400]   Yeah.
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.480]   All of the tornadoes sirens went off and they didn't just go off for a little bit.
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:31.200]   They went off for a couple of hours.
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:33.360]   That's annoying in the middle of the night.
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:38.120]   I know, but part of me was just like, okay, yes, it's annoying.
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:39.120]   It's antisocial.
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.000]   It's a real pain in the backside of your trauma sleep at that time at night.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.760]   But it's kind of a cool act.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:44.760]   It's a cool act.
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:45.760]   The mayor of Dallas.
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:48.880]   You don't condone it in any way, shape or form, but the mayor of Dallas said, we will
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:51.160]   work to identify and prosecute those responsible.
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:56.720]   I'm losing some confidence though, because he posted it on his Facebook page.
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:00.960]   That's where I post important announcements.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.720]   So I guess they do it for an hour and a half.
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:05.880]   I mean, a minute and a half, 90 seconds, really loud.
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:08.160]   And then they did it about 15 times.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.160]   Yeah.
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:11.640]   First, they weren't sure that it wasn't something actually happening.
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:12.640]   Well, right.
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:16.440]   You would assume that, right?
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:20.840]   So emergency workers unplugged it.
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:23.440]   Tried turning off and turning on again, basically.
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:25.400]   Yeah.
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:26.920]   We don't know how it was hacked.
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:28.800]   The Dallas has reached out to the FCC.
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:30.080]   Oh, that'll help.
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:31.240]   Yeah.
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:35.360]   And there are taking steps to prevent hackers from setting off the entire system again.
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:39.440]   If only they could figure out how they did it in the first place.
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:41.640]   A lot of these systems are very antiquated as well.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:43.880]   And the same with the 9-1-1 system.
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:44.880]   Yeah.
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:49.040]   It's actually surprising this hasn't happened before, to be honest with you.
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:50.040]   But I don't know.
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:53.680]   When I first came here, the San Francisco ones used to really freak me out, because every
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:55.840]   Tuesday at 12, they fire off.
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:01.080]   And I said to my co-worker, I was supposing the Russians actually launched, coincided
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:02.080]   with this.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.080]   So I was like, oh, it's midday.
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:05.080]   No need to worry about it.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:08.040]   I said, you know, it's the, we used to call that the noon whistle.
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:09.040]   I was a kid.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.960]   It's the noon whistle.
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:14.000]   So there's a, you've heard of DDoS?
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.480]   Distributed trial service attack.
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:16.480]   There's a new attack.
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:18.080]   It's called DDoS.
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:21.160]   Well, it used to be called "bricking things."
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:22.160]   Yeah.
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.160]   Permanent denial of service.
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:29.120]   Apparently, they're, so a company called Radware, which securities from created a honeypot
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:35.120]   of attackable IoT devices, you know, ones with hard, hardwired passwords, things like
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:36.120]   that.
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:40.760]   And they were attacked 2,250 times by malware.
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:45.760]   They dubbed it "brickerbot one and two," which wasn't designed to take over the IoT devices,
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:52.400]   but instead to brick them, erase all the data files, corrupt storage, and then sever the
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:53.400]   internet connection.
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:58.800]   And your internet connected camera, refrigerator, microwave oven into a brick.
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:18:59.800]   Yeah.
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:03.880]   I mean, basically it took tools that the Mirai botnet had taken, adapted them, and turned
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:07.040]   them to something which killed a device rather than turning it into a part of a botnet.
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:09.040]   She'd point out that while that's cool, it's still illegal.
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.040]   It's still hacking.
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:11.520]   It's highly illegal, but it does.
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:17.520]   I think it will have one really beneficial effect in that if this kind of stuff spreads,
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:21.800]   IoT manufacturers are going to have to get so much better than they already are at locking
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:24.640]   down their devices and securing them, because that is the huge weakness.
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:29.000]   It's one thing if my cheap routers used to attack the PlayStation network.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.080]   It's another thing if it stops working entirely.
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:32.080]   Now I'm mad.
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:37.840]   Yeah, but I mean, this is why I don't have internet of things, things in the house, because
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:42.800]   why rely on a third party, which can go down and why rely on devices, but such lamentably
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:43.800]   bad security.
[02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:47.680]   There is no excuse for, you know, putting this, putting this, I mean, you look at some
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:54.000]   of the stuff out there, a DEF CON last year, they tested 12 Bluetooth door locks.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:58.960]   Nine of them were encrypting, sending passwords to and from the door in plain text.
[02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:01.680]   So all you need to do is have a receiver and then the bushes to pick it up.
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:03.680]   How can that be?
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:05.080]   It was just really bad.
[02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:06.080]   It's kind of jaw dropping.
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:07.080]   Exactly.
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:08.080]   It's really poor code.
[02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:11.920]   And then of the three that didn't encrypt their stream, one was so poorly made, the guy
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:13.520]   opened it with a screwdriver.
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:16.040]   So, you know, I mean, you can't win on this.
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:17.360]   Either the mechanics have gone.
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:22.920]   There is a, I doubt this will get passed, but there is a bill up in the California state
[02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:31.520]   legislature to actually make it illegal to, you know, have, compel IOT security.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:37.000]   It's a SB 327 information privacy connected devices.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.560]   It calls for device manufacturers to secure their devices, protect the information they
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:43.280]   collect or store, indicate when they're collecting it.
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:48.840]   So it's privacy as well and get user approval before doing so and be proactive in informing
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.560]   users of security updates.
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:53.000]   There, unfortunately, there's no punishment specified.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.000]   Yeah.
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.080]   And I doubt this will pass, but hey, good for them.
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:59.080]   For trying.
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:00.080]   Yeah.
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:05.520]   I mean, it's, I think it's if calif, if one state, especially state as big as California
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:09.920]   passes something like this, it has a huge impact globally because if you're a company that
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:12.920]   sells IOT devices, you don't want to leave California out of your--
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:14.760]   If they enforce it, that's the big thing.
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:15.760]   Right.
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:18.200]   You know, I mean, it's like at the moment they're just talking, I mean, game.
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:19.200]   Right.
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:20.600]   Oh, I could go on and on.
[02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:22.360]   We're all bracing ourselves.
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:26.840]   Tuesday, Windows 10 will get, start to get a creator's update.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:30.720]   It will be rolled out over a period of time, maybe many months as it has been in the past.
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:34.680]   Microsoft won't offer it to you if they don't think your machine can handle it.
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:39.520]   If it's anything like last year's anniversary update, my recommendation be to wait until
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:41.240]   you hear the howls of pain subsides.
[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:44.440]   Oh, they're going to be drooling it out very slowly because they've learned from that
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:45.440]   experience.
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:50.680]   Well, the last time they did this, the anniversary update, they bricked a goodly number of webcams,
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:52.480]   not bricked them, but made them unusable.
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:54.560]   And the greatest update already has.
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:55.560]   Oh, really?
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:59.880]   Yeah, if you-- someone did an article about this last week, he downloaded the developer
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:01.640]   preview and it had bricked his webcam.
[02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:02.640]   Wow.
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:03.640]   Well, they've--
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:04.640]   No, it never did.
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:05.640]   But it just--
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:06.640]   Yeah, it made it stop working.
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:07.640]   It worked.
[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:08.640]   Yeah.
[02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:10.240]   And they also remember if you plugged in a Kindle after the anniversary update, it would
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:11.240]   crash.
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:12.240]   Wow.
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:14.280]   You know, it's tested against millions of people.
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:17.320]   There's millions of people in the insider program who are doing the beta test.
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:20.560]   Maybe your friend's problem will keep it from happening to everybody else.
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:22.680]   Maybe Microsoft will fix it.
[02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:24.680]   And finally, we'll end up with Project Scorpio.
[02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:25.680]   You all excited?
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:27.320]   The new Xbox comes out later this year.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:36.000]   Microsoft gave exclusive access to a pre-release version to digital foundry.
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:43.520]   And they're fairly well known.
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.440]   I gather in Europe as a company that not only analyzes his hardware from a geeky perspective,
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:49.440]   but has been critical in the past of games that can't live up to the 4K standard.
[02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:54.160]   They say they were able to on this six teraflop system, so a mighty system.
[02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:59.200]   They were able to run Forza at a 4K 60p with room despair.
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:00.680]   So that's good.
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:07.080]   The GPU is a massive GPU with how many different pipelines?
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:08.800]   It was like 43 pipelines.
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:16.440]   It's 12 gigs of DDR5 RAM, a custom 8 core CPU similar to the one in the Xbox 1S, but
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:18.640]   obviously heftier.
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:23.520]   And it's vapor cooled, which is a good thing, I guess.
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:24.960]   So here's the final specs.
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:31.760]   Three customized compute units in the GPU, each running at 1.172 gigahertz.
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:33.320]   That's pretty impressive.
[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:34.320]   Nice hardware.
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:36.840]   Yeah, well, they knew now's the games to run it on.
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:38.800]   Oh, to run on it, sorry.
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:41.120]   You know, they'll run the older games too, I think, right?
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:42.120]   It's not going to be incompatible.
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:46.600]   I don't think it's incompatible, but there's not a massive amount of really great game,
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:50.160]   you know, really great game game.
[02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:52.320]   I've been not a console fan full stop.
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:55.560]   You know, I don't like buying the bottom line.
[02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.880]   Oh, I'm a strategy game.
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:59.360]   So give me a good game of Civ 2 and I'm happy for a year.
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:00.360]   Civ 2, not 5?
[02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:01.360]   No.
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:02.680]   Do you like the modern stuff?
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:07.440]   No, it just got two up its own backside with all these sort of fancy graphics and overlays.
[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:11.560]   Just give me a nice simple game of Civ 2 and 10 hours and 10 hours free and I could
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:13.360]   quite cheerfully bumble through that.
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:18.880]   Do you like how do we all feel about our AOL and Yahoo's new name?
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:19.880]   Oath.
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:20.880]   Oh, boy.
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:21.880]   I don't die, Hannah.
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:24.480]   Oh, I mean, it's better than Tronk, I guess.
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:26.080]   Yeah, it is better than Tronk.
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:31.480]   There you can say, you know, thank you Tronk for making something actually arguably worse.
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:33.360]   I'm not sure if I'm a rapper, I think about Oath again.
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:35.720]   That will be a B2B brand at least, but.
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:38.200]   Well, but Flickr will be Oath.
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:40.400]   I think Yahoo mail will be Oath mail.
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:44.000]   When you do a Yahoo search, you'll be oathing it.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.080]   I wouldn't admit you're dealing with Yahoo.
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:49.880]   I have utter goals, but that's not what I do.
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:55.160]   The thing that calls me is that they probably spent a million dollars with some brand company
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:56.520]   to get that name.
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:58.440]   Oh, at least.
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:00.600]   Like who thinks that's a good name?
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:05.760]   Another big thing, but it sounds like you're lifting and also may or may or will be out.
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:10.880]   So she'll trigger a golden parachute and swan off to another company.
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:11.880]   Good for her.
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:12.880]   She's going to become a VC as a commercial.
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:13.880]   She's going to be a VC.
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:16.040]   She's going to become a VC as a chief.
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:17.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:18.040]   I would have thought so.
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:19.040]   Yeah.
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:22.960]   I mean, she's not just his cash.
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:23.960]   It's oath.
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:27.720]   Oh, a T H not oath OAF, although oath might be better.
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:28.720]   Oof.
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:29.720]   Oof.
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:30.720]   Oof.
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:31.720]   All right.
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:32.720]   That's it.
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:34.200]   I'm calling it oof from now on.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:35.200]   Oof.
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:36.200]   Oof.
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:37.960]   Christina, it's always a pleasure.
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:39.840]   I wish you could have been in studio with us.
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:40.840]   Same.
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:42.880]   Say I'm going to have to visit you guys at some point next time I'm out there.
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:43.880]   I'm sure.
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:46.720]   You're the greatest senior writer at Gizmodo film underscore girl.
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:47.720]   Read her writing.
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:48.920]   She does great work.
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:49.920]   She has.
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:50.920]   It's really a pleasure.
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:51.920]   Thank you, Christina.
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:52.920]   Thanks for having me.
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:53.920]   Yeah.
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:56.360]   Ian Thompson spells it funny.
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:57.360]   No pee.
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:59.640]   And there's an extra eye in there.
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:00.840]   I blame the parents.
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:02.200]   It's all their fault.
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:06.880]   I a I and T H O M S O N on the Twitter.
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:10.240]   You'll catch his work at the register dot code dot U K and as often as we can get him
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:11.240]   in here.
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:12.240]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:13.240]   It was good fun.
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:14.240]   Thanks for coming up.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:15.240]   Enjoy your soilent.
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:16.240]   Yeah.
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:17.240]   My first ever soilent.
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:18.640]   I have to say the aftertaste coming up.
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:19.640]   You like it, Harry?
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:22.800]   I'm going to take the rest of that home with me.
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:24.560]   I think you can use it to fertilize plants.
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:26.120]   I understand it's very nutritious.
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:27.960]   See if my cats like.
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:30.200]   Oh, that's a good one.
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:31.200]   I'm trying to catch.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:32.200]   Try on boo.
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:33.200]   Yeah.
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:35.720]   Although didn't they have problems with diarrhea and other versions I'd hate to give
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:37.360]   that to the cat.
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:38.360]   So would I.
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:39.920]   I mean, yeah.
[02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:40.920]   Harry McCracken.
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:41.920]   He's the technology.
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:45.600]   You'll find his work at fast company dot com.
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:46.600]   Always a pleasure.
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:47.600]   Marie is here too.
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:48.600]   Hi, Marie.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:50.320]   Lovely wife.

[02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:56.640]   Very interesting stuff.

[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:41.240]   No one's sitting in the bad chairs.
