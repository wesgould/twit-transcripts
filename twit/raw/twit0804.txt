[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.080]   There's not a lot of tech news, but fortunately, we've got great people joining us.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.000]   Father Robert Ballisair from the Vatican City, Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.960]   and from the register.com.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.080]   My friend Ian Thompson, we're going to talk about CES.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.080]   It's coming.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.960]   But what's it going to be like?
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.600]   The streaming wars, forget that.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.960]   It was an amazing 2020 for all the streaming sites and a farewell to Farmville.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.200]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.800]   From people you trust.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.800]   This is Twit.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.280]   This is Twit this week in Tech.

[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.640]   As we can tech.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.640]   Didn't mean to shout out.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.080]   Our first show of the new year!
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.960]   This is a show we get together and talk about the week's tech news of which there is virtually
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960]   none.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.840]   But fortunately, dear friends join the panel today and I know that we'll all have lots
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.880]   to say starting with our digital Jesuit Father Robert Ballisaire who is back in Rome I think.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.440]   I made it back here a couple of days before the new year and I have I think three days
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.600]   left in my quarantine before I can come out of my little room.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.000]   Oh geez, so they make you stay in your room for two weeks or for how long?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Ten days.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.480]   So we do ten days with a test tomorrow.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   Wow.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   Yeah, the third day from the last.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.360]   It's time to be prudent because I know the Holy Father does not like to wear a mask.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.680]   Yeah, we've been counseling on that.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.960]   Just for the optics you really should be wearing a mask.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.320]   But the vaccines have arrived and they're starting to get the first year.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.120]   So hopefully within say a month the entire Vatican will be vaccinated.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.000]   At least all of those over the age of 80 which is like 99%.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.960]   That's like all of us.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.320]   Anyway, I missed you.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.560]   It's great to see you again Father Robert Ballisaire.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.480]   Also joining us another old friend.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.040]   This is really an old friend week on Dwight Silverman who is the tech burger at the Houston
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   Chronicle.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.120]   Although, do you want to share your news or should we wait for a couple of weeks and
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120]   talk about it later?
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.640]   I know we can talk about it now.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.840]   I've been pretty open about it on social media.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.360]   I wound up saying I was going to retire.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.400]   There's a buyout at the Chronicle.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.280]   And I'm very close to turning 65 and I thought, well this is an opportunity so I decided to
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.920]   take the buyout.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.400]   And I was going to go off on my own.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.160]   Yeah, the last time we talked you said you were going to do that.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.880]   Yeah, I was going to go off and do a sub stack newsletter as every other journalist in the
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.640]   world is doing.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.120]   And I was going to do a medium blog and kind of work the two between each other.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.840]   And then I got contacted by the senior VP of content at Forbes who asked me to join them
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.240]   as what amounts to an online tech columnist with a newsletter.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.920]   And we're still kind of working out whether it'll be mostly newsletter or it'll be mostly
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.960]   stories, what the mix is going to be and what I'll be writing about.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.600]   And I will be a staff member and a full Forbes staffer.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   That's exciting.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.040]   And we'll go back to having a full time job with a boss.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.000]   Do you get to keep the money that the Chronicle gave you?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.800]   Yeah, you keep the buyout.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.000]   That's the best of all worlds possible.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That's wonderful.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.080]   Well it's good because I'm close to retirement.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   I am a retirement.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.400]   So you just sock that away and it becomes a good cushion.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.160]   If I love Forbes, I'll be there as long as I love it.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.160]   I'm writing you can do.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.320]   So I don't want to actually retire.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   I can do it.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.400]   Well, it's great to have you back.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.520]   And then ladies and gentlemen, he's Terry Thomas with a faux hawk, our very own Ian
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   Thompson.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520]   Thank you so much.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   Isn't that nice?
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.160]   Well, I had to explain it somehow.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.280]   Ian Thompson, the news editor at the register dot com.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280]   Hello, Ian.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.120]   Hello there and happy new year to you all.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   Happy new year.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.360]   Happy new year to all of you.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.080]   It's 2021.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.440]   Now there's some question about how you should spell that.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.920]   Some say, "2020 WON."
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.920]   Get it 2021.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.280]   Oh, I prefer to think.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   I'm going to be thinking on the positive side.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.880]   This is the year we come out of it.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.720]   We're going to come back.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   Everything's going to come back.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.520]   One thing that's not going to come back though.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   C.S.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.720]   It's too late for C.S.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.720]   C.S.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.240]   Next week.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.880]   It's all virtual.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.400]   How many of you have signed up for C.S.?
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.400]   Father Robert, Dwight has.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.160]   Ian, are you going to C.S.?
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   Nope.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.560]   No, part of the deal when I joined the register was I didn't have to do C.S. anymore because
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.360]   it's just a heaving mess of a show.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.000]   And yeah, okay, doing it virtually, we'll cover the news announcements.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.880]   Don't get me wrong, but we're not going to sit through endless presentations about this
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.480]   is our new Samsung TV.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480]   It's really cool.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   It does this and this and this.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.840]   So I'm totally confused about, I mean, I guess what it really is, is just a placeholder
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.360]   for next year when they can do it in person.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.840]   Is that right, Robert?
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.720]   Robert, you don't need to have an event if it's all streamed.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.120]   You don't, but they need to preserve the calendar.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.800]   You're seeing this with a lot of the big events.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.160]   They need to do something so that people get, they stay in the rhythm of the conference
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   season.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.200]   I mean, everyone knows that we know we have C.S. in January, then you have any be somewhere
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.840]   in April.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.240]   You got your security conferences like Black Hat and Defcon in August.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.000]   If you don't keep doing that, when you come back, you're not going to get the crowds you
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   want.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.560]   Now, you don't, the good news is you don't have to leave your quarantine in the Vatican
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   city.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.760]   So you can watch it all.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.240]   Dwight, is this, is this a good replacement for an in person?
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   C.E.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   S. or?
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.640]   I don't know if it's a replacement.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.560]   It's something different.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.600]   One of the only reasons I really signed up for it, I haven't been to C.E.S. in years,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.000]   but one of the reasons I signed up for it is that the experience that you have when you're
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.120]   covering the Apple events with their virtual unveiling is so much, to me, I find it more
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.160]   useful than going and sitting in that hall, even if I don't get the opportunity to lay
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.440]   hands on the devices for 30 minutes.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:04.000]   I think it's a much more, in terms of getting information, it's much more useful than having
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.040]   put up with the logistics of it.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.280]   And so I'm curious.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.920]   I'm really signing up more just out of curiosity to see what this is like.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.400]   I'm looking for any Houston companies who may be present.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.560]   And I'm looking for any interesting trends.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.400]   The problem is that I've only got two weeks left at the Chronicle, so I don't have that
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.960]   many columns left to where things are right about.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.440]   That's even better.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.560]   The best way to attend C.E.S. is without assignment, so you can just enjoy it.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:41.360]   When you learn, I see a lot more when I didn't have to write about it or record anything.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   Absolutely.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.680]   My favorite C.E.S.s have always been the one where I'm just wandering the hallways, because
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.520]   then I find something that catches my eye.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.820]   That's what I'm going to cover.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.120]   But I think they're doing it the wrong way, because probably the best conference replacement
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.600]   that I've experienced during the pandemic was DEF CON.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.960]   DEF CON in August, what they did was they didn't try to push it as an educational conference.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.720]   It wasn't DEF CON online.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.920]   It was, we know that this is the place where many of you make your connections with other
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   people.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   We're going to emphasize that.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.880]   So it was all about community.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.640]   I treat C.E.S. the same way.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.660]   I see some of those people just at C.E.S. if you play that up, it gives people a reason
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.980]   to come in.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.460]   I am registered for all the C.E.S. events, but I'm probably going to attend maybe half
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:32.940]   of them, just because I have no interest in doing another Zoom call.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.940]   Just to see your stuff.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.060]   That's to me, it sounds like torture that you just, you know, lead butt, sit in the seat
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.940]   and watch this presentation after presentation with buzzword after buzzword.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.840]   I guess, you know, it's like just having to watch a really bad season of television or
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   something.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.280]   The other problem is, and this baffles me, for some reason, many of the keynotes are at
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.040]   4.30 in the morning California time.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   Like, huh?
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.360]   Yeah, it's bizarre.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.720]   Why?
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   For you?
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   Because of Italy.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.720]   Because of Italy, you love it.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.880]   It's going to be great for you.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   So, all right.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.880]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   I mean, DEF CON did it right.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.300]   The whole Discord server thing worked really, really well.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.060]   But still, companies are getting it wrong.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.780]   I mean, RSA announced they were going to do a physical Expo and then withdrew that very,
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.620]   very quickly.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.140]   I don't think DEF CON is going to go ahead this year either, to be honest.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.300]   But you know, we'll see how C.E.S. turns out.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.660]   And from a press point of view, if they are doing online press conferences, that saves
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.140]   us the two-hour wait to get into a press conference only to be sold at the door.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.140]   Yeah, we're full.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.480]   So, I mean, it makes a lot of sense for presentations.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.200]   How could you duplicate the booth experience, though?
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.740]   Are there going to be like, do you schedule one-on-one calls with people over Zoom?
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.440]   Is that why they're going to do that?
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.280]   Well, Google's not even trying.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.640]   And they've said maybe that.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.880]   Google has not tried all year.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.760]   I got it, by the way.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.080]   And maybe we'll save this for later.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.480]   But Google really seems to just given up in 2020.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.960]   It's like, "Pfft!"
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.940]   And now this, what are they doing for C.E.S.?
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.940]   Nothing.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.940]   Nothing.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.940]   I mean, nothing.
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.540]   They'll be showing a little bit, but they're not really doing that much.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.180]   And look, I can understand them giving up on 2020.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.860]   It's been an ex-grant Phil Pinata of a year.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.060]   And we've just had to get through it and deal with it, you know, deal with what needs
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.340]   to be done.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.700]   But I honestly don't think conference season this year is going ahead either in its usual
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:35.060]   format based on the very slow and odd way that vaccines are being sent out.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.340]   So next year, maybe.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.840]   Maybe.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.280]   Maybe.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:47.400]   We actually, this came up on Mac break weekly because Apple seems to, despite the fact that
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:53.080]   they, just like Google, were affected by COVID-19, stores were closed, employees were sent home.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.100]   They seem to have come out with a large number of products, very successful products, even
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.880]   announced an entirely new chip architecture for their Macadage computers.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.360]   It seemed like they were working this year.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.760]   Google, even when they announced the Pixel 5 phone, it was such a home home event, they
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.160]   were wearing slippers and like it was like, it was the strangest experience.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.360]   I feel like, is it just me, Dwight, have you noticed this that Google seems to have lost
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   their mojo in 2020?
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.960]   Yeah, I think they, you know, I don't think Google was ever really great at selling its
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.360]   devices anyway.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.400]   You know, their marketing has been fairly, here's a phone.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.000]   You'll like it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.920]   And it's kind of been at that level of intensity already.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.520]   So I'm not kind of surprised at what they've been doing this year.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.520]   Thank you.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   And I don't.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.920]   Google I/O, they just said, yeah, never mind.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   Right.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.920]   Right.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.520]   I mean, Microsoft had several developer events.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.440]   Apple had more events than ever.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.280]   Google said, yeah.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.120]   That shows off the difference between the back to front and the front to back approach.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.160]   So Apple is a back to front approach.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.800]   They design it and then they release it.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.040]   That's always been their mojo.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.560]   We know what people want.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.840]   Even if they don't know what they want yet, we're going to show them.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.600]   Google is absolutely front to back.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   They want to release a little bit, see if it generates excitement, and then they build
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   on it.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.520]   Well, in something like a pandemic, the front to back dies because you're not getting that
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.560]   immediate feedback.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.160]   You can't bring your equipment out in front of masses of people to say, okay, they like
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.400]   this, they don't like that.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.680]   That's not to say it's a bad approach.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.280]   It's just it's far more affected by something like a pandemic.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:42.880]   Yeah, except that 2020 was a boom year for technology companies, all of whom stocks went
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.840]   through the roof companies like Zoom were discovered.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.120]   I mean, there was opportunity in 2020.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.560]   It wasn't like, oh, we could just skip this year.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.080]   No big deal.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   There's nothing to say about it.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.920]   It just bad happens to me.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   Where did that come from?
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   I don't think Google's people buy.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   People were buying laptops.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.800]   I mean, that was the number one seller.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.520]   I mean, but there's services.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.840]   Google Meet could have been Zoom.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.920]   I mean, there were a lot of opportunities for Google services and things.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.200]   I just don't feel like they paid that much attention.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.560]   Wait, I forget about it.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.480]   Are we still on duo or have we moved on?
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.480]   Have they killed duo yet?
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   Well, that's the other problem.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   No, no, you're a meet now, which they introduced.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   This is what I mean when they're so ever.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.480]   Terrible at marketing.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   Meet is a terrible name.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:35.120]   But that has been something I've really noticed this year in that all the major companies who
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.480]   are dealing with online meetings drop the ball apart from Zoom and even Zoom had its
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   problems.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.320]   But you'd thought Microsoft and Skype, Google, and its video conferencing, FaceTime could
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.680]   have been expanded, all these opportunities and it takes an outsider to come in and go,
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.880]   yeah, look, this is really easy.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   You just click on this button and click on this button.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.880]   Man.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.120]   And it's something everyone's parents can understand.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.960]   This was the year of Zoom.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.440]   I mean, 2020 was.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.640]   It's amazing how this company almost feels fortuitous.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.160]   It didn't feel like this was a strategy that Zoom had up its sleeve.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.800]   I can't wait till there's a pandemic.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.320]   We're going to be ready there.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.440]   It just weirdly was in the right place at the right time.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.880]   Can you think of any other company in history that has had this amount of market penetration
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.120]   in such a short time?
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120]   Incredible.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.120]   No.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.360]   I don't think there's an example.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   I don't.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.080]   It came with its problems because they tripped up on security originally, but then they recognized
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   what was wrong.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:36.440]   They hired the A team of security to basically go in there and fix it and touch wood.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.800]   It's looking pretty good at the moment.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.200]   Nobody talks about Zoom security anymore.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.320]   Well, except for that one Zoom guy that they had to fire because he was working for China
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.320]   and shut down.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   Yes.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.720]   Shut down some Zoom conferences because the government of China didn't like it.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.520]   Except for that, nobody's talking about Zoom security at all.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   It's a very strange thing.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.120]   What was interesting about Zoom is that there are a bunch, not a bunch, but there are several
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:07.560]   other companies that have essentially the same product where you send a link, you click
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.280]   on it, it launches, you see multiple people, and it's just as simple.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:20.320]   But when it happened, Zoom, maybe because of the name, was the company that was able
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   to most take advantage of it.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.320]   Why wasn't it Microsoft Teams, for instance, just as well positioned?
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   Because the team's terrible.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   The team's terrible.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   Okay, well, that's a good start.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   It's slack.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.560]   It's not Zoom.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.560]   Right.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.520]   It's a slack clone.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.480]   It's a slack clone.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.960]   Microsoft's trying to make Teams be the Zoom for 2021.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   There's no question.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   All right.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.200]   So back to CES.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   Are we excited about LG demoing a bendable OLED gaming monitor?
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.520]   You press a button.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.520]   It's curved.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   You press another button that's flat.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.520]   Are we excited about that?
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.520]   No.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:01.840]   I've got to say, I'm really, really skeptical about any kind of flexible screen at the moment
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.600]   after the complete nightmares we've had over the last 18 months.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.400]   I mean, yeah, okay, they're bending it slightly rather than flattening it rather than trying
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   to fold it over.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   Sorry.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.360]   But, you know, it seems to be like a problem looking for a solution.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.680]   You know, it's just a solution looking for a problem.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.160]   It's just.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.160]   Are we?
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   It's not that much.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.720]   Are we excited about the see through TV?
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.720]   Because it wasn't that much TV.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.280]   What I want to do is see something else.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.160]   That's, that's my thing.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.160]   It's a strange product.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.440]   I don't know what the market is.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.680]   We will see as we saw in person, but this is the problem.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:43.960]   Here's a really good example of why a virtual conference makes no sense.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.920]   There will be micro LED TVs all over the place, but you'll be looking at them on Zoom.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.920]   So who cares?
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.420]   Right?
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:57.120]   That was the one thing I was impressed with this year or last year in the CES.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.920]   Some beautiful TVs Samsung selling its first micro LED this year.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.600]   A giant one is it 180 inches for $159,000?
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:13.040]   I mean, I like TV as much the next person, but for goodness sake.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.680]   Well, see, you'd like it more.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:20.840]   Because if you see Ted Lasso on a 150 inch screen, then it's you're like there.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.720]   You're right and immersed in the.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.520]   No, it's not.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.000]   No, I can't.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.840]   I do want the emergence of affordable large OLED screens.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.240]   That I actually am interested in.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.520]   Well the LG rollable that we've seen for the last four years in a row is finally coming
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.520]   out.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520]   Only a hundred thousand.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.520]   Is that in your budget?
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.520]   No.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.920]   LG's transparent OLED.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.920]   Let's see.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   You're right.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.520]   I think OLED the real question though is will OLED be supplanted?
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:03.360]   So we're going to see a lot of new LCD technologies like mini LED, which are just better backed
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.360]   lights.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.280]   And those will be less expensive than OLED.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.240]   And then we're going to see micro LED is still too expensive.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.920]   But you know, it's maybe two or three years before the prices start to drop.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.640]   I wonder if OLED, what OLED may be the plasma of 2021.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   This might be the last gasp.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   Wow.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.640]   What do you think?
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   That's bold.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   I love OLED.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.360]   Well, although it's still in your phones, you know, the LED is kind of the standard in
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.400]   your phone right now.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:39.160]   But but even then there's talk of Apple and Samsung moving to newer technologies in those
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.160]   screens.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.600]   I think I think LED in their screens that Apple is apparently.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.560]   I think companies like Samsung who also have a retail presence, you know, they have their
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.000]   own stores in in a lot of big markets.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.920]   I think they they stand to benefit from CES because if they can get those products into
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.680]   the stores, even just for demo purposes, people who hear about them via CES can go out
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.400]   and see them immediately.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.240]   And I think that that's, you know, those companies like that will have some benefit.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:20.840]   LG, of course, in years past has had that giant video wall of OLEDs when you first enter
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.960]   the central hall.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   And that's a great thing.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.440]   I don't know.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.520]   It's not going to really be quite as good on a zoom call.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.760]   Are they using zoom by the way?
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.960]   What are they going to use for CES?
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.120]   If they said what their technology will be, I'm still waiting for the links.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   So it depends.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   It's not just.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.160]   There's a couple of events that are happening the same week.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.880]   And actually there's a couple of events happening this coming week.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.840]   But I'm I won't know until I actually get the link to see the interface.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.320]   LG will be showing.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.680]   Get ready for it.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.840]   QNED TVs.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   QNED.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.120]   These are mini LED TVs.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:06.000]   So to be clear, LED TVs are actually LCDs with LED back lights.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.080]   And the mini LED, they're so small you can have lots of them, which gives you a better
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:18.760]   local dimming, better dynamic range, and not a better name.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.760]   It's not.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.760]   QNED.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.760]   QNED.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.240]   I wonder who came up with this.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.120]   You know, I mean, is it a marketing department?
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.520]   Is it technology department saying, no, we must have, you know, a few minutes.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520]   You've been acting.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.800]   It stands for something, I'm sure.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.240]   The Q is quantum dot.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.040]   Oh, the N is nano cell.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.120]   Quantum and nano in the same name.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   It's got to be good.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.040]   It's got to be great.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   How about eight k.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.440]   A Rick and Morty episode.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.880]   This is always traditionally CES has always been a generation ahead in the TVs they show.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.640]   8k.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.760]   We saw last year, right?
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.280]   There will be a lot of 8k TVs.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.920]   Again, I don't know what it means to have an 8k TV at a virtual conference.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.520]   We're streaming 1080p of this 8k TV does not.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   QNED.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.600]   If you're lucky, yeah.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   Anything else.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:23.160]   I mean, the, the, we always enjoy going to the, you know, the basement in the, you know,
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:28.880]   the North Hall basement and places like that, the Sands Expo Center where you get the weird
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   off brand stuff.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.200]   I don't know how you do that in the virtual conference.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.520]   Do you have a little, do you have a little tiny.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.880]   And the strange thing is it's, it's that gear.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.680]   It's that equipment that I think would be best for a virtual attended conference because
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   you're right.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.440]   The screens, they mean nothing.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.200]   You can show me the largest resolution screen you have and I can't tell.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.960]   Show me something that's just been invented by a guy in a basement.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.880]   I, I'm very interested in that.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.400]   Some conferences, I don't know what CES is going to do, have a virtual lobby or a virtual
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.120]   show floor.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.520]   And then you, as you, you can browse it and then click a link and be in a booth.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.160]   I don't know what that's going to be like though.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:20.760]   There was a, there was a virtual showroom like that for the rollout of the most, I believe
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.920]   it was the note tent.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.240]   No, no, it was the fold, the galaxy fold too.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:31.160]   And it was, it reminded me of being, of being, of being and using one of those interactive
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.120]   CD-ROMs back in the day.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.080]   Well, you know, we walk, it was like being in mist.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.560]   Now you walk in, you click on something, it tells you the specs.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.200]   You walk to another area, you get a demo, you get somebody talking about it.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.680]   It was kind of cool, but it, it, it did really seem like a CD-ROM experience, but it gave
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.560]   you more context, more of kind of a showroom and a show floor context that I've seen in
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560]   other places.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560]   I like that.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   I'm going to say it's the CD-ROM experience.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.600]   I've, I've got to say, I've, I've been to some virtual events and immediately started
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.280]   flashing back to Second Life and it was just like, wow, this is like Second Life with a
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.760]   tiny tweak, you know.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.240]   It's like, have we not got better than this?
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:19.440]   I've had a couple of pitches for virtual conferences using Oculus and, and VR headsets.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.080]   No, no, no.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.360]   Oh, apparently they're using Teams.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   Thank you, chatroom.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.400]   CES to be powered by Microsoft Cloud, Teams, Azure and more.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:39.040]   So in other words, the first three days of CES will be spent taking care of all the permissions
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.200]   that are not sent properly.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   Oh, geez.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   Exactly.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.280]   I mean, I'm sorry, I've yet to meet a single person who likes using Teams.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.520]   You know, it's like people are raving about Zoom.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:53.760]   Not that peeved off with Google, but it just when Teams comes around, everyone's just like,
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760]   well, can I do this?
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760]   Can I not do that?
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.760]   Is it watching me now?
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.320]   Is it not watching me now?
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.680]   And it's a very strange setup.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.920]   I don't understand how Microsoft has dropped the ball quite so badly on this one.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.800]   Showstoppers and PEPCOM, those are those little events before.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.320]   They're going to do events.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.600]   They're going to have a virtual PEPCOM, lobbycon kind of thing.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:20.360]   In fact, I think somebody on our team went to the most recent PEPCOM event as a kind
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.120]   of warm up.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   Probably Ant.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.560]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.760]   Be interesting.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.800]   It's just a weird year all around.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.680]   Anything you've seen, any of you that you're looking forward to finding out more about
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.160]   at CES this year?
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   Honestly, I'd like to hear more about the autonomous cars because that's been a big
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.080]   feature for the last couple of years.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.560]   And I don't see how that's quite going to work virtually unless they can give, you know,
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.560]   do a proper Q&A.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:56.120]   But the car thing's really coming on fast and CES has traditionally been strong on it.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.840]   So I'll be keeping an eye on that one.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.440]   Yeah, there's some things they could do with self-driving cars that would be kind of interesting.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   They could put you in the back seat.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:10.120]   And you could go for a ride around Vegas, which would be kind of cool, kind of fun.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   Is fake?
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.120]   I don't know.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   Has anyone been to Vegas in the last six months?
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.120]   It must be like a ghost town.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.120]   I have.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.280]   I have just because that's where my parents were.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.280]   Did you go to downtown?
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   Did you go to the strip?
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.640]   Did you see anything?
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.720]   I actually drew, I took them out of the house in the car.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   We never got out.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.160]   We never all found the windows just because I wanted to get them out.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.160]   It was packed.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.680]   Yeah, I feel like there's crazy people there.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   Nobody was wearing a mask.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.920]   Nobody was social distancing.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.440]   It was absolutely packed.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.240]   It was just an weekend.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.920]   I suppose it makes sense on one level because Vegas has traditionally made its money from
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.280]   people who are really lousy at working at odds.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.840]   But to actually see it in there is just bizarre.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.320]   So is there anything CES related going on in Las Vegas?
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:03.920]   They're doing anything ancillary on a small scale like maybe demos of self-driving cars
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.760]   at all?
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.600]   Or is it just there going to be no physical presence there to zero?
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.160]   My understanding is there's no physical presence because it's too expensive to try to set something
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.040]   up and then find out maybe on the last day that there's been another lockdown and it's
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   all off.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.160]   No one wants to risk it.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.880]   There will be I-Heart Media disclaimer.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:36.400]   My employer on the radio show is going to have a music and immersive interactive experience.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.560]   I don't know where it'll be.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.200]   I mean, you'll attend it virtually.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.280]   Ryan Seacrest will host it.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.800]   A fireside chat with singer-songwriter Duolipa.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.600]   Is that how you say it?
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   Duolipa?
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   Duolipa?
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.760]   And a special performance?
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.760]   I don't know.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.200]   By Billy Eilish?
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.000]   7 PM.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.520]   So there'll be a concert.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.000]   That's always one of the fun things about CES used to be.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.640]   I think it got less interesting as the time went by.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.440]   But it would be the after hours events, the parties, the concerts.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.560]   There was some pretty cool stuff in years gone by.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.320]   Well I think maybe Dwight and also Padre might remember this.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   But do you remember when CES about 10 years ago was all about 3D TV?
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   Oh yes.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.520]   And they had that Taylor Swift, the Sony had the Taylor Swift conference which ended up
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.040]   with the CEO of Choni visibly creeping out Taylor Swift.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   Oh, that's good.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   I'm a like it.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.040]   I'm a like it.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.040]   I'm a like it.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   I'm a like it.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   It's just like that.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   It's creepy all the good luck.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   It's creepy all the good luck.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   Oh, God.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   Oh, my God.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.120]   I wonder how they're going to do that if they're going to try to do a live event which
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.040]   they'll stream or if they'll just have everybody in their living room.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:49.200]   Our standards have really changed for what we consider entertainment during all of this.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.520]   I'll just watch somebody's living room.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   I'm in my living room.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   You're in your living room.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.560]   Although I got to say some of the best music has come out during the pandemic of people
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:06.000]   just recording in their homes covering a song and then releasing the video, you know, just
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.280]   them playing it on the internet.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:13.400]   There's a bunch of really excellent music out there as a result of this.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.080]   And you got to wonder how that's going to change the music business.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.760]   You know, when when as you said once we get it come out of this.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.840]   It's one of my favorite topics is what's going to persist and what's not going to persist.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:33.240]   For instance, weirdly last year hardcover book sales were up 18%.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.080]   So I don't think that's going to continue.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.000]   I think that's like a that's because of the pandemic.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   That's a blip.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.160]   Audio books also up I think 16% and ebooks which have been dying.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.000]   They've been down every year for the last few years were up as well in the double digit
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.960]   percentage.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.280]   But none of those trends I think will continue.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:30:01.240]   On the other hand, streaming services gained about 50% overall in customers.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:06.720]   And that I think is is going to hasten the end of cable television.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.320]   And it's going to really move us to the over the top world that we've been slowly moving
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.840]   to it's going to hasten it.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.920]   So it's interesting.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:19.720]   In some cases, the pandemic makes changes that won't last.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.800]   But I think things like zoom will continue for a long time.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:28.480]   I think streaming tell I mean Disney plus had a huge year because of it.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.040]   Well, I got to say, why not?
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   Go ahead.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.960]   Usually on New Year's Eve, my wife and I will go out clubbing or raving as I believe it's
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.040]   known in the year.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.480]   And so three years ago, for example, we were watching one of our favorite bands in Glasgow.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.760]   And yeah, it was a great night out.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.000]   And this year they did a paid stream.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.040]   We listened to it at home.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.720]   I didn't have anyone let you on the wife.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.160]   I could have a cup of tea when I wanted to.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.400]   It was actually a pretty good night.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.760]   You missed the energy of a club.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.720]   But I think those kind of streaming services are really going to take off.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   Well, that's what I wonder.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:06.000]   I mean, there are certain in-person things we do like conferences and concerts.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.640]   I mean, I have to feel I have to imagine that live performers are suffering mightily because
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640]   of this.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.120]   And will they come back?
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:21.200]   They say that the 1920s, the roaring 20s was part of the reason it was the roaring 20s
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.880]   is because people were so burned out from the pandemic of 1918 and being quarantined
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.480]   and masked for so long that when they finally came out, it was the roaring 20s.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.720]   Do you think we'll have our own roaring 20s?
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.720]   Yes.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   You think so?
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.720]   Yes.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:42.120]   Without a doubt, there's a book I've been recommending a pale writer, which is about the
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.320]   Spanish flu pandemic.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.760]   And in it, they talk about kind of the changes in society as a result of that.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:54.840]   And yeah, I think we're just going to have an explosion of people traveling, going to
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.240]   parties, concerts.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.120]   I think every band in the world that's a name will get out and tour.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:06.560]   I mean, I think it's going to be like a frantic golden age when this is all done.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.480]   Oh, I hope you're right.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:14.280]   Because if you look on so many media like all of my friends on Facebook, I think it's
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   a great thing.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.360]   And Instagram, all they talk about is, when this is over, here's where I'm going.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.120]   And they post pictures of countries they've been to that they love.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.360]   It's what my wife and I fantasize about practically every night is, where do you want to go first?
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.920]   What do you want to do first?
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   Right.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.640]   And remember, the roaring 20s wasn't just about people going out and partying.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.840]   It was people changing what they've come to expect from society.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.080]   After such a prolonged time of not being able to do what you want to do, suddenly you're
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.880]   changing how you consume.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.480]   You're changing what you consider to be success.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.400]   You're changing what you consider to be stable employment or stable housing.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.480]   We could do the same thing.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:01.240]   And if you do that, the companies that latch onto that and start feeding that appetite,
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.160]   they're going to make a mint.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.360]   It's going to be a free for all once the dam breaks.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.080]   And that's mostly analog, you think?
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   Analog companies.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   Experiences.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   Physical experience.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:22.480]   I mean, the one comment I'm getting again on social media is when this is over, so many
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.160]   people are going to get hugs because no one has been able to hug everyone else.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.320]   No one's been able to go visit anyone else.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   Why stop bugging?
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.480]   Let's just all rip off a nose.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.400]   You know there's going to be a massive baby boom.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   Yes.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.400]   Nine months after this ends.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   Yes.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   Absolutely.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.400]   It's a huge kissy.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:46.480]   Let's take if we really want the roaring 2020s to duplicate the 1920s, we should ban alcohol
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   as well.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.160]   Let's just do that too.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.160]   Let's just repeat it.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.160]   Let's just repeat the formula.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   We know the whole thing.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.560]   Now we remember how it ended with a great depression.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.600]   So maybe we could skip that part.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.600]   But well, that's good.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.080]   Well, yeah, but I mean, yeah, the prohibition of alcohol did have a huge social influence
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.320]   on the United States because men and women started drinking together for the first time,
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   for example.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   Right.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   Different races started mixing together.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.600]   It was an enormous social driver, albeit in an incredibly stupid policy.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.560]   But, you know, I mean, it was an enormous driver for social change.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.720]   And you saw women's henlums going up and they were started smoking.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.480]   And okay, so it was all good.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.360]   But I mean, you know, men and women mixed.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.920]   I might start smoking.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   I might.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.920]   I might next year.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   I survived.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.440]   It took me years to keep it up.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.440]   I've never taken this.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.440]   This weekend smoking.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   No, I promise.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   I'm not.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.440]   I am not going to start smoking.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.960]   I applied for a job in a magazine in the 1990s and they had a cigar reviewer.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.960]   And that was his job.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.960]   What a great job.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.280]   Oh, what a great job.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.480]   There's still the magazine.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.560]   Cigar aficionado is still out there.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.560]   Sure.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.560]   Really?
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.360]   So Dr. Mom is saying there already is a baby boom, but I think there'll be a double boom.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.600]   It'll be like a sonic boom times two.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.880]   I think there'll be a, I think there'll be a divorce boom as well, to be honest.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.440]   I don't wish to sound cynical about this.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   You're right.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.440]   I think you're right.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.520]   I think, you know, this has already happened to a couple of friends of mine.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.760]   And when people are released from their houses and being the same close confines with their
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.600]   partners, and maybe having decided over the last year that, yeah, this is maybe too much
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.600]   of a good thing.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.360]   I think we're going to see a big divorce and a big baby boom.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:31.160]   Well, think of all the single people who have been alone for the last nine months.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.600]   Just think about those people.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.680]   They may be anxious to pick up on some of those divorcees.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   Who knows?
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.840]   You know, might be a good thing all around.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.840]   I don't know.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.840]   I just, I've always find this fascinating.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.560]   I think that that's interesting that that's what happened in the 1920s.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.160]   So I hope so.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   I hope so.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   Let's take a little break.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.560]   We have, we have a very nice panel, which is good because we have very little news in
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.840]   Thompson is here from the register.com.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.640]   What do you do at the register.com over the last few weeks of the year?
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.840]   There's nothing to talk about.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.840]   Well, because we're a British owned company, we had a British Christmas, which was, we
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:14.600]   stopped on Christmas Eve and we started again on, we'll start again on January the 4th because
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.120]   a good long Christmas is the British tradition and we think people should have it.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.120]   That said, we did have a couple of news pieces, one of which we may be discussing later, where
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.400]   Juneau's voluntarily came out of, out of the Christmas period and wrote stuff up simply
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.560]   because it was really important.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.960]   Like solar winds, of course.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:37.120]   Well, that we got rid of fairly early, but it was the British government's really.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   Resit?
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.000]   Bissar Brexit advice, which I think they're coming to.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.920]   But as it turns out, one of our guys did some digging and there was a really good reason
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.080]   for doing what they did, but more on that later.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.360]   I actually wanted to ask you about Brexit.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.120]   You're our token Brit.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.880]   And our token priest is also the...
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.040]   Bloody rebellious, colonial.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:05.400]   The digital Jesuit himself, Father Robert Baliser, who's back eating soggy pasta in Vatican
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   City.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.960]   Did you at least eat well when you were with your family?
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.960]   I had all the food you can probably tell.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:20.240]   I mean, when I got home, it was just, it was a feast every single day.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.680]   Oh, what fun.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.120]   Not necessarily because it was great food, but because it was different food.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.480]   I was yearning for anything that wasn't pasta.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.480]   Great.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.560]   That's Dwight Silverman, who lives on tech burgers.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.120]   That's his newsletter, HoustonCronicle.com/techburger.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.760]   He's taking his act on the road.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.280]   He'll be joining Forbes in about a month.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   That's very exciting.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.520]   Well, when you come back, we'll talk about, but that's good to have you do it.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.520]   Good to be here.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.160]   I'm your token Texan.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.800]   Our token Texan.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.200]   That's true.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:57.520]   I want to say you may have noticed there's a slight difference in the video feed you're
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:03.040]   watching today because we decided to take this opportunity to upgrade what has been
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.360]   the backbone of Twit and all of our video production since the very beginning, our
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.960]   new tech Tri-Caster.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:16.120]   And John has been so excited for John, the end of the pandemic happened when we got the
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:21.880]   new Tri-Caster to elite, which is the new top of the line Tri-Caster.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.320]   Do you have some things stored up?
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.440]   You can show us with the Tri-Caster.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   We're still learning it.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.080]   We got all sorts of new stuff.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:33.080]   It's the most complete live production system on the planet.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.800]   In fact, New Tech has updated its entire line of Tri-Caster.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.840]   No matter which you select, you get, it's the most amazing suite of media production
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.640]   capabilities at your fingertips.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:49.560]   This is something I'm going to miss at CES this year, is Kiki Stockhammer demonstrating
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.240]   what you can do with a Tri-Caster.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:56.600]   I just would stand in awe and watch as she pushed the T-Bar and pushed the buttons and
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.600]   all sorts of amazing things happen.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.640]   It's more than a live video production.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:06.160]   The Tri-Caster 2 Elite we use here at Twit is an all-encompassing digital media solution.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:11.240]   If you create content for the internet, for mobile, for television, for your church, for
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:18.000]   your synagogue, for anything that you're making TV productions, you need a Tri-Caster.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.800]   The Tri-Caster 2 Elite is software-driven IP native technology.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.480]   That's one of the things we're most excited about.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.240]   It provides the capability, connectivity, and control you need to take on any sort of
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.200]   digital media production.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.360]   When you think about the variety of features, I'm actually really impressed because our
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.960]   team, they just dig into this.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.800]   They go, "Oh, what else can I do?"
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.600]   There is no other live production solution that can enable the digital media workflows
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.280]   like the Tri-Caster 2 Elite.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.000]   It's like Live Call Connect, which is built in now.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.120]   It's this new text latest innovation and enhances your production by letting you connect to
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.920]   anyone, anywhere, on any device with high quality video and audio regardless of the caller's
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.760]   device.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.720]   That means you can use Skype, you can use Teams, you can use Zoom meetings, you can use Slack,
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.560]   you can use anything.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.840]   The most popular video conferencing applications are all there.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:19.720]   There's the Integrated Live Set technology, which we don't use, but it's amazing.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   You've seen it.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.080]   Well, the problem is you probably have seen it, but don't know because it lets you transform
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.440]   any location into the most elaborate virtual environment.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:33.240]   With the New Tech Tri-Caster 2 Elite, you get access to a premium library of New Tech
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.800]   Live Set virtual sets.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   You can have it be any way you want.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.360]   Choose from an extended variety of simulated environments, whatever you need to fit your
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.800]   brand, your style, or just get wacky and have some fun with it.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.920]   And then there's the Live Graphics Creator plugin.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.040]   We've just started to dip our toe into this.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:55.240]   You can design animated titles, motion graphics, looping effects, and you can do it with the
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.880]   creative cloud tools that you already know and love, then import them directly into your
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.400]   Tri-Caster Live production system.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.440]   We were able, all the lower thirds you see now in our production are just basically Photoshop
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.440]   files.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.680]   It made it so much easier to do what we're doing.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.080]   And you might maybe notice how nice and clean our graphics look now.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.800]   Live Graphics Creator lets you produce and present spectacular Live Graphics faster and
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.560]   easier than ever before.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.640]   When you're ready to take your production live, there are presets built in for Facebook
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.280]   Live, Microsoft Azure, Twitch, YouTube Live, and more.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.040]   With a flexible implementation, a more complete set of capabilities, and a unique capacity
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:42.120]   for distributed production, Tri-Caster 2 Elite frees you from the traditional boundaries
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   of live video production, the Tri-Caster 2 Elite.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:52.800]   We are so proud, so happy to be a Tri-Caster house and to be able to use our new Tri-Caster.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   It's transformative.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.040]   It's setting new standards.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.800]   It's really, it's better than broadcast.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.680]   Go to newtech.com/tri-caster.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.480]   You'll find an easy to use interactive guide that kind of lets you walk through the features
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.600]   and choose which Tri-Caster is right for you.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.200]   Newtech is N-E-W-T-E-K.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.280]   Newtech.com/tri-caster.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.840]   We've been working with the Newtech team now for how long is it, John?
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.680]   It's probably 15 years.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.440]   It's been really fun to watch the Tri-Caster just get better and better and better and
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.280]   more and more professional.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.200]   I don't think Twitch would exist without the Newtech Tri-Caster and we're so excited
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.880]   to get to the New Tri-Caster 2 Elite.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.280]   John's just hopping up and down, up and down.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.280]   We've had trains.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.160]   We've been having so much fun playing with it.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.840]   We've got a new control surface.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.680]   That's just sweet.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.440]   It's cool.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.520]   Thank you, Newtech.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.520]   Appreciate it.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.520]   Really do.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.320]   You guys rock.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.800]   Rock.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.880]   Somebody wants to know if the chatroom's saying, "What happened to the old?"
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.080]   Oh my God.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.800]   Another display of overcooked eggs from front of the robber balancer.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   What are those in?
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   Soggy.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.600]   It looks like they're soggy bell peppers there.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.400]   It takes them bell peppers and leave them out for a while and then drop an egg into
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.960]   it and overcook it.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   It's good stuff.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.440]   You're an Italy-
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   Roman dish.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   I know.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   That's what's frustrating.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.360]   You're easily the home of good food.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.160]   How the cooks might be whipped naked through the streets too.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   They're praised.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.320]   Actually, I've suggested that.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   That's a question.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.280]   Do priests cook or do you have a staff of cooks?
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.000]   We're not allowed to cook.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.640]   So, if you have more than a certain number of people in a house that's considered an
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.120]   institution and we're not even allowed into our own kitchen.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.440]   Oh my gosh.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.960]   Is that a union rule, a government rule?
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   It's a government rule.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.960]   Oh, interesting.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:49.000]   So even though the Vatican is its own country, you're still governed by Italian regulations.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   It depends.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.040]   So, if I'm in the office, the office says actually in Vatican City.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.640]   The house where I live, it's got two addresses.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.480]   One in Vatican City and one in Rome.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.560]   Oh, that's so weird.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.280]   Is there like a line in the floor that you watch step over?
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.280]   I'm in Italy.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   I'm in the Vatican.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.280]   I'm in Italy.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   There actually is.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.480]   So, if you see the plaques, there are plaques that say Zona extraterritoriale.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.280]   When you see that, that means you've crossed into the Vatican.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.360]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:21.640]   So one of the places on Lisa and my list when we can travel again is to come visit you.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.800]   So, don't stay there for a little while longer.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   Okay.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.960]   I don't think I have a choice.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   [laughter]
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   I've asked.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.840]   You just, you know, you serve at a higher authority.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.360]   I don't know how much you can do about that.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.360]   Let's see.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.740]   By the way, that book that you were recommending, I just wanted to pass it along because I know
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.460]   people will ask us called Pale Rider, the Spanish flu of 1918 and how it changed the
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.460]   world by Laura.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.460]   Yes, great book.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.460]   Great book.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.460]   That's great book.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:55.160]   I actually read another book, I think it was Gina Colada's book about the Spanish flu
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   some time ago.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.320]   And it is really a fascinating story.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:05.240]   And I don't think people, like, I don't remember my grandparents talking about it at all.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:10.280]   And I suspect that my kids probably won't tell their grandkids about this year either.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.040]   It's like, they don't want to, they don't remember it.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   They don't want to think about it.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.040]   They don't want to know.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.040]   It's terrible.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.120]   And one of the most interesting things in that book, and I did an interview with the
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:26.240]   author for a story I did, strangely enough at the very start of the lockdown about what
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.240]   will stick.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.840]   It was kind of the thing you're interested in, Leo.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.000]   And we talked, and as part of that story, I interviewed the author.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.880]   And one of the things she pointed out is that one of the reasons we have the health insurance
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:43.760]   system that we do now in the United States was because it came out of the Spanish flu.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   Oh, interesting.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   And that pandemic.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   Interesting.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.160]   It's not a health insurance business then, and it came out of that.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.800]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.640]   Well, I wouldn't be surprised if health care in the United States changes after this.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   It's good.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640]   Can't get worse.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.680]   So, you know, I mean, it's just, I think a lot of Americans are now realizing that,
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.520]   you know, universal health care does kind of make sense.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.160]   You know, not it just, other countries seem to be coming out of this a lot better than
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.160]   America is.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.200]   And it's not just picketed politicians.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.960]   It's the fact that if you don't have a job, you don't have health care.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.280]   And other than the emergency room, and that doesn't work out very well.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.800]   So, it may be even more of these changes.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.560]   One of the biggest reasons why people say they're not for universal health care is
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.680]   they said, well, it's the cost.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.680]   It's the cost.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.680]   It's the cost.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.080]   I don't want to pay for other people's health care.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.280]   I think what the pandemic has shown is, well, if you run that model and you have a pandemic,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.600]   it destroys any cost saving you could have ever imagined.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.920]   The cost you want to wear the other is the point.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.920]   Right.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   Precisely.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.360]   We've basically lost from what just what we've lost from GDP, we've essentially lost
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.560]   the equivalent of universal health care in the United States for 30 years.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.520]   So do you really want to take that risk?
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.560]   Meanwhile, across the pond, Brexit happened.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.320]   Who would have fun?
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.320]   Congratulations.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   Congratulations.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   Okay.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.920]   Look, I've been getting a lot of this.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.840]   This was the one advantage of Trump getting elected or the first tangible advantage.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.240]   People stop talking about Boris.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.480]   I mean, after three months of people go, ah, you see, you've made stupid decisions too.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.280]   And America said, hold my beer and watch this.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.920]   What is it about strange, orange hair that attracts these guys?
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   I don't understand.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.920]   It's a very, it's a very, it's so.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   But the problem is Boris is a sex symbol to some people.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.880]   I mean, I've got people who were good friends who were just like, yeah, I do.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.880]   And you're like, really?
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.880]   He looks like a lapidoule.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:57.120]   I'm not saying I do him, but I have to say, if you, if you, if they weren't world leaders,
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:02.520]   they're both kind of charismatic, funny people that you would kind of like, they're, they're
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.000]   like Benny Hill.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.880]   They're like, you know, somebody, you, you, you're amusing.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.360]   The problem is if the pandemic, sorry, go on.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   No, no, go ahead.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   I'll just get.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.720]   The problem is that as the pandemic has shown, having an amusing leader, not a good thing.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.720]   Sottle used.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   Not a good thing.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.800]   You've got a global crisis going on.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:30.840]   So the Brexit trade deal, which was 921 pages included a section on encryption technology
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:39.400]   saying you should use modern email packages, including outlook, Mozilla mail and Netscape
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.920]   communicator 4.x.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:49.480]   The last I should point out, made your release of next next Cape communicator was 1997.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.680]   I'm thinking this maybe was cut and pasted from somewhere.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.600]   Well, yeah, what have I guys actually tracked it down?
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:03.640]   And it was cut and paste from a 2008 treaty on the EU genetic database.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.360]   Even that's out of date in 2008.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:11.160]   Communicator was out of date by 11 year, hadn't been developed in 11 years or something, nine
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.160]   years.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   What's going on?
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.160]   Oh, come on.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:18.720]   It's only relatively recently that if you logged into some government, US government websites,
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.120]   you had to use Internet Explorer.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.120]   Oh, that's true.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.360]   I mean, it's, it cuts both ways as an awful lot of dead tech out there.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:33.320]   It recommended a 1024 bit RSA encryption and the SHA one.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.360]   You all won the hashing algorithm on.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.240]   Even Microsoft's given up on show one now.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.680]   I mean, you can crack it for less than 50 grand in cloud.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.680]   Oh, it's nothing.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:50.240]   It's just, it's painful, but the whole Brexit thing has just been a complete nightmare from
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.400]   start to finish.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.120]   So we're out.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.120]   That's it.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.320]   You know, I'll make this prediction now in 10 years.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.840]   We'll be back capping the hand begging them to take us back.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.840]   But yeah.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.240]   Yeah, we should see.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.360]   There's some odd ball side effects too.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:14.520]   For instance, for years, my father wrote a beautiful British Raleigh bicycle with a lovely
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.360]   Brooks handmade leather saddle.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:23.360]   These are made in England and then shipped to the owner of the company, which is Italian
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.000]   company and they can't be shipped back to England.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.360]   You can, if you're in England, you can no longer buy these English made beautiful bicycle
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.240]   seats.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.880]   And I imagine that's just one of a million little weird side effects.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.920]   Oh, it's, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:46.280]   It's like the UK government is proclaiming, well, we've got a good deal and you can still
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.280]   trade with Europe.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.080]   If you're willing to spend, you know, a couple of hours doing the paperwork and if you're
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:55.480]   buying from a European supplier, who you're going to buy for a British one or a French
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.280]   one or a German one.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:02.080]   You know, if you can get a seamless transit between France and Germany and you and yourself,
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.800]   why on earth would you go to Britain in the first place?
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.280]   And this is going to hit our tech industry.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:11.540]   I mean, it's already hitting the software jobs market because I've now got five friends
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:19.000]   in the UK who have moved to Europe the minute the Brexit vote came in and are now applying
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.400]   and getting for getting citizenship.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.000]   So there is a massive brain drain going on in the Arctic Kingdom at the moment.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.600]   So people who are going to be staying, people who are either retired, too dumb to move,
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:38.840]   don't have skills which could translate overseas or who are just so caught up on the little
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.840]   Englander thing.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.760]   And it's just when you turn your back on the largest trading block in the world who just
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.600]   happens to be 20 miles across the English channel from you, it's not going to end well.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.960]   It really isn't there.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:55.160]   I read a good piece on camera roof was in the independent of the Guardian that said it
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.920]   but a lot of it's just a nostalgia for an England that never really existed, the plucky
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:06.000]   island that fought off the Nazis in World War in World War II.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.240]   And of course, anybody who's read any history knows that Churchill was completely new.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.080]   This is this is over unless we get the United States to get involved.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.600]   We are toast.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:25.400]   And the fear of Hitler invading was completely terrifying to everybody.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:32.640]   But for some reason, there's this nostalgia that, oh yeah, this Emerald Isle, this Britain,
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:37.440]   we fought them off in 1940 and we don't need Europe at all.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:42.080]   Well, there's the apocryphal tale that when Churchill gave his great speech in Parliament,
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.880]   we shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight them on the landing grounds, we shall
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.280]   fight them in the hedgerows.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.600]   We sat down afterwards and then said to his partner and then we'll fight them with broken
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.120]   bottles because we've got nothing else to do it with.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.600]   Oh, God.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.400]   Well, I mean, you've got people like Dyson who was one of the biggest backers of Brexit
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.520]   and he's moved his billion dollar empire to Singapore.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   That's just nuts.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.600]   I mean, just look at the people who were pushing for this saying, oh, I'm patriotic.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.160]   Yes, I am with London.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.160]   I am with England.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.640]   I am a citizen of the UK and then they moved out.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.960]   That should be a pretty good indicator of how this is going to go.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:21.480]   Boris Johnson's father announced a couple of days ago, he's applying for French citizenship.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   Yeah, awesome.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.600]   You know, one of the richest men in Britain who supported the Brexit campaign has already
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   moved to Monaco.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:33.200]   But for the people that are backing it, this was about tax laws and getting there, you
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.960]   know, making sure they got theirs.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.920]   So I think an awful lot of people have been misled on that one and it's going to turn
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.800]   around and buy just on the bum for quite some time.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:49.640]   It's difficult when you're a small island nation not to be a partner in these trade negotiations
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.880]   with a larger block.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.120]   We'll see.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:57.160]   We always have had a special relationship with the UK and I think Americans love the
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.160]   UK.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.720]   Well, I definitely love it and that it's quaint, but I've yet to hear a politician
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.560]   on this side of the salty puddle.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.000]   I mean, when they go to England, then it's yes, you have a great special relationship
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   and the rest of it.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.680]   But over here, I've never heard it called special relationship.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.160]   And also, let's consider the word relationship.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.600]   That's what you call someone who's shagging.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.920]   You don't want to acknowledge his apartment service.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.920]   Oh, Lord.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.960]   Oh, I have heard that.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.000]   I've heard that line special relationship for a long, long time.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.240]   That's a very common thing.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.240]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   You're right.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.240]   You're saying then to do.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.040]   We've updated it for the modern age.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.840]   We now call it, I think it's a booty call.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   Booty call.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   It's special.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.120]   You know about that father.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:47.440]   I have to say, he knows more than I do about these things.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.920]   It must be an occupational hazard.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.920]   Research.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   I've got the internet.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.000]   Yeah, people come to you and confess all sorts of things.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Okay.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.920]   Yes, I can say that there have been a couple of times where I've had to be very polite
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.120]   and I've had to be very official.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.240]   And afterwards, I'd have to look something up and go, what the heck was that?
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.800]   What was he saying?
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.600]   That's when the urban dictionary is so very, very handy, I must say.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.600]   Let's see.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.600]   Let me get back on tech here.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.720]   Let's quickly before too long.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.400]   Hey, here's a story that made me so very happy.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:28.960]   You know, Wondery, which is a podcast network founded about five years ago.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:37.600]   They have shows like Dirty John, Doctor Death, The Shrink Next Door, Amazon just bought them
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.600]   for $300 million.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   Wow.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:47.000]   I've heard people say, and it's going to be part of Amazon music, I've heard people say,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   "Oh, yeah, this is Amazon trying to build a podcast business to compete with Spotify
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.720]   and maybe perhaps Apple will get into this and others."
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:03.080]   But honestly, Wondery is not going to give you a podcast business.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.440]   I'm not sure exactly what it gives you.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:11.720]   What do you, please explain to me, what's the land boom in podcasting?
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.880]   What's that all about?
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:19.080]   In this particular case, with Wondery, it gives them intellectual property that Amazon
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:22.440]   studios can use in a variety of ways.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.120]   So Dirty John has already been turned into a mini-series.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:30.080]   Doctor Death's going to be a television source.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:37.840]   So, what Wondery specializes in is it's almost more like an old-style radio theater.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:43.200]   Their podcasts are true crime and they tell stories.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.400]   And this is something that's just gold for Amazon studios.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:53.560]   Turnin Lopez, who founded it as a former Fox executive, in a way this was Quibi Dunwright.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.000]   This was, because he founded it in 2016.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.440]   This was Hollywood saying, "You know, this digital transformation is happening.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.680]   How do we get involved?"
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:06.800]   And instead of making sideways video of seven minutes that you could put on a phone but
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:12.440]   not on your TV, he came up with this, which was I think probably a better move.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:18.040]   And unlike Quibi, Wondery is still in business.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:21.640]   So good news.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:28.160]   Fox, I mean, sorry, Amazon has not said when the Wondery deal was expected to close.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.360]   It's one of those deals it has to be.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:37.160]   I mean, at this point, $300 million is a rounding error for Amazon and they know that they can
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.880]   make money off of content.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:44.040]   And they also know that right now, I'm not disparaging the catalog that Amazon has.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.320]   They have some great shows.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:48.760]   They've got things like the Expanse, some of their independence.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:53.040]   Netflix is kind of kicking their butt on the content side.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:58.240]   And rather than trying to match them beat for beat, this could be a smart play.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:03.760]   They're going off into a territory that's not really taken up by any of the big players
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.480]   and Wondery gives them access.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:15.240]   Actually Amazon in 2020 was this number two Amazon Prime, the number two network in terms
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.800]   of growth did very well in 2020.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.880]   So it is your right.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.480]   Netflix is number one, then it's Amazon.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   I had a list.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   See if I can find that.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.080]   I mean, they've had some shows.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.880]   Sorry, after you've pleased to wait.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:36.560]   So one of the things that's interesting about this to me is you've got Spotify buying up
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.280]   essentially podcasting studios.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.080]   Amazon has made its move.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:50.120]   And Apple, which for years was the place you went to get podcasts, has kind of fallen out
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.800]   of that running.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:59.360]   And if you have an iPhone or a Mac, yeah, you use it to the easiest way to get podcasts.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.080]   But they don't have any exclusive content.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:07.480]   They're not kind of marketing anything as this is an Apple podcast.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:13.400]   But I wonder if they're just watching this and thinking it's not worth their time or
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.040]   why they haven't made that move themselves.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:19.640]   Yeah, interesting question.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.280]   They are apparently hiring people and creating content.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:28.080]   But as you said, Father Robert, they do it behind the scenes.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:35.440]   And I wonder if it might be that in six months, maybe at the WWDC or an Apple event, they'll
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.440]   announce, oh, and here's our whole.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.080]   You know, new line of podcasts.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.560]   Plus, yeah, exactly.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:47.200]   I mean, Apple doesn't seem to be having a great deal of success in the content side of things.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.280]   And I mean, HBO is doing fairly well.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.120]   Amazon's not doing, but I mean, the boys seems to go to be doing fairly well on Amazon
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:58.920]   and they've still got the grand tour and the rest of it all did have.
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.600]   But yeah, Netflix is still eating everyone's lunch at the moment.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600]   It's interesting.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.880]   And rightfully so, they've put some really good shows onto streaming and created some
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.520]   really good shows for streaming.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:16.160]   Well, and again, this is such an unusual year because people are watching so much more
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.960]   that actually I think one of the reasons Amazon Prime Francis has done well is people finished
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:28.400]   Netflix and something, you know, they're subscribing to more services than ever before.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:33.740]   Wall Street Journal said they have a Harris poll that said Americans on average say they're
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:38.000]   willing to subscribe to 3.6 different streaming services.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.520]   Do you remember when we thought cord cutting was going to save money?
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.160]   Oh, not even close, not even close.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.680]   Although actually, father, as I would say, if you haven't seen it, dairy girls on Netflix,
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   well worth a watch.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.200]   You keep plugging that every time you're here.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320]   I love it so much.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.320]   He loves dairy girls.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   Yes, he does.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.280]   I only do Netflix one month a year.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.600]   One month, I binge everything and then subscribe.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.920]   No, it's just I don't need it.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.800]   I've finished Netflix in a month.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:15.160]   Oh, and by the way, Amazon Prime in Italy, it's ridiculously cheap.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.920]   I pay 29 euro for the year.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   Oh, wow.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   Wow.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.920]   Wow.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.840]   So here's the, this is the graph I was looking for from the Wall Street Journal cumulative number
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.560]   of US streaming subscribers.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:34.760]   The red is Netflix, 66 million, but prime video, probably because you get it with Amazon Prime,
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   right?
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.280]   47.9 million in the Q4 2020.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.040]   Hulu's number three with, let's see, 34 million, 35 million.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.040]   In a sense.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.800]   Then CBS all access with 10 million.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.080]   That's got to be Star Trek, right?
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.200]   I mean, I'm surprised to see that in the list.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.200]   Showtime.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.280]   Disney Plus coming on strong.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.280]   Disney's going to move up.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.080]   I see Disney hitting four, three or four, actually.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.080]   Disney's now at 37 million.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.720]   Yeah, Disney's got the content and they are very, very good at marketing.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.560]   HBO has grown.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:18.080]   Disney has thrown all of its eggs in that basket and they will make sure that it happens
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.080]   for them.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.920]   That's the future of their entertainment business.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.520]   We talked about it when it happened a couple of weeks ago.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.040]   Warner is putting all its movies on HBO Max.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   Right.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.360]   And all for 2021, all the first-time movies will stream live for free on HBO Max day and
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.200]   date with the release in the theaters.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.200]   Indeed.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.640]   I mean, many people's not just the movies.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   Like Mandalorian has redeemed the Star Wars universe for a lot of fans who were so jaded
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.640]   with the trilogy.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.640]   Right.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   Interesting.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.080]   And I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.080]   I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.080]   I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.080]   I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.080]   I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.080]   I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.080]   I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.080]   I think that's the only way to get into it.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.960]   HBO stuck their content on Netflix as I understand it.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.720]   And then they've just decided to out with it.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.120]   Let's cut out the middleman and do this ourselves.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.520]   And I agree with the father on Mandalorian.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.520]   Although I think Rogue One went an awful long way along that way as well.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.080]   Still the best Star Wars film after Empire.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:44.200]   So almost all the top 10 shows dominated by Netflix in Nielsen's weekly top 10 streaming
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.720]   list.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.200]   But the Queen's Gambit was I think its biggest hit.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.800]   The crown is probably also in there.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.280]   Disney Plus is the Mandalorian and Amazon's The Boys,
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:59.560]   both of which you guys mentioned among the other shows from other networks to break
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.880]   into the top 10.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.760]   I can't believe the expanse isn't up there.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.480]   People need to watch the expanse.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.840]   That is the expanse is incredible.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.320]   It's an incredible show and the new season is out.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.680]   And I was so mad they didn't drop all of the episodes at once because now I got a week
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.680]   fee to do what I'm not going to watch it.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.400]   I'm going to wait until the end because I will I need to binge the whole thing.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.640]   I just love that story.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.840]   I love what they've done with the universe building.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.200]   Are some shows better binged and others better watched weekly?
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.760]   Or is everything better binged?
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760]   I don't know.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:39.680]   I mean, I think honestly on one level, I kind of miss the old days where you had to wait
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.200]   a week to and I've been doing this with Bake Off, for example.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.000]   It's frustrating that you can't binge that straight off, but there is a certain kind
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.680]   of freescent in waiting a bit and actually waiting until it comes out.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.760]   The only downside of course is the internet.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.040]   So you've got to stay off certain forums and the rest of it for two or three days because
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.000]   Britain before the US.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.960]   I don't want my British mates telling me who's won, but there is a certain old fashion style.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.520]   Honestly, I think for anyone who didn't grow up with VCRs, they just got to want to binge
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.520]   everything.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.840]   Well, the other problem with the internet is when Wonder Woman 84 came out that day Christmas
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:24.160]   night, there were a lot of server errors and issues because everybody watched it all the
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.160]   same.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.480]   The minute it came out, everybody tried to watch it.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:32.240]   And then they trashed it and that kept people, you know, I didn't I decided I wasn't going
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.920]   to watch it because of all the bad buzz about it.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.120]   And they probably lost me as a viewer.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:43.360]   One of the interesting things about binging versus watching episodically is that I think,
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.120]   particularly with Netflix, the show creators, when they know it's going to be all dumped
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:58.240]   at once, change the structure of the shows so that you don't have necessarily a big cliffhanger
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:03.200]   at the end of the show, it just ends and then there's credits for the new episode and then
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.800]   it just picks up in the same scene sometimes.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:11.480]   The whole structure and the way they film it and then edit it changes when it's designed
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.720]   to be benched.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.280]   I've got an example for that.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.280]   I love two shows, Star Trek the Next Generation and the Expanse.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.480]   Right now, those are probably my top two.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.480]   I just did a rewatch of the entire Next Generation when I was back in the States because it's
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.560]   on Amazon Prime.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:33.120]   And I realized I missed like a dozen episodes and I had not realized that I'd miss that
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.200]   because back when they were first on TV, I had skipped a week or two and it didn't
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.840]   affect the story.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.400]   If I skipped an episode of the Expanse, there would be a huge plot hole.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.600]   So that's the difference between episodic and binge-worthy shows.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:54.280]   Well, also, I have a short-term memory problem and so if I don't watch this one or the other,
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.720]   I end up going, "Who's that?
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720]   What happened?
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.720]   Why is he there?
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.840]   I thought he was dead."
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.920]   So that's another problem.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.480]   I wonder if bad movies do better in a streaming environment or worse.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.520]   Wonder Woman came out of the gate doing very well but in the second weekend, the box office
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:17.840]   went down 67% and I have to think that it's a lot of people like you, Dwight, who saw the
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.760]   reviews and said, "Well, I guess I'm not watching that."
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.320]   Even though in the US, it's free.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.760]   It doesn't cost you anything to watch it.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.440]   It costs you your time.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:33.040]   I mean, I could be watching Ma Rainey's Black Bottom on Netflix just fantastic.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.760]   And Chadwick Bozeman is just incredible.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.760]   I love it.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.760]   I love it.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:47.440]   I mean, there's a scene where he takes over and I'd say for 10 minutes, he's riveting.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.280]   And when it's done, you realize you've been holding your breath that whole time.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.680]   It's an amazing movie.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:57.560]   Especially knowing now that he was riddled with cancer and knew he was probably going
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.560]   to die.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.960]   It was his last or second or last movie.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.520]   Yeah, it's very sad.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.440]   Yeah, I mean Wonder Woman is two and a half hours long.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.760]   That's nearly three episodes of Peaky Blinders.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.760]   It's just like...
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.560]   How many dairy girls is that?
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:16.840]   That's nearly a season of dairy girls.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.040]   I binge Peaky Blinders.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.840]   I binged billions.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.400]   Great show.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.400]   I feel like...
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.320]   I have to say though, I feel like we've reached the bottom of the barrel.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320]   I've watched everything.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.160]   I finally did watch "Schitt's Creek."
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.400]   And that's pretty good.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.400]   So I'm not...
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.400]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   Yeah, I'm not completely out of things to watch.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.360]   But now you're going to make me watch "The Expanse."
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.840]   I wanted to read it before I watched it.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.080]   You haven't seen it?
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.080]   No.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.080]   Leo.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   No.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.720]   I have the books too and I was going to read those.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.240]   I just haven't gotten around to it.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.240]   Should I...
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.520]   Stop the show and go watch it.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520]   Really that good.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.520]   Yep.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.520]   I've watched the...
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.520]   Okay, confession.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.280]   I've watched the first episode a couple of times.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.680]   And it didn't really grab me, which is why I didn't go on.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   But I'm going to...
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:02.680]   It's a slow burn.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.680]   Slow burn.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.680]   But it's really good.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   All right.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.000]   It had issues in season three, but seasons one and two are a unit.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.080]   Incredible.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.200]   And season four just blew me away.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.040]   Season five I'm waiting for.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.440]   And supposedly season six is the last, at least the last on Amazon.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.680]   Right.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   So...
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.680]   Have you read the books?
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.600]   Oh yeah, of course.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.600]   Read the book first.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.600]   We had the author on the network.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   I know.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.600]   I know.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   Read the book first.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600]   Read the...
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600]   Watch the show.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.600]   Watch the show.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.600]   Watch the show.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.600]   Watch the show.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   Watch the show.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.600]   Watch the show.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600]   I had the books.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.600]   That's unusual.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.360]   Yeah, usually with sci-fi, I don't...
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.000]   I want to read the book always because...
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.760]   Well, the authors are involved in the making of the show.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.760]   Right.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.640]   So they're not like out of the loop.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:55.400]   So I had the show runner several months ago for a column about the hand terminals that
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:01.120]   they use and kind of that as the future of smartphones.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:07.120]   And I have so much material from that interview about kind of the creation of it.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.160]   I may end up later on going back and doing a second piece because it was just really
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.160]   good.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.160]   All right.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.160]   I guess I have some as an assignment tonight.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.360]   Here's a little story.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:22.680]   One of the things that they do that makes expanse so good is they've actually spent a
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:29.120]   lot of time figuring out how you would move when the ships or the stations are in zero
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.640]   G or not.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640]   And they actually...
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.880]   They have notes in the readings that say, "Okay, this is zero G.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.960]   This is not.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.920]   This is the orientation of the camera."
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.720]   So they've actually figured it out, said that they're not cheating.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.080]   There is no anti-gravity.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.320]   There is no transporter.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.120]   There's no easy way to get from ship to ship without going through an airlock.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.240]   And it's little details like that that if you know about space and if you know about
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.680]   space technology, it's like an inside joke to you.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.680]   It's amazing.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.000]   A lot of CGI.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.960]   Yes.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.960]   But you can't tell.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.960]   You can't tell.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.960]   Okay.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.960]   And so...
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.960]   Lately, that's been turning me off.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.880]   It really turned me off in Wonder Woman 84.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880]   No, this is just CGI.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.080]   CGI was visible and it really was distracting to go, "Oh, yeah.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.000]   She's on a green stage right now."
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.640]   Well, that's because they rendered it on a PS2.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.120]   By the way, how does the Holy Father like his PS5?
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.640]   Is he enjoying it?
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:32.880]   Yeah, but Cyberpunk 2077 was really messing up, so he's a little checked.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.720]   Oh, I hate it when that happens.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.840]   You get all excited about a game and then...
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.840]   Oh, that's just...
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.160]   Oh, come on, Leo.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.360]   You know, the Pope is a PC gamer.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   He doesn't do consoles.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.120]   You know, and he only plays soccer games.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.040]   He only plays FIFA over and over and over again, I know.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   Flight simulator.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.200]   Actually, that was the one thing...
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.400]   Of all the things Google did in 2020, the one thing that actually worked was Stadia with
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400]   Cyberpunk 2077.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:07.880]   It was the only way to play that game, which is bizarre.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.360]   And I'm not sure, I guess you need so much horsepower, you need the Google Cloud to play
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.560]   Cyberpunk 2077.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.200]   It wasn't too bad on a PC.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.240]   A PC was okay, it was just on the consoles, and especially the old...
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.800]   I think it was already a PS5 as well.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.000]   It ran on the PC until the game-breaking glitches started coming out.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   Right, right.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   So, you know...
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.320]   I hear the Pope likes the flight simulator.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.840]   He just likes to fly around.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.080]   No, no, no, he's a big fan of...
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.000]   Do you remember that game for the Atari bus?
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   Yeah, it was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   Literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   It was literally a tried-for-checker.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   It was just a tried-for-checker.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   It was just a tried-for-checker.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   It was just a tried-for-checker.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   It was just a tried-for-checker.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   What Penn and Teller wanted to design the worst game ever.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   What they didn't expect was that people would actually play it and enjoy it.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   This is actually probably more exciting than CES Virtual is going to be.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   Let me put a quarter in this box.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   Let me put a quarter in.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   Here we go.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   Desert bus.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   Hey, it's better than the organ trails.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   You played simulator.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   You'll be a diet of just playing.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   Let's just jump right to the exciting part.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   Here we go.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   It's Minecraft.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   That's it.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   That's it.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   That's it.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   That's it.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   Oh, great.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   Oh.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   Sorry, anybody who explains about mod confusing game should be made to play that for three hours.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   The graphics are so remarkable.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   I love my Mint Mobile iPhone SE.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   I got such a deal on it.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   That's really what's cool about Mint Mobile.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   All this year, after everything we've been through, saving money has got to be at the top of everyone's resolution list.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   Why are you paying 70, 80, 90, $100 a month for wireless service?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   What are you doing?
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   Switch to Mint Mobile.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   It's the easiest way to save.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   The next plan started just $15 a month.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   I'm not just, you know, do you get for $15 a month unlimited nationwide talk and text and high-speed data on the nation's largest 5G network?
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   It's a great way to get premium wireless as little as $15 a month.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   How do they do it?
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   Well, they're online only.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   They don't have to pay for stores.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   Eliminating the cost of retail means they can pass significant savings on to you.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   And by the way, if you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered with their 7-day money-back guarantee.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   I actually ended up going for the $25 a month plan, which is 12 gigabytes of high-speed 5G data plus unlimited nationwide talk and text.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   That's an amazing deal for a third of what I'm paying for the same service from T-Mobile.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   To get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month and get the plan shipped to your door free, go to mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   Thank you, Mint Mobile.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   Let's see.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   This was a very sad, sad New Year's Eve for me because we had to say goodbye to two of my bestest friends, Farmville and Flash.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   They kind of went together, didn't they?
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   I feel like they're buried in the same grave.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   Adobe killed Flash finally.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   And Farmville, which was based on Flash, I guess it kind of had to go along with it.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   Did any of you play Farmville? I was badly addicted.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   I never got into it because I recognized immediately that that's the kind of game that would destroy my life.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   Yeah, and you were right.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   Yeah, I did it for a couple of months and then I realized I was spending way too much time doing it.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   But honestly saying goodbye to Farmville and Flash, they...
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   It's just kill it.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   Just kill it.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   Yeah, I got so sick on Patch Tuesday as a writing story is about this is the latest critical vulnerability in Flash.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   No, no, this one's even bigger.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   Oh, God, Flash was a nightmare, just a nightmare.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   But Farmville was a nightmare in its own way too.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   I spent a lot of time farming corn.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   I remember one morning my wife got up, she said, "What are you doing?"
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   I said, "You're farming, aren't you?" I said, "Yeah."
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   Why don't you knit a sweater? At least you'd have something at the end of the day.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   And it's really true. I really recognize.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   But I have a weakness because after Farmville, I played Wii Rule after Wii Rule, Simpson's tapped out.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   And now I'm doing Animal Crossing and I find I'm doing the same damn farming on Animal Crossing.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   It's the same thing.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   Of course you are.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   The formula works, Leo. Of course they're going to do it again and again and again and again.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   And there are sequels to Farmville you could still play, right?
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   That aren't based on Flash.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   There are still farm, you know, farmville, too.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   The sequels are called Animal Crossing and--
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   Yeah, I just described them all.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   I think this was probably, for most of us, our first experience of dark patterns and evil addictions.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   And I know that I always know with one of these games that I played it too much when I'm no longer enjoying it.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   First of the first few weeks you enjoy it, it's fun.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   But when you kind of grit your teeth and go, "Oh, I got up. I got up."
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   That corn's going to go bad if I don't harvest it.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   And you fire the thing up and you're just like, "Why am I doing this to myself?"
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   The Sims was the same way.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   The Sims and Sims City, your city would decline, your Sims would die, and sometimes you get sadistic and you would want to kill your Sims, you know, slowly.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   And so there's a lot of games like that where you cannot stop, and if you do stop, something dies.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   Yeah, actually in Animal Crossing, if you don't play, your house gets filled with cockroaches and spider--
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   I'm not kidding.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   In spider webs, your crops rot, and you can go in and clean it up and start over.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   But your neighbors, because you have other people on your island, are their animals on your island, apparently they're a little cross with you.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   Because you haven't been there in a while.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   Coming back to what you were saying about Dark Patterns, Leo, I thought that was interesting that Farmville and Facebook both really took off at around the same time because they played onto each other's strengths.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   And yeah, you'll constantly check in Facebook and, "Oh, Mezwilcek on how my farm is doing in the meantime."
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   But yeah, I mean, as Dwight says, it goes way back to the Sims.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   You could possibly even take it back further.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   If you left civilization running when you were in the screen, you would come back and find Bob Berry.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   And you'd say, "Boutour Goose."
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   Farmville was named by Time Magazine in 2010 as one of the 50 worst inventions of all time.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   I just want to go with that.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   Well, I mean, it's exactly the cycle of addiction.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   Addiction starts off with you do something because it makes you feel good.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   Then you do something because you feel bad if you don't do it.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   Then you feel bad even if you do it.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   That's exactly Farmville and Facebook.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Yeah. There really is something to be said.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   And maybe I should have seen this more of as a larger warning about Facebook way back when.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   Because I honestly feel like Facebook is pretty much just Farmville.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   It's digital crack.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   But I mean, this has been going on for quite some time.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   I mean, if you go back to the '80s, I mean, Elite was one of the first games that really crippled people in terms of addiction.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   The BBC decided to do a news story on Elite because the news editor came in and found nine hours of 20 of his journalists were playing it.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000]   And the others were asking them how to get on as well.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   Wow.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   So, you know, it's these things that computer software, you know, computer games and narcotics have an awful lot in common.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   And they're increasingly designed to hit those same pleasure centers.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   It's really good. How many hours of productivity have been killed simply by Microsoft?
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   I hate to think about it.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   Oh, not on Mindo.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   Or Minds.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   I have to ask, is probably the most.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   How many donuts did you buy?
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   Oh, a lot.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   But the thing that really frosted my corn flakes was at one point, my Simpsons tapped out town crashed.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   And I had a credit for $300 worth of donuts still.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   [laughter]
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   But my town crashed and I lost everything in the great crash of probably 2015.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   And you'd think I'd have learned a lesson.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   At least with Animal Crossing, there's no more to buy.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   So they just did dick you for no good reason not to make money just because they can more than anything else, which is kind of sad.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   Very good article in The New Republic by Siva Vaajanathan, who is a sociologist and wrote a book about Facebook.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   The article I recommend to everybody is making sense of the Facebook menace and the largest media platform in the world ever be made safe for democracy.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   There's a fairly long article describing the issues with Facebook and then trying to come up with some solutions.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   What do you do with Facebook?
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   You don't want the government to shut them down.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   You certainly don't want them to be split up and it just creates more Facebooks.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   It's like a Hydra.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   The greatest threat, this is the paragraph I thought was important and really is timely.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   Perhaps the greatest threat that Facebook poses in concert with other, by the way, he points out other digital media platforms, devices, and the whole global media ecosystem is corrosion over time.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   What Facebook does or does not amplify or delete in the moment matters very little.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   He's talking about what Facebook blocks and whether this should be allowed or that.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   He says, "That doesn't matter in a diverse and tumultuous world, but the fact that Facebook, the leading player in the global media ecosystem undermines our collective ability to distinguish what is true or false, who or what should be trusted, and our abilities to deliberate soberly across differences and distances is profoundly corrosive.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   This is the gaping flaw in the platform's design that will demand much more radical interventions than better internal policies or even aggressive antitrust enforcement."
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   I feel like that's true.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   He talks about something.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   I think it's true, but you could also say it's true about Fox News, for example.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   No, no, he's in fact saying that.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   He's saying it's the global media.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   He says, "Really, Facebook is a part of a larger global media ecosystem that has had over the last…"
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   I think a lot of it's because of the internet, maybe cable news, but just this… we were inundated constantly with information, and the upshot of it is it's no longer…
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   we were no longer able to distinguish good from bad, useful from not useful, trustworthy versus not trustworthy.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   It's just a massive information that we don't have any biological way to process.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   We talk about this a lot of…
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   We're not inundated by information.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   That's the problem.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   We're inundated by advertising.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   We're inundated by catchphrases.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   We are inundated by this desire to have with over depth, because depth doesn't sell.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   If you say, "I'm going to spend the next hour teaching you everything you need to know about Brexit, nobody will tune in."
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   If you give them five soundbites that they can use at a dinner party, they'll tune in every single time you broadcast.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   Well, and…
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   No, that's exactly right.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   That's exactly right.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   And of course, because of the very fast, powerful feedback loops that technology has created, everybody who creates content knows that, and knows pretty well about what it is that creates that.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   And so there's no incentive to create long form boring pieces that nobody's going to read.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   Well, this is something that came out of the Brexit investigations into social media, was that social media wasn't necessarily being used to change people's minds directly with targeted advertising.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   What they were doing was testing out various keywords and key phrases to see what really got people fired up, and then spamming those out across the entire populace.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   So, you know, make Britain free again, and regain control and the rest of it.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   These were all put out to various different social groups and sociological types before being spammed out in a general thing.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   So, you're right, people are absolutely using this to push their message, but they're just doing it in a very, very efficient way, and I think therein lies the problem.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   The algorithm is the problem, whether it's a computer algorithm or a human algorithm, because there certainly is…
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   You probably experienced this, Dwight, pressure to create articles that people click on.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:10.000]   Sure. You mentioned the whole idea of no one's going to pay any attention to being told for an hour about Brexit, but they will if it's entertaining.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   And you could have depth in it be entertaining that is hard to do, but you could do it.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   And so, I think that what's happened is that people have insisted on having essentially icing on everything, icing on your steak, basically.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   You've got to be able to.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   You have to be able to make something palatable and entertaining.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   There's a really interesting book, and some of his theories are referenced in this by Neil Postman.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   He's mentioned in that a book called "Amusing Ourselves to Death."
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   Excellent.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.000]   And it was written in the era of television, but a lot of it applies to now.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   Well, he was a harbinger of what was to come.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000]   Right.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   He was great.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   He didn't even…
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   I mean, he had no idea how bad it was going to get.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   [laughter]
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]   Hey, good news for Tesla.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   They said they would deliver half a million vehicles in 2018, and they did in 2020.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]   [laughter]
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   That's still a lot of electric vehicles, 499,550.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   Hello, Tuit.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   Hi, nice to see you.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   Good to see you.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   [laughter]
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   Anything to say about that?
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   Elon Musk, is he still the second richest man in the world?
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   He's certainly the most bizarre man in the world.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000]   I do worry.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   I do worry.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   He gets into Grimes' stash a bit too often, although she might have pulled back.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   I mean, look, Tesla, Elon is wonderful in many ways.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   He's revolutionized rocket transport, major electric cars sexy, but there's a German word
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   whose name escapes me.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000]   He's someone who is brilliant in one area and a complete nincompooping another.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   That's it?
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   That's the word.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   I need that word.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000]   Idiot Savant?
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   No, he's not Idiot Savant, though, exactly.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   No.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   But, you know, he's now a Texan.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   Yes, he's moved.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   He lives here.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   He has to earn his boots.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   But he's…
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   Yeah, he's…
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   Supposedly, he's shacked up somewhere in Austin.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.000]   I don't think he's going to buy a place, and I think he's going to be kind of a mobile
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   billionaire.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.200]   He spends a lot of time down in Boca Chica, where that's where the starship is being
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   worked on.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:37.000]   But, yeah, he's now a Texan, which just blows my mind.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   The German word you are looking for is…
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   Fafasciidiot.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   Fafasciidiot.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   Fafasciidiot.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   What?
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000]   F-A-C-H-I-D-I-O-T.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   It means a high-distance field specialist who's an idiot in another area.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000]   Yes.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   I mean, it's…
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000]   Although…
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   I mean, Dwight, Texas is now preparing for an influx of tech firms on one level.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000]   I mean, HPE is moving over there.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   Oracle is moving over there.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   Now, Ariella Sten isn't.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   He's going to just hang out in his private Hawaiian island and let the peons go.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   How is that going to work?
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.480]   You know, what's interesting is that Texas has already had kind of an influx of tech
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:24.240]   talent and expansion, particularly in Austin, less so in Houston.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.480]   I will have…
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.680]   I probably will run later in January after I'm gone.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:36.080]   I just did an interview with Michael Dell that will run in our Monday business publication.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.560]   That's exactly…
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:41.280]   And one of the things that he told me, and this isn't really news because everybody
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:46.240]   knows it, but he hears from a lot of technology companies who are interested in moving to
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.760]   Texas.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.760]   And that is…
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:49.760]   Can I just say, though…
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:51.760]   …I'm cynical.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:55.720]   Does it have anything to do with the lack of a state income tax?
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.080]   I don't think that's a cynical reason.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.280]   I think that's the reason.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.280]   I think it's more…
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.280]   It's cheaper to do business here…
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:06.120]   Well, you get to keep more of your money.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:12.360]   Yes, and also it's cheaper salaries are lower, land costs are lower.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.640]   So it's just a classic capitalist move.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:16.640]   Yes.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:17.640]   Yes.
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.640]   But you noticed there's an entire…
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:25.720]   In both HP's and Oracle statements, none of them mention tax, none of them mention salary
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.720]   levels.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:31.360]   It's all about increasing the opportunities for more flexible working for our employees
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.240]   and all the bullshit that you've come to expect from a corporate press department.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.880]   But that really is what it's about.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.880]   It's about money.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.120]   It's not about policy of life.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.120]   And they're also…
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.560]   It's also a right to work state, right?
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.560]   So you can't use it.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.560]   Right.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:49.680]   So I interviewed the CEO of HPE.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:53.560]   And one of the things he said, you know, yes, the cost of…
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:57.320]   Cost of doing business is better, is lower in Texas.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:03.400]   The one downside to it is, probably the biggest downside, is that while in Austin you certainly
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:10.280]   have a critical mass of talent, in other parts of the state you may not.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.080]   Houston, you are growing that more and more.
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:18.200]   It's probably the most diverse crop of talent in the state in Houston.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.200]   But it is a…
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.920]   You have to get that critical mass here that you have now in Silicon Valley before I think
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:27.840]   you really have a lot of people moving.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.880]   The thing is, it's not sustainable.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.440]   We know it's not sustainable because we've seen this pattern over and over again.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.520]   You get that critical mass.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.080]   You attract all these companies.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.760]   Eventually you have to start raising the quality of life across the city, which means
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:46.600]   you have to increase the taxes or start charging taxes in order to pay for everything.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.760]   At that point, these companies will up and go someplace else.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:55.080]   Well, what's also really interesting is that in the Texas legislature, which is controlled
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:33:01.880]   by the GOP and all of the top leaders of the state, the lieutenant governor, the governor,
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:06.560]   or the attorney general, are all very conservative Republicans.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:10.960]   They all warn about the Californiaization of Texas.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:17.960]   And in fact, in the upcoming legislature, there is a lot of talk about reducing the
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:22.080]   local control that states and counties have because they're doing things, they want to
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:25.520]   do things that look suspiciously like California.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   Of course.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:32.640]   But what's going to happen is you have more and more of these companies here who expect
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:38.280]   that level of service and that level of amenity from their government.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.880]   But they're not paying for it.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.680]   They're not paying for it.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.680]   They're not paying for it.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.360]   Well, I mean, my son is going to change taxes.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:51.840]   And I don't think the, you're going to have a reckoning at some point.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:56.120]   I mean, my understanding is that Austin, for example, has just as big a homeless problem
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:00.480]   with San Francisco, it's just shifted further out into the suburbs.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.040]   And sooner or later, people are going to be saying, well, hang on, I left drug addicted
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.840]   homeless people in San Francisco.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.840]   I went to Austin.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.520]   I've still got them sooner or later.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:12.080]   We're going to have to pay to clean this stuff up.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.080]   Come to Houston.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.080]   I mean, oh, come on.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.920]   I've been to, I went to Houston in the compact days and lovely people, but the climate's
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.800]   an absolute killer.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.120]   I mean, even in February, the humidity rates was in the 80s.
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:28.440]   And you just, you can't survive without air conditioning there.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.600]   Did you grow up in Houston?
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.600]   No, you got out.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.320]   Are you there because that's where you have always lived or?
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:40.640]   I have always lived in the South, but I've lived most of my adult life in Texas and all
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.040]   of my adult life in Texas and most of it in Houston.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:53.000]   And the climate is what it is, as we say, and air conditioning is everywhere and air conditioning
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.360]   is just a fact of life.
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:02.640]   And so, you know, you kind of, the one thing about Houston that kind of has more issues
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:07.360]   now is that we increasingly, we've been having these storms that cause horrendous flooding.
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.160]   You've come that up all over us.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160]   All of the change.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:16.800]   And I think that as much as city leaders and the greater Houston partnership, which is
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:24.560]   what we call the Chamber of Commerce here, is as much as they want to spin it, that, you
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.120]   know, Houston has a great quality of life.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.040]   It has a great quality of life until there's 30 inches of water in your front yard.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.040]   Yes.
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.920]   But we have short memories for disasters, right?
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.680]   Trust me, this place is going to burn down one summer.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:43.640]   And it's just going to be, oh, yeah, didn't we have wildfires last year and the year before?
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.640]   And the year before?
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:50.000]   Well, I mean, we had two earthquakes here in down at the Bay Area on New Year's, on New
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000]   Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.640]   Oh, they made little, little, little, some kind of like 3.6.
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.920]   You don't even wake up for 3.0.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:56.920]   No, no, no, no.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.680]   So locals, that is basically, oh, the next door neighbor has just dropped something.
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.520]   But, you know, as someone who didn't grow up with this, it was just an after 20.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.040]   Oh, where did you get a real one, Ian?
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.200]   And then you can talk.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.800]   You get a nice, a good, a nice 7 or 8.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.960]   You're going to, it's so weird because you don't expect things are moving that shouldn't
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:16.960]   be.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.280]   My boss was here in, in 89 for the, for the big one there.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:27.520]   And he, he saw something he'd never seen before, which was shot front plate glass windows flexing
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.520]   in and out.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:29.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.000]   And it was just like, okay, maybe moving out here wasn't.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.480]   That's disorienting.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.240]   That's really disorienting because the ground isn't supposed to move.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.240]   It's supposed to be solid.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.240]   Or elevated freeways that wobbled.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.240]   I've seen video of that.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.240]   Oh, I've been, I was there.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.880]   Somebody who's, I'm sorry, after you.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.080]   No, no, go ahead, please.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:55.080]   Oh, no, I spoke to somebody who's locally male pub and she was upon a crane, you know,
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.720]   one of those tall cranes in 89.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.920]   And she's like, if I hadn't have been strapped in, I would have been thrown out of this thing
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.200]   because we were swaying, you know, meat on either side or feet as she would have said
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:11.760]   and freedom, you know, on either side, it's just, but everywhere has natural disasters.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.680]   You saw something California and the West Coast has its earthquakes, Japan has them as
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.840]   well.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.720]   You know, China has killing smog.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.720]   There's no weather.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.720]   It's perfect.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.800]   And that's basically the climate is not getting any better in the short term.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:29.040]   So, you know, make doing my mom was in the Trans America building and the building continued
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.640]   to sway for about six or seven minutes.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.800]   Well, it's designed to though.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:35.600]   That's why it's a good place to be because it's on rollers, believe it's supposed to
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.600]   move.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.240]   You don't want a building that doesn't move because then what happens is it breaks.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.240]   It cracks.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:46.920]   Well, it's like, if you've seen the what's the twin towers in Malaysia?
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.640]   You know, the one's all cool.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:49.640]   Oh, cool.
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.600]   There they've got a massive counterweight.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.400]   And you just watch it sway in earthquakes and it's awe-inspiring, but it's not really a
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.320]   solution which you have everywhere.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.760]   Let's take a little break.
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:08.680]   We'll have a final segment with this nice panel who is put up with me because there's
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.040]   nothing to talk about.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.920]   I'll find I'll find some news.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:20.400]   Father Robert Ballis there, the digital Jesuit from his no drinking father, his professional
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.720]   podcast studio, high a top Vatican City.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:26.160]   How what foot floor are you on up there?
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.760]   Actually, this is this is my studio one studio five is on the roof.
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.040]   This is down in the bowels.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.000]   Excuse me.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.080]   So are you in the catacombs?
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.080]   Kind of actually.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.280]   Yeah, it is a bit maze-like down here.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.280]   Wow.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:46.800]   This is typically the studio we use for multi-person recording, but I had to move all the equipment
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.120]   down when I went back to the United States and I had a chance to move back up.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.120]   Nice.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.120]   Nice.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]   It's still a beautiful studio.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.720]   The lighting, everything, the sound quality.
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:56.720]   It's great.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.720]   I do like it.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:00.120]   Yeah, you do a great job.
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.960]   I'm not sure if you're from the hair.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:06.840]   You know, I was going to say you're either your hair got more curly or the wig is not
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.840]   doing well in the humidity.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:10.760]   I'm not sure which is six months, six months.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.520]   Oh, look at you.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.960]   We don't get a barber here for another week.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.320]   Oh, or as they say, Barbieri.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.320]   I call him Vincenzo.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.280]   Vincenzo, you'll Barbieri.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.080]   His name is not Vincenzo.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.720]   But it's good to call him that.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.000]   It was a bothersome, does it?
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000]   Podcasting from a cephalicure, it's Father Robert Balissaire.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.120]   Also with us podcasting from his temporary home at the Houston Chronicle, surrounded
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:45.000]   by blankets, it's which is the last thing he'd even used and I would guess Dwight Silverman,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.560]   Houston Chronicle.com/
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.640]   In the end of the podcasting studio that we have here on the on the third floor, probably
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:57.200]   the last time I'll be in here because I'm out of here on the 15th with Forbes on the
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.200]   first.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.200]   That's exciting.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.640]   Now, you're going to be working remotely.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.240]   You don't have to go to the Forbes.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.400]   No, no, no.
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:11.160]   And there's no, there's no at the moment expectation for me to travel.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:17.880]   Although I suspect that once we have a real CES possibly next year, I may be expected
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.880]   to go to the end.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.400]   But I could do it out of Houston.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.080]   That's all me at CES next year.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.440]   You don't have to go Ian, but everybody let's all meet.
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.680]   I'd go for a meeting.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.960]   For that, wouldn't that be fun?
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.960]   I would totally go.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:28.960]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.000]   I would just like to see y'all.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.360]   I'll be wearing a mask.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:37.680]   Maybe I'll be wearing a full bodysuit with a blower in the back, but I'll be there.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:42.320]   Well, actually you say that there was, did you hear about the outbreak they've had down
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.320]   in?
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.320]   I think it's San Jose at Kaiser.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.320]   Yes.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.920]   And that was traced back to somebody wearing those one of those inflatable Tyrannosaurus
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.720]   things while having COVID.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:55.960]   And the fan was blowing this all apart everywhere else.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:59.680]   It's about as bad as you can get.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.680]   I just imagine this inflatable Tyrannosaurus, actually was it a Christmas tree?
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.200]   It was an inflatable...
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.640]   It was hardly sure, but yeah.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.200]   Yeah, inflatable something.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:14.520]   And I think 43 people got emergency room staff got infected.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:21.320]   And I feel so bad for them because they were wearing, I'm sure, PPE and all of that stuff.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:23.960]   You know, every time they went in the ward and all that.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.280]   And then they're having a little Christmas party and some dope inflatable Christmas tree
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.920]   blows COVID all over them.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:31.920]   It's terrible.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.320]   It was a homemade virus dispersal device.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:37.440]   Exactly.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.440]   You couldn't...
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:41.440]   So stupid.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.800]   Ian Thompson is also here from the register.com.
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.520]   He used to be the register.go.uk.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:46.880]   I try to get people when they're drinking.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.600]   This is my new thing.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:49.600]   The register.com.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:50.600]   It's a tea-only...
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.040]   The delicious tea.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.440]   I have a drum afterwards.
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.320]   Oh, that's good.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.720]   That's good.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:01.520]   We will talk about drone because we've got the new drone regulations because we've got
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:04.280]   the drone father here, the quad father.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:06.960]   But first a word from our sponsor, ExpressVPN.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.200]   Somebody asked me here the other day on the radio show.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.200]   I don't go anywhere.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.360]   What do I need a VPN for?
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.200]   I said, "Yeah, no, it's true."
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:18.680]   When we first started using VPNs, it's when we realized that every time we use an open
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:23.080]   Wi-Fi access point at the coffee shop or at the airport, we were on a network with other
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:24.080]   people.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.920]   We didn't know that they could be...
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.280]   They see what we were doing, but also the people who provided the access point, they could
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:31.440]   see everything we were doing.
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:34.800]   It seemed only prudent to have a VPN.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:37.240]   And that's really when VPNs started to take off.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.400]   But it's also the case that even when you're home, a VPN is a great way to protect your
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:48.480]   privacy, to keep you secure, but also keep the information about what you're doing away
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.920]   from here in that service provider.
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.240]   The guy said, "Yeah, but I use incognito mode."
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.240]   I said, "That only hides.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:56.200]   That doesn't hide you from anything.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:59.960]   That only just doesn't keep a history."
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.440]   That's not privacy.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.680]   You need an encrypted VPN.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:09.000]   Plus there's the thing that we've all gone through where we've watched every Netflix show
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000]   available to us.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.320]   Wouldn't it be nice if you could watch Netflix in the UK and see all those Doctor Who episodes
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.360]   or Netflix in Tokyo and see all the anime episodes?
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.800]   Well, you can with ExpressVPN.
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:27.200]   Now remember, a VPN is only as good as the company providing it.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:33.120]   Your privacy and your security are protected with ExpressVPN because they care about you
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:35.600]   and they make sure that they do not log you.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:41.360]   In fact, they even invented a server technology they call Trusted Server that runs in RAM-only
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.840]   sandbox so it can't write to the hard drive.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.400]   And the minute you close the VPN connection, it disappears and there's no trace of your
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.400]   presence.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:52.920]   And we know that's the case because they get regular audits from PricewaterhouseCooper.
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.680]   So we know that they are not tracking you, that you are private.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:03.600]   Now of course there are free and very cheap VPNs out there but it costs money to run
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.600]   a good VPN.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:09.840]   If you want a VPN that's fast, that lets you emerge anywhere in the world, that lets
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.600]   you watch HD video, it's going to cost you a little bit.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:18.300]   I think ExpressVPN is a great deal around $7 a month and it does it without slowing down
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:19.580]   your connection.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:22.960]   It does it without logging your presence.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:28.440]   It gives you true privacy, true security and oh by the way, Dr. Who episodes from the
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.040]   UK Netflix.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:34.520]   It's the number one rated VPN, not just by me but by CNET, by Wired.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:37.480]   They do everything right.
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:42.600]   Stop handing your personal data over to ISPs and other tech giants who mine your activity,
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.840]   sell off your information.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.000]   I put ExpressVPN on the router.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.600]   That way everybody in the house is protected.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:54.080]   Check yourself with a VPN I trust to keep me private and secure online.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:57.800]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:01.800]   eXPR ESS VPN.com/twit.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.760]   We're going to get you the best deal.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.000]   When you sign up for the 12 month plan, you'll get an extra three months free.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.200]   That's like a 25% discount.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.280]   That really is the best way to do this.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:14.120]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:21.000]   I trust them.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.040]   We are going to get back to the news such as it is in just a second but before we do.
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:30.080]   I do want to take a look back because this was an interesting week and we've made a little
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.080]   video for you.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.080]   I hope you enjoy it.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.080]   Watch.
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.320]   This is what the robots are going to look like when they dance on our.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.320]   Oh good.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:38.320]   I'm glad I didn't play this on the show.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.680]   Gee, that is an appropriate comment.
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:44.480]   There's also a wall between them and the humans.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:48.080]   I don't think that's by accident.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:51.120]   Previously on Twit.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.560]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:56.240]   In many ways, this was a banner year for Apple.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:05.560]   I mean they ended the year with a release of new computers that just changed everything.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.560]   Hands on tech.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:12.440]   It is time to go hands on with the three big $99 smart speakers.
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:15.040]   You've got the HomePod Mini.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.800]   You've got the Echo 4th generation.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:22.200]   You've got the Nest Audio.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:26.800]   It is time to talk speakers.
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.440]   All about Android.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:31.080]   It's the end of year, year in review.
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.320]   That's right 2020.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.320]   What a year it's been.
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:40.040]   We walked you through all of the biggest Android news, hardware, disappointments and our favorite
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.040]   apps of the year.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.080]   This year I could not put down the Note 20 Ultra 5G.
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.640]   I could not put down the Z Fold 2 when I had it.
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:48.760]   I could not put down my Z Flip.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.600]   Like seriously Samsung, what is happening?
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:54.120]   I want to hate you so much yet I can't.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.960]   Like you're doing it right.
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:56.960]   Twit.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:57.960]   We're doing it so right Samsung.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.440]   Oh, you're a jeez.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:01.400]   Wishing you a happy new year.
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:07.400]   I don't know if you've been following this father rubber, but I know you are what we call
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:12.080]   you the quad father, a big drone fan.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:17.560]   What rules have been changed now with the FAA?
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:18.560]   Right.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:23.920]   So if you've got anything that's less than 250 grams, which would be a lot of the hobbyist
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:28.960]   craft, the toys, the little racers that have FPV, there's no change.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:31.760]   You can still run those any way you want.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:37.000]   They've basically built the new regulations based on how much damage it could cause if
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]   it fell out of the sky.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.120]   Above 250 grams, your craft now has to be running a locator.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:46.200]   Now the original draft was that they wanted you to connect to your phone, which would
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:50.740]   broadcast to a national registry to say that you were flying and where you were flying.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.120]   That got next.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:58.080]   Now all you need is some sort of transmitter on your device that either uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:03.360]   so that anything in the area knows that there's craft in the area.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:06.480]   I think that's the easiest way to sum up all the rules.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.800]   Now as you get bigger and bigger, you start getting into commercial use and that's controlled
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.600]   by the FAA.
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.400]   But they really didn't want to regulate everything because the FAA just doesn't have the manpower
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.400]   to do that.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.400]   So you have a little time.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.960]   The new rules don't take effect for a couple of months.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.960]   Right.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.640]   Drone operators are currently required to obtain a waiver if you want to fly one at night or
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:37.320]   over people who aren't involved in the operation of the drone.
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:42.760]   Drone manufacturers will have 18 months to build these remote ID systems into their drones
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.640]   and then you'll have an additional year to buy one.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.680]   So you've got really in a way you've got two and a half years before you have to worry
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.680]   about this.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680]   Is that right?
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:51.680]   Correct.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:53.680]   And remember, you can retrofit.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:57.560]   You have something right now you can add an ID system to it.
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:02.360]   Also if you let's use DJI since DJI is probably the most popular one out there, everyone's
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:03.440]   seen them.
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:09.120]   If you've got the small ones like the Mavic Airs, they're under 250 grams.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.440]   So this does not apply.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.280]   But if you've got the larger ones that can carry like red cameras, 100% Yeah.
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.280]   That you do have to register.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:20.280]   He's gone into lately FPV.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:22.280]   Hey, that's fun.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.280]   Hey.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:29.880]   He has to wear a VR helmet while he's doing it.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:30.880]   Right.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.280]   So you've got you've got a camera at the front that's broadcasting on a different frequency
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.960]   than the control signal.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:41.720]   And you can see through that camera, through the front of your craft, it's a great way
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:42.720]   to pilot.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.720]   It is a lot of fun.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:48.000]   You get so much more control because rather than you trying to figure out which way your
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.640]   craft is turned and which control input you have to do in order to make it go the way
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:55.400]   you want, it's literally like sitting in a car.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.640]   Now last month DJI, the Chinese manufacturer of the most popular drones, there are many
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.280]   companies, but DJI is one of the biggest, was added to the Department of Commerce's entity
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:14.080]   list saying it's a national security concern and banning US companies from exporting technology
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.880]   to DJI.
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:17.880]   Does that?
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:27.960]   I mean, okay, look, anytime you have a company that is taking your location data, it's going
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.360]   to be a national security risk.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.560]   And that's basically what DJI has been doing.
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.920]   It's so funny because they're on the one hand, the FAA is requiring it.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:36.920]   Correct.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:39.680]   On the other hand, the Commerce Department is saying, Oh, wait a minute, you can't do
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:40.680]   that.
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:41.680]   They're Chinese.
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:42.680]   Mm hmm.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:48.160]   But remember, the only reason why DJI started building that capability into their craft
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:53.480]   was because there was a different set of regulations that came up, what, five years ago?
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.480]   Right.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.480]   We were worried about airports.
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:57.320]   They were required to geo-fence it.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:50:59.320]   Right.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:00.320]   Okay.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:07.160]   So you still be able to buy DJI stuff or the, what does the company say about not being
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160]   able to buy US components?
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.160]   They probably never used them anyway.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:15.320]   I mean, the quote unquote US components are all manufactured over there anyway.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.840]   So yeah, we don't manufacture any drone components here.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:19.840]   Nothing.
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:25.760]   We do some design, but the boards, the auto stabilization technology, the motors, those
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.480]   are all made in China.
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.280]   That's funny.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.280]   How's your Dogecoin doing, by the way?
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:33.880]   I hear it reached a penny.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:39.080]   It said the funny point is it took this long to get to a penny and now all the Dogecoin
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:42.280]   aficionados are saying, okay, next month will be at a dollar.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.280]   No.
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.280]   Doge gone wild.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:49.920]   And it was a meme which you bought into.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:50.920]   How many Dogecoin you have?
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:51.920]   You have millions, right?
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:54.040]   Yeah, I have a million or two.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:56.840]   Well, I had a million or two.
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:58.880]   Well, you sold them?
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:03.760]   I cashed out the vast majority because I had forgotten about them and I put them into
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:09.440]   an exchange and then I moved it over to Bitcoin when Bitcoin was at 13,000.
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:12.640]   It's now, by the way, at 34,000.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:15.120]   Oh, we're into bubble.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:16.880]   No, now it's at 32,000.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.880]   Oh, went back down?
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:20.640]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:21.640]   40.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:31.800]   It's just 33,167.50 as of this moment.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.320]   Is that a bubble?
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:35.160]   What is going on with Bitcoin?
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.160]   I don't know.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:39.880]   A lot of people have been pushing it.
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.240]   Scott Galloway has had a big thing about it.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:46.440]   I do have to wonder what happened to all those mountain gox bitcoins because they're
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:50.400]   worth seriously amount, huge amounts of money at the moment.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:53.560]   But honestly, Bitcoin is a speculative instrument.
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:57.160]   It's not like it's actually used for anything other than holding it and speculating.
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:59.720]   Well, neither's gold.
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:02.040]   What's the industrial value of an ounce of gold?
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:03.760]   It ain't $30,000.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:09.560]   Actually, okay, gold may be, but silver, there's still a severe silver shortage because
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:13.080]   it's best conductor of electricity in the rest of it.
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.080]   Right.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.280]   You can buy things with Bitcoin.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:19.080]   I mean, there are companies that will take them.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.080]   You can.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:26.320]   No, well, there's a luxury car dealer here who kind of touted that he was going to accept
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.320]   Bitcoin for a reason.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:32.480]   I got 7.85 Bitcoin burning a hole in my wallet.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:40.480]   So I put back in 2017 when I did a story on Houston people who were mining Ethereum by
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.160]   buying up graphics cards.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:43.160]   Remember that?
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:48.400]   I put $20 in Bitcoin just so I could have the fun of doing it.
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.880]   And this is what it is now.
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:50.880]   It's at $60.
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:51.880]   $60.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:52.880]   You're rich.
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:53.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:54.880]   You're rich.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:55.880]   Yes.
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:56.880]   I've tripled my money and.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:57.880]   You should have bought more.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:58.880]   Just remember the little people.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:53:59.880]   Just remember the little people.
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:00.880]   I'm also.
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:06.600]   I mean, remember about Bitcoin though is there's always a story about how this business is
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:09.080]   now going to accept Bitcoin or you can buy it.
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:12.960]   It is a terrible device for transactions.
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:16.040]   It is a horrible device for transactions because of the volatility.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:19.040]   It's incredibly clunky.
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.880]   What it is, it's an investment tool.
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:22.880]   It's a financial tool.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:25.240]   It's a way for you to try to grow money.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:31.960]   But trying to buy something with a Bitcoin, going from the actual accepting of the transaction
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:36.680]   to getting the money because that has to go through a financial institution.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:41.440]   You could see, depending on the size of the transaction, several thousands dollars difference
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.720]   either positive or negative.
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:45.320]   That's a horrible way to make a transaction.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:50.040]   Also, I just do want to make this point because I think it's important.
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:55.200]   The amount of power and processing time being used to mine these coins at the moment.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:58.320]   It's the size of a small country.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:00.120]   For all these people, "Oh, I'm so green.
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:03.880]   I'm so environmentally friendly and now I'm mining Bitcoin."
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:06.520]   There is a big carbon footprint to these.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:09.400]   So ethically, it's kind of a dodgy area.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:14.240]   I read somewhere, I suppose it's still true, that the amount of energy used by Bitcoin
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:18.760]   in effect wipes out the net gain of all the solar panels installed.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:21.200]   I can buy for it.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:24.600]   It's just a sign.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.880]   By the way, we have to throw this in here to all the Bitcoin stands.
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:28.880]   I get it.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:29.880]   It's great.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:30.880]   You're at home, you're making money.
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.520]   I'm not knocking that.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:38.360]   We're just explaining the underlying technology and costs of the infrastructure.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:41.960]   If you don't say that, you'll get a lot of angry people saying you don't get it.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.800]   That's a hell with them.
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:47.760]   I've had people saying that to me since the mid-90s.
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:54.440]   Honestly, it could have been so much better.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:59.040]   If you look at what the possibilities were, but it's just become a speculative instrument
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.320]   at the moment as far as I can see.
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:10.440]   And leave it to the Japanese to come up with a solution for space junk.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:15.720]   They're planning to build wooden satellites.
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.400]   You make them out of wood.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:23.680]   This is a Japanese company, Sumitomo Forestry, in conjunction with Kyoto University.
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:31.520]   They hope they will be launching the world's first satellites made out of wood in 2023.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:36.080]   Because of course, the wood burns up when the satellite re-enters.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.400]   But I think you still have to put some electronics in there.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:43.200]   I'm just thinking you can make them out of wood, but you still have to have some circuit
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:45.160]   boards in there, don't you?
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:49.760]   Well, essentially they release this news over the traditional Christmas and New Year
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.200]   slow period.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:55.960]   If you want the satellites to do anything, you can't do it with wood.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:57.960]   You've got to have electronics in there.
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:56:59.760]   Oh, stop your sneeze.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.920]   I do it with wood myself.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:08.200]   I'm a bit of an amateur wood worker.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.200]   Would workers?
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:10.680]   When it comes to...
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:12.920]   I'm not even going there.
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:17.320]   Honestly, when you've got to put stuff into orbit, weight matters.
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:20.560]   Wood is heavier than say very thin aluminium.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.320]   And they both burn up in the atmosphere anyway.
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:26.480]   So it's one of those...
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:28.160]   It's a cute idea.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.160]   But...
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:33.600]   The space jump problem isn't burning up in the atmosphere.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:36.680]   Anything you shove into the atmosphere is going to mostly burn up.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.560]   The problem is when it's orbiting.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:43.840]   And wood or aluminum is going to be traveling at three kilometers per second to stay in
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.600]   a geostationary orbit.
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.560]   And it doesn't matter if it's wood or aluminum.
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:51.120]   If it hits you at that speed, you die.
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:54.600]   If it hits a satellite at that speed, it will destroy that satellite.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:57.000]   So it's not really a solution.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000]   It really isn't.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.800]   It's kind of cute though.
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:00.800]   It is interesting that...
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.400]   It's kind of a bento box satellite.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:12.720]   But I see, I interview Don Kessler about this last year now.
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:19.400]   He came up with the Kessler situation where satellite, satellite, and then we end up blinding
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.400]   it.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.400]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:25.760]   That was the premise for the Great Neil Stevenson novel Seven Eaves.
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:26.760]   Yes.
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:27.760]   And Satterball is gravity.
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:29.760]   And gravity.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:32.680]   Although Neil Stevenson still can't do endings as that book showed.
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:33.680]   But...
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:34.680]   I still like that.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:35.680]   I like that.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:36.680]   Oh yeah.
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:38.760]   But he put out a very...
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:40.760]   This I hadn't realised.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:44.600]   Those stationary satellites aren't pushed back to Earth.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:48.200]   They're pushed out to a parking orbit further out.
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:53.120]   So we're potentially building another band of stuff around us orbit, which is going to
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.480]   come back in haunt us when we actually try and get rid of these things.
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:02.120]   So ideally we need to build space elevators as Arthur C. Clarke would add and build our
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:03.520]   communications around those.
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.320]   But that's a century away.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:06.320]   So...
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:11.720]   But you imagine an alien civilization visiting us in a million years and saying, "They've got
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:13.200]   bamboo in orbit."
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.200]   What the heck of a long...
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:21.920]   It was Neil to cross twice news that his biggest fear was that aliens have visited us, taken
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:22.920]   a look at us.
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:23.920]   They've got...
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.320]   Yeah, we'll come back in 10,000 years when they're not bomb areas.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:28.680]   I totally believe that.
[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:36.240]   There is, I have to say, a signal that has arrived from the Proxima Centauri system.
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:47.160]   And one of their exoplanets, it's very Earth-like, that seems fairly well organized.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:53.840]   Here's from Astronomy Magazine, the best candidate for an extraterrestrial message in 42 years
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:58.640]   is probably man-made, but what if it's not?
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:06.880]   Others heard the signal at the 64-meter Park radio telescope in Australia back in April
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:11.200]   and May of 2019.
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:22.280]   The radio emissions seemed well organized, not spontaneous, not random.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:26.160]   They're analyzing it like crazy right now.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:30.160]   And as is often the case with these kinds of transmissions when they're picked up as it
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:34.320]   could be an Earth bounce or some sort of thing.
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:37.880]   BLC-1, they're dubbing it, "Breakthrough, Listen, Candidate 1."
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:43.080]   Well, it was Arthur C. Clark who said there are two possibilities in life.
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:45.800]   One that we are alone in the universe and one that we're not.
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:48.000]   And both are equally frightening when you really think about it.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000]   It's really true.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000]   Yeah.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.440]   By the way, they've decoded the signal.
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:53.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:58.440]   They've decoded it.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:04.440]   It said, "I am the deposed emperor of Alpha Centauri and I would like to give you $200 million.
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:05.440]   Just give me your banking commission."
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:08.440]   I thought it was going to be level one achieved.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.440]   Would you care to play again?
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:11.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, what a fun game this has been.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:15.440]   I appreciate you helping me pretend that something happened this week in technology.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.440]   Who do we do?
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:17.440]   Ticketmaster.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:19.440]   Oh, what happened with Ticketmaster?
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.440]   Ticketmaster.
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.440]   Ticketmaster got fined.
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:23.440]   $10 million.
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.440]   Oh, they were hacking their guns.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:30.240]   Yeah, one of their senior employees was hacking his former employer.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.600]   And I just love this story because, okay, they would find them $10 million.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:35.920]   But it's Ticketmaster.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.440]   So why not charge them an extra $15 million?
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.440]   It's handling fees.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:41.440]   It's handling fees.
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:42.440]   The convenient fee.
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.440]   The convenient fee.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:44.440]   The convenient fee.
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:45.440]   Yeah.
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.440]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:49.000]   Everyone hates these scumbags.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000]   They are the total worst middle management type.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.840]   Anyway, I just wanted to get that out there because having been shafted by Ticketmaster
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:00.640]   for many years, it's nice to see them get to pay something for a while.
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:06.920]   They repeatedly, according to the Justice Department's settlement, had Ticketmaster employees
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:15.360]   use stolen passwords to gain access to non-public ticketing information from a rival firm.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:17.520]   Songkick.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:23.360]   I guess they hired somebody from Songkick and he had a password.
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.200]   So they were able to log in doing that.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:29.080]   Yeah, you know, it's not.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:30.080]   It happens.
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:32.040]   It's not the nasty attack ever.
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:33.360]   Well, no, it's not.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.640]   You know, when your industrial espionage comes down to I had a password.
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:38.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:39.640]   That's just lazy.
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:40.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:41.640]   Yeah, that's lazy.
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:42.640]   That's lazy.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:44.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, I am lazy.
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:46.360]   I want to go home and watch the expanse.
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.200]   That's what I want to do.
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.200]   Do it.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.200]   Do it.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:51.200]   Do it.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.200]   Do it.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:53.200]   Do it.
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:54.200]   Do it.
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.200]   Do it.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.200]   Do it.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:57.200]   Do it.
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:58.200]   Do it.
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.200]   Do it.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.200]   Do it.
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:01.200]   Do it.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:02.200]   Do it.
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:03.200]   Do it.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:04.200]   Do it.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:05.680]   Thank you Ian Thompson for being here from the register.com.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.680]   A pleasure as ever.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:08.680]   The next time we see you, you will be mustache and mohawk-less.
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:09.680]   Yes, yes, yes.
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.680]   This is coming off in two days time after I've scared the living but Jesus out of the news
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:13.680]   team and then the mustache, I'm going to be cheerfully getting rid of Dwight.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:16.160]   I admire your sattorial choices but I cannot live with this thing anymore.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.760]   It's slightly smaller mustache until it ends up being one of those little Hitler mustaches
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:21.760]   in the middle.
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:26.560]   Well, there was a British comedian who tried to, he spent a year with the Hitler mustaches
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:28.800]   trying to, because Charlie Chaplin wore one of these.
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:29.800]   Sure.
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:30.800]   He was very popular.
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:31.800]   He ruined it.
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:32.800]   It was a very popular style.
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:35.640]   Ah, Hitler's just ruined everything on that front.
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:40.040]   Can you imagine being the Hitler family and it's like, come to Han, it's a happy Hitler's
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.040]   restaurant.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:44.760]   Yeah, you can't even use that name anymore.
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:47.120]   No one's calling their kids adult either, but...
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.520]   Is it called a toothbrush mustache?
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:50.520]   Yes.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:51.520]   Okay.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:52.520]   Yes.
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:53.520]   I thought I heard that but I couldn't...
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:54.520]   That's the name.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.160]   Yeah, it's a toothbrush mustache.
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:57.160]   Yeah.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:58.160]   Yeah.
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:00.520]   Oliver Hardy had one, Charlie Chaplin.
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:04.640]   Yeah, you might want to bring it back Ian.
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:07.080]   You could be the guy that brought back the toothbrush.
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:11.600]   I'll try to remember the guy's name but I am tempted by the little, you know, the razor
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:12.600]   thin mustache.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:13.600]   Oh.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:14.600]   I was even...
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:15.600]   Yeah.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:17.440]   It wasn't Noel Coward.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:18.600]   Was it all...
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:21.280]   It's David Niven.
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:22.280]   David Niven.
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:23.280]   David Niven.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.280]   David Niven.
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:25.280]   David Niven.
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:27.280]   Right.
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:28.280]   The moon's a balloon.
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:29.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:30.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:31.280]   So I'm thinking about trying that out for a day or so but I'm just so keen to get rid of
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:32.280]   it.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:33.880]   As far as you go up the stash, you should try some different variants.
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:34.880]   Play with it.
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:35.880]   Yeah, play with it.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.160]   The amount of people who said, oh, good grief in.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.040]   You look at younger Ron Jeramey as just like...
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:45.280]   I could live without that kind of association.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:46.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:47.280]   Okay.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.280]   Thank you, Ian.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.120]   I appreciate it.
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:54.320]   Thank you also to Dwight Silverman who the next time we speak will be a Forbes columnist.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.040]   That's very exciting.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:58.560]   Right now though, he's at TechCrunch.
[02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.600]   HoustonCronicle.com/techburger.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:04.200]   Yeah, start with the TechCrunch really.
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:05.200]   Techburger.
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:12.040]   TechCrunch with Forbes on February 1st and still trying to map out exactly what it will look
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:15.320]   like but I'm really excited about it.
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:23.280]   I want to say that I really want to extend my appreciation to the Chronicle who kind of
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.640]   made me what I am today.
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:29.880]   They gave me the opportunity to do this and it was...
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:36.040]   Every journalist wants to make a difference and help people with what they do and they
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:39.000]   allowed me to do that and so I'm really grateful for them.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.880]   How long have you been there?
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:44.000]   I've been here since 1990 so it was...
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000]   Wow.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000]   2020 was my 30 years.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000]   Wow.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000]   That's incredible.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.960]   And I did not think that when I came here that I was...
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:57.760]   Journalism is typically you hop from one paper to another but I settled in and liked it and
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:05.000]   Houston actually became a really nice place to be and so I have stayed and I will still
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000]   be in Houston.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.160]   I'll be working for Forbes out of here.
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.720]   Great.
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:11.600]   Thank you also Father Robert Ballisare.
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:12.600]   We miss you.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:13.600]   Our digital Jesuit.
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:17.800]   He is in Rome but when in Rome...
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:18.800]   I don't know.
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:19.800]   Eat the pizza.
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:20.800]   It's not even true what we do in Rome anymore.
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:21.800]   What is it?
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:22.800]   Eat bad eggs.
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:23.800]   Eat bad eggs.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:24.800]   It looks amazing.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:25.800]   Yeah.
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:27.720]   Anything you want to plug or you can do a podcast?
[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:28.720]   Yes.
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:29.720]   I'm still on your Minecraft server.
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:31.480]   You still doing it?
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:32.480]   Yeah.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:36.800]   Actually we're expanding the Minecraft servers into other gaming servers.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:39.560]   We've already brought up Rust.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:43.360]   They're going to be doing a couple of Team Fortress 2 type stuff.
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:46.280]   It's basically they've been asking the players what do you want to see?
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:48.200]   That's what we've been rolling up.
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:53.000]   Here I've been doing actually the 10 days of Ubergy Christmas.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000]   I've just been giving away tech gear.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000]   I saw that.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000]   That's what kind of it sits.
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000]   I'm going to get back into the game.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.880]   But yeah, most of the work I do, I am now behind the camera instead of in front of it.
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:06.440]   And that suits me just fine.
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:07.440]   Nice.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:11.960]   Twitter handle is Padre SJ.

[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:24.120]   Maybe between now and then there'll be some tech news we can talk about.
