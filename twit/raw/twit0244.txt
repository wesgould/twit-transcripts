[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.700]   This is TWIT.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.340]   This week in tech, the show that covers all the tech news.
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.500]   Ladies and gentlemen, joining us in studio today, John C. Devorek.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.000]   Hello.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.420]   The tech hippie.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.100]   That's his new show.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.780]   I like that.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.500]   I mean, somebody's new show.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.980]   Some guy looks like your brother.
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.340]   It looks like your brother.
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.300]   I know you went to Berkeley.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.420]   And so he probably-- you know, he's kind of like that.
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.140]   Very typical of a Berkeley student back in the day.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.380]   And the night is it's all kids from China.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.220]   Also here in studio, and I'm really
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.140]   thrilled to welcome him to studio today,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.940]   because he is our newest TWIT.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.740]   Actually, he will be, because you don't start yet.
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.780]   Mr. Tom Merritt.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.900]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.580]   Hey, Tom.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.140]   We're trying to find a name for a title for Tom.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.140]   I like Viceroy.
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.140]   Viceroy.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.780]   I'm Chief Twitty's Viceroy.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.900]   No, you don't like it, John?
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.140]   I think you get that kind of something that's--
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.620]   it should be a literative, and it
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.780]   should have the word Tom in it.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.060]   Governor General.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.900]   Major Tom--
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.860]   Tom Twitt would be--
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.380]   Tom Twitt, because he's got it.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.540]   We could all be-- I could be Leo Twitt.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.260]   You could be John Twitt.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.100]   He could be Tom Twitt.
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.620]   He could just all have the last name, Twitt.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.500]   Be like Ken Norton.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.180]   Be like the Ramon.
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.900]   Ken, you're thinking of--
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.700]   The other guy.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.100]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.940]   Joe Foreman.
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.420]   Foreman, George Foreman.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.540]   Oh, right, with all this stuff.
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.100]   You get it, really.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.780]   So Tom, you told CNET, right?
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.180]   No, not yet.
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.900]   The fresh release goes up tomorrow.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.540]   I was so busy Friday.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.380]   No, I'm really thrilled that we could get you as part of the Twitt
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.900]   family.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.820]   What's he going to do here?
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.300]   Four hours of daily programming.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.740]   Yep.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.900]   Monday through Friday.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.540]   He's the next anchor, basically.
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.180]   Eventually, we want to go 24/7.
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.620]   You expect to move him--
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.100]   not that I'm not noticing he's sitting right here.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.780]   But do you expect to move him to New York?
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.820]   You going to do the New York thing?
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.060]   Yeah, but you don't want to go to New York.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.140]   You could, if you wanted to.
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.220]   I'll stay here for now.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.500]   Well, you should.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.900]   Eileen is lovely wife as a studio artist.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.260]   I've already consulted about the New York thing.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.300]   She would love to go to New York, but not yet.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.140]   Well, maybe.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.540]   Yeah, she's given the New York--
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.740]   New York Museum is in New York.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.700]   The New York thing--
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.220]   They got restaurants there.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.700]   They do.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.140]   London, however.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.220]   When we started London office, you're number one on the runway.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.900]   That's going to be the end.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.500]   So Tom, of course, everybody knows from Buzz out loud.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.660]   He's been on the show many times.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.340]   He does shows on the Twitt network already.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.140]   He's been doing East meets West here.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.900]   Your new one, current geek weekly.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.580]   Yeah, it's been great.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.100]   It's great.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.500]   I love that.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.220]   I'm having a lot of fun.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.340]   Let's go.
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.660]   We had Jonathan Colton on this week.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.500]   I saw that.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.060]   I walked in.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.700]   I said, wait a minute.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.460]   That's Joko.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.060]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.060]   Awesome.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.620]   And not as a musical guest, but as a geek guest.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.060]   I'm going to have to get you to really--
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.180]   Now that you're in Twitt, you've got to talk into the mic,
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.820]   not across it.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.820]   Mike keeps running around.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.860]   Mike gives it as a barrel.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.460]   Point it down.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.140]   Point it down at your--
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.660]   Here.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.220]   I'll help you.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.420]   That's what they were trying to do before.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.820]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.900]   Now you can't.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.940]   Now you see, now you have that rich, refolgent sound.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.820]   We don't want to see you.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.860]   We want to hear you.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.340]   That's true.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.780]   It's actually the heritage of Twitt as a audio network, which
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.460]   is really not true anymore, is it?
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.940]   So I guess we got to get smaller mics or something.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.260]   You can get a few to talk across, Mike.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.260]   You know, Bob Heil.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.820]   This mic is such a great sounding mic.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.860]   I just love the sound, though.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.420]   I don't mind.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.500]   It's such a great sound.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.300]   Bob Heil, the guy who makes these mics,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.380]   and it's really a great guy, made us a smaller one.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.140]   You said I can make a small one for you.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.580]   Colleen has it up in her studio.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.580]   The same mic.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.580]   I saw it with the same--
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.580]   --all the sci-farts.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.300]   The same diaphragm.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.420]   Hey, would you-- or Jammerby, would you run upstairs
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.740]   and get that Mikey Colleen's office?
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.420]   I can show everybody.
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.060]   And he also says, you don't need the Spider-mount.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.580]   So maybe we could make these smaller.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.420]   But I don't care.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.340]   It's part of the setting.
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.900]   It is kind of cool.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.060]   John's choosing a wine.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.380]   Well, I mean, you've got something to check out.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.980]   Dane Golden or some all-game?
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.940]   Grade.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.660]   Smelly, eh.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.140]   To ink, grade, what does that mean?
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.980]   That means nothing.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.180]   We should make clear that I'm still at CNET until May 14th.
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.740]   Well, that's forever.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.060]   And then after that, I'm off for a couple of weeks.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.220]   And then I start here full time, June 1st.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.740]   Right.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.620]   So June 1st, your first day.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.140]   But we'll see.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.340]   You won't expect me tomorrow to suddenly die.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.340]   And I think that one of the first things we're
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.020]   going to do is a daily news show.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.860]   Today in tech.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.380]   Oh, wait.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.700]   Unfortunate acronym.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.860]   I don't know about that.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.620]   I'll have to work on the name.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.980]   But we'll do a daily news show.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.460]   Some agenda.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.460]   Tech 9.
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.140]   A partial agenda.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.860]   Partial agenda.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.460]   Tech 9.5.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.260]   Tech 9.5.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.820]   No, and I'll help you with that.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.300]   But we'll also looking for a coast for you.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.780]   We did admit we tried to get Molly to join us as well.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.340]   But she didn't want to.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.380]   It's OK.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.260]   She got a good offer.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.100]   That's my little mic.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.860]   What do you think?
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.620]   That's the Bob Heil Mini.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.900]   Mike Alito.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.220]   Show the camera.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.900]   Who's got me?
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.220]   Migalito.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.060]   This is the same basic mic.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.540]   It's just much more compact.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.540]   And it's light.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.740]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.860]   Well, this is a good mic to sell.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.300]   I know.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.740]   Except I don't know how you'd mount it.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.980]   You mount it the same way.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.780]   You don't know what you said.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.380]   You don't need the spider mount.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.780]   You don't need the spider mount.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.300]   No, you wouldn't.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.220]   This is a glamorous little mic.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.740]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.500]   Don't you like that?
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   You're traveling, yeah.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.820]   Bob Heil is so incredible.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.900]   He was a rock and roll sound guy.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.500]   He did the quadriphonic sound for Quadrifenia for the who.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.900]   He invented for Peter Framden's wife, Penny,
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.860]   said, I want to buy Peter or something for Christmas.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.900]   And Bob invented the thing.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.820]   They go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.300]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.580]   You know what it is?
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.220]   I thought it's an elaborate thing.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.740]   It's a tube.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.340]   It goes into your mouth.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.580]   And the sound goes into your mouth.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.740]   And then you put it in front of a microphone,
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.780]   and it comes out of your mouth.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.780]   So the sound from the guitar is pumped into a hollow plastic
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.980]   tube.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.900]   Well, then you just blow it.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.700]   You can all hear your voice.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.700]   I'm just blowing the sound.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.540]   Oh, that's just cool.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.620]   It's not fancy.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.500]   But Bob said, I mean, Peter loved it.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.460]   He fell in love with it.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.740]   He used it.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.740]   Of course, made Framden comes alive, which is a huge hit.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.940]   He said, but nobody used it better than Joe Walsh.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.460]   Joe Walsh is a guy.
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.420]   Well, that's too bad.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.900]   Life's better.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.980]   Bob, in Fairview Heights, Illinois, near where I grew up.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.980]   You're home area.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.060]   St. Clair Square, the mall in Fairview Heights,
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.940]   where we always shopped.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.980]   There you go.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.580]   They didn't sell Heil Mike's then.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.780]   Bob then is a ham, and he bemoaned the lack
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.060]   after being a sound guy for years
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.540]   that there was no good ham microphones.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.540]   And these PR40s that we use were made as ham microphones.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.420]   Well, you see, they have big balls.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.460]   They're the big-- yeah.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.820]   That's what they call them.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.260]   QSL, QSL.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.100]   I never heard of a ham caring.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.260]   I don't know.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.260]   And there you go.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.180]   So that has nothing to do with tech.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.680]   No.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.540]   Well, it actually does.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.940]   It just does have something to do with tech,
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.420]   but it's pretty vague.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.260]   Obscure.
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.580]   Are you going to Europe, person?
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.580]   When are you going to Europe?
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.460]   Yeah, I'm going for the IFA Press event this weekend.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.020]   What's IFA?
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.540]   IFA.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.380]   IFA is the German CES.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:57.820]   Ooh, fine.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.220]   And they have it every September.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.260]   And they do a press event in the spring.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.940]   So Tom's going to eat on a panel.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.500]   He's going to be on blogs and podcasts.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.140]   IFA panel.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.900]   But if the app doesn't stop, maybe we go, well, Spain right
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.140]   now is below the ash cloud.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.700]   Because Spain--
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.500]   Barcelona is not.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.100]   Spain is south.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.780]   But through it is.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.460]   Barcelona get covered today.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.460]   Yeah, I was looking at a map.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:16.740]   All right.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.660]   Well, we're screwed then, because we're
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.900]   flying into Barcelona.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.860]   Oh, no, you can't get a Barcelona.
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.820]   Because I looked at a map on BBC, and it didn't cover Barcelona
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.020]   yet.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.660]   But maybe it'll dissipate by Wednesday.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.700]   If not, we'll just go to Hawaii.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.660]   That's what I do.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.540]   They are flying planes under the cloud,
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.140]   but they're not putting passengers in there.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.740]   Well, the airlines are losing so much money
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.180]   that they're testing out planes to prove that it's safe
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.060]   to carry passengers so that the European agencies will
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.980]   allow them to fly.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.300]   $200 million a day.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.380]   $200 million a day.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:49.980]   A day.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.020]   The equivalent of how many euros?
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.980]   It's like five euros.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.500]   Five, six euros.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.860]   But no one said the way around.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.300]   More euros.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.100]   No, you're right.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.660]   No, you're right.
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.300]   No, it's five euros.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.140]   I'm not a fool.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.740]   I'm not the fool you take me for.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.420]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.140]   Would it be a good time to invest in transatlantic ocean
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.940]   service?
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.900]   I'm thinking it might be.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.420]   No.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.220]   Depends on how long that cloud's going to be around.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.940]   We don't know.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.100]   Last time, this is the little volcano.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.380]   And the little one went.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.380]   The big one goes.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.060]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.260]   And the sister goes.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.580]   The only thing keeping the big one from blowing
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.900]   is the fact that there's a huge glacier sitting on top of it
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.180]   and a little one melts the glacier.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.420]   Then the big one goes.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.740]   And then it's like five times bigger than this thing.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.460]   Oh, dear.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.100]   That would then you're going to trust a problem.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.780]   Yeah, that's what's going to happen after I get to Spain.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.540]   You'll be stuck there.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.340]   You don't have a French kid here.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.540]   He's sitting with us once.
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.100]   We have a French kid staying with this exchange student.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.860]   And she was the last plane out of France.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.780]   And she's never going home.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.580]   She's moving in with us.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.860]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.420]   She's not supposed to go home next week.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.060]   I don't think so.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.860]   Not well.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.180]   How long is it going next week?
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.460]   They keep saying, oh, it's going to dissipate in another 48
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:55.860]   hours.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.780]   But it doesn't--
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.420]   48 hours.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.940]   It doesn't seem to stop.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.020]   It seems to get worse.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.060]   It seems to expand.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.460]   And more ash is coming out.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.020]   You know what the hashtag for the ash cloud is?
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.380]   No.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.260]   Hashtag.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.340]   Well, of course it is.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.460]   Well, what am I thinking?
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.300]   I knew that.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.780]   I knew that way.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.540]   I'm knowing that.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.420]   You knew it.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.340]   You know, the Royal Navy is getting in on it as well.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.500]   They're planning to go rescue British citizens
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.020]   stranded by having them go to the coast.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.620]   And the Royal Navy will come and pick some up.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.620]   It's like Dunkirk all over it.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.020]   It's reverse Dunkirk.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.740]   Well, not reverse.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.180]   It's Dunkirk.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:26.620]   It's exactly Dunkirk.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.580]   But it's not a war.
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.900]   Right.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.900]   Blueburg--
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.540]   Or--
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.020]   Bloomberg.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.700]   What?
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.820]   You said Bloomberg.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:41.620]   Bloomberg says that the loss from the ash to the airlines
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.700]   is 200 million a day.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.580]   But there's also a big loss to the tech industry.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.180]   Revenue losses could be-- reach a billion dollars.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.420]   Because you can't fly stuff in.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.980]   You're going to have to ship it.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.420]   Parachables are already suffering right now.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.380]   Because you can't bring in fruit and--
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.380]   And what a terrible time.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.660]   All this stuff is just for this to happen to the airlines.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.900]   Yeah, I mean, fruit is just flown in.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.660]   But the--
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.860]   But the kick is the whole thing.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.140]   There's a lot of food that is.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.260]   Is that the French train workers were on strike.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.620]   They're still on strike, right?
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.100]   I don't know.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.100]   Are they on strike?
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.380]   I read today somebody, you know, kind of a personal story
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.300]   about getting to France and the trains were on strike.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.700]   I told a friend of mine was stranded in Paris.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.060]   And we told her, well, just take the train to the Dunkirk
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.560]   ferry.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.260]   Take the ferry back to England.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.660]   She had to go back to England.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.060]   And then we said, they can't because the trains were on strike.
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.140]   So everyone's stuck.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.340]   And I saw a stuck in Paris.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.300]   That's terrible.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.860]   Yeah, that's not so bad.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.740]   The railway strikers were like, this is the best thing ever.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.300]   Look at all the leverage we have now.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.660]   Did you see the president of Norway running the country
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.940]   from JFK with an iPad?
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.540]   Why does it go to the embassy?
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.540]   To the embassy.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.100]   There's a consulate in New York with Norway.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.660]   I don't think he really is running Norway for an iPad.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.220]   But it's just a-- well, it's just a great--
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.380]   no, it's just a great story.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:58.900]   I don't know.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.300]   I mean, how often do you get in the headlines
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.220]   if you're running Norway?
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:01.740]   Right.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.420]   You've got to do what you can to get some press.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.220]   I didn't know anyone was running Norway.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.140]   Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, thousands of others
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.380]   stranded by the volcanic cloud hanging over Europe,
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.060]   governing Norway from his iPad.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.100]   There's an app for that.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.300]   That would be good.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:15.660]   I have it.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.860]   Actually, I am actually--
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.660]   I have an iPad app.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.420]   You've been governing from your iPad?
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.940]   It's called Godfinger.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.700]   I heard I'm in there.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.700]   You are?
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.460]   Is that not you?
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.780]   Yeah, yeah, it's me.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.780]   You're playing Godfinger right?
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.340]   You're playing one of your people after me, right?
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.180]   Well, you can do that in Godfinger.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:32.700]   Right.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.140]   But you have a Godfinger game, right?
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.300]   I mean, you're talking about--
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.980]   It's a little app, little gamey app called GameyApp.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.100]   Godfinger.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.980]   Here, I'll let you play.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.460]   This is a little gamey app.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.540]   I've got my little people.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.460]   I've got my people.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.940]   And I run them with my finger.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.140]   That's what I like.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.380]   Yeah, it's like a catamari, Domacy meets We Rule.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.700]   I don't even know what those things are.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.580]   I don't even see anything.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.260]   OK, see?
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:52.820]   Play.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.300]   OK, so here's my planet.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.020]   This is really good for the folks listening at home.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.620]   I'll describe what you're about to see.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.100]   Oh, boy.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.020]   Look at all that gold.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.060]   I got to harvest some gold.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.700]   So all my people that have been working without me,
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.700]   they need some rain, though.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.100]   So let me get a cloud over here.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.980]   What's the black cloud?
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.940]   That's a thundercloud.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.740]   Oh, that's the Iceland cloud.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.380]   That's called Candy Cloud.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.180]   So I'm raining on him so he can go back to work on his farm.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.180]   I like that you rain on people to make them work.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.500]   Yeah, well, we'll watch this.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   This is this black cloud.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.020]   That's lightning.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.340]   And this little barn needs lightning.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.860]   So I'm going to hold it.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.020]   And strike it with lightning.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.860]   And she goes, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.860]   All right, that's enough.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.780]   Look, I'm going to pick him up.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.140]   See, he's tired.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.700]   He's tired.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.980]   So I'm going to drag him over to the tavern.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.780]   Well, I mean, here's a well.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.220]   This is, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.460]   this is the prelude to the nervous breakdown.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.940]   Well, one of the things that iTunes doesn't publicly
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.420]   release is the DSM IV classification for most players.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.900]   And I think narcissists lead in this game.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.500]   You think it's narcissistic?
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.860]   It's just because I'm called a god.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.020]   It could be a god complex.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.580]   I don't know if those are a little different.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.100]   It could be.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.780]   Oh, look, I just leveled up to-- I'm level 20 now.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.260]   That's what keeps you going, right?
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.580]   You want to keep leveling.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.620]   There's a great article.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.740]   I'm going to read you this article,
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.460]   because it's talking about Farmville and really
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.300]   the pernicious nature of games like Farmville.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.100]   And you'll like this because it's for intellectuals.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.660]   Let me find this.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.500]   It's in our delicious--
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.580]   Are you talking to me or John?
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.580]   He's just talking to him.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.140]   He's talking to himself, actually.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.820]   No, I'm talking to the audience.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.860]   We have a brilliant--
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.860]   I will.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.380]   I will.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:26.900]   I will.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.020]   You will like this because you are so smart.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.900]   Cultivated play.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.140]   It's from media commons.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.780]   The secret to Farmville's success.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:44.660]   This is a speech, actually, that AJ Patrick Liskovitz
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.860]   gave it SUNY Buffalo and Hearst.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.020]   I don't know what that means.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.260]   On March 9th.
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.380]   He gave a speech at SUNY Buffalo and Hearst.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.900]   Amherst is different from Buffalo, I thought, anyway.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.400]   Oh.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.660]   Well, now I think it's one of those schools that
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.980]   has low campuses everywhere.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.300]   He says, why is it that we like Farmville?
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.380]   You're such an intellectual, John.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.380]   You probably heard of Roger Kalwa's book, Man, Play, and Games.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.060]   No, but you know what?
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.340]   I'm sure my son has read it because he
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.740]   read every book on games in the world.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.660]   This is an interesting book.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.300]   He says, play is an occasion of pure waste, waste of time,
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.980]   energy, ingenuity, skill, and often of money.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.260]   However, games are a source of joy, as well as
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.580]   a healthy means of escape from responsibility.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.580]   And routine, and he kind of codified what
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.740]   makes a game a good game.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.380]   Farmville is not a good game.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.180]   He says, games that offers a break from responsibility
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.260]   and routine are good games.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.220]   Farmville is defined by responsibility and routine.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.980]   Users advance to the game by harvesting crops
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.140]   at scheduled intervals.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.180]   If you plan a field of pumpkins at noon,
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.060]   you have to return at 8 o'clock or risk losing the crop.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.220]   Each pumpkin costs 30 coins, occupies one square of your farm.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.580]   So if you own a 14 by 14 farm, a field of pumpkins
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.100]   costs 6,000 coins to plant, you have
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.100]   to click on each square three times,
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.660]   wants to harvest the previous crop,
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.220]   wants to re-plow the square of land,
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.740]   wants to plant the new seeds.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.780]   That means 600 mouse clicks to farm in an obligation
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.220]   to return in a few hours to do it again.
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.500]   That doesn't sound like much fun.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.980]   Why would anyone do this?
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.260]   And they say the reason is social obligation.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.540]   The key that Zinga, companies making hundreds of millions
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.780]   of dollars a year on this, figured out is,
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.260]   Farmville is popular because it entangles users
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.100]   in a web of social obligations.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.540]   When users log into Facebook, they're
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.580]   reminded that their neighbors have sent them gifts,
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.020]   posted bonuses on their walls, and helped with each other's
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.460]   farms, in turn they're obligated to return the curdices.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.860]   We play Farmville because we are trying to be good to one
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.380]   and another, we are polite, cultivated people.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.780]   Being suckered.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.140]   Suckered, it's troubling.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.460]   And by social engineers.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.820]   I think that's exactly the point.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.340]   We are being social engineered into this.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.100]   Well, we talked on Thursday on Buzz out
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.940]   about the guy Jeffrey Miller, whose hypothesis is
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.580]   that the reason we haven't heard from aliens
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.500]   is that they're all playing games.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.940]   And he's serious.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.300]   Like he says, as the evolved mind
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.220]   pays attention to indirect cues of biological fitness,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.980]   the result is we don't seek reproductive success directly
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.340]   anymore.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.820]   We seek tasty foods that have tended to promote survival
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.180]   and lustous mates who have tended
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.500]   to produce bright healthy babies.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.020]   The modern result, fast food and pornography.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.180]   Once they turn inwards to chase their, quote,
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.140]   shiny pennies of pleasure, they lose the cosmic plot.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.500]   And so they just turn inward and play games
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.460]   and never bother trying to contact anybody.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.460]   That is hysterical.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.900]   They don't have steady at home.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.380]   That's the problem.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.780]   The show is officially over.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.380]   Why?
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.380]   No, nothing.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.620]   Why do you say that?
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.060]   You guys are talking about aliens now.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.780]   Have you seen Far?
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.780]   Did you see the Facebook on the south part?
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.940]   I've got more friends than Kyle.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.860]   I've got more friends than Kyle.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.980]   How the hell do you have more friends than me?
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.700]   Because people think I'm cool, dude.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.220]   How many friends do you have, Kenny?
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.180]   Who?
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:02.900]   What?
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.020]   How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.380]   Are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.060]   Stupid Facebook stuff.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.700]   Why are you guys in here wasting your time?
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.420]   We're supposed to be out playing video games.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.780]   Stan, you don't get how cool a Facebook has become.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.140]   You can message your friends, play Yazzi with your friends,
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.740]   even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.660]   Dude, who the hell wants to play Yazzi?
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.540]   Stan, we know it's hard to get started,
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.900]   but we have a little surprise for you.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.580]   Yeah, dude.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.820]   We made you your own Facebook page.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.180]   Surprise.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.700]   No, I told you guys I don't want to be on Facebook.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.100]   Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.620]   I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.140]   I don't want to get sucked into this.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:39.940]   All right, fine, dude.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.380]   You don't have to add any friends.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.060]   You can just be like Kip Jordy.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.620]   Who?
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.900]   Kip Jordy, the third grader.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.500]   He's got no Facebook friends.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.500]   And he's had a profile for more than six months.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.020]   Ah, Jesus.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.900]   All the estates are from me.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.860]   So sad.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.660]   Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.180]   You guys are retarded on playing Xbox.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.420]   There's really people out there without a Facebook friend
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.500]   in the world.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.100]   That's so wrong.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.780]   But that's what this guy's talking about, right?
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.460]   Is the social responsibility.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.580]   You've got to satisfy your friends.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.660]   So he ends up, Kyle ends up joining Facebook,
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.020]   getting sucked into Facebook and feeling so sorry
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:12.900]   for this third grader.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.580]   I had zero friends.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.860]   He becomes friends with Kip Jordy.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.180]   And Kip tells his parents I've made a friend.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.620]   They're so excited.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.420]   He says, I'm going to go visit my friend's farm.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.700]   He has a farm.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.300]   And he takes him to the movies.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.940]   I mean, it is-- I have to say, I'm not a big South Park fan
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.380]   because it's kind of--
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.420]   with a little lude.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.820]   But this is the best--
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.780]   It's very--
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.340]   When they focus on a social issue like this, they kill.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.740]   They nailed this one.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.860]   And the page we're looking at is actually the Kip Jordy fan
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.700]   page on Facebook.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.020]   Like at Allen Facebook.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.740]   Yeah, facebook.com/kipdorody.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.540]   Kip has 143,000 fans.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.380]   But the updates--
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.260]   He's not alone anymore.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.100]   --are all from the show.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.820]   And I have to admit, when I was watching the show,
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.620]   I immediately updated my Facebook status
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.820]   to Ada Porkchop for dinner and had nice applesauce, too,
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.740]   which is straight out of the show.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.500]   If you haven't seen it, it was not this week.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.900]   I think it was last week's South Park.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.740]   I'm the most--
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.900]   Available online everywhere.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.380]   You know, I've never played Farmville.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.300]   Not at once.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.100]   Well, you're playing We Rule, but it's just pretty much
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.620]   the same thing.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.120]   I know.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:19.700]   It's really similar.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.780]   But it seems like there's less social obligation.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.700]   You know, it was more fun.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.260]   And so you don't get that push to--
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.220]   Like, hey, so it's a left-year gift.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.220]   Let's just take a look at--
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.180]   Let's just take a look at the talk about computers.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.420]   These are all running on computers.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.340]   This is technology, John.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:32.660]   You know what?
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.900]   This is what's happening.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.860]   And I think this is actually relevant.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.140]   It is that when we started, John and I started,
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.140]   we would talk about processors, how much RAM,
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.060]   how to turn a telnet account into a slip account
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.260]   so you could use Mosaic to surf the net.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.940]   And what's happened is it's no longer important.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.420]   What's important is what you do with it.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.780]   We don't care about what process.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.460]   Nobody cares anymore, right?
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.660]   What I said.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.820]   It's become about content.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.140]   Well, the iPad is the emblem of that.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:01.980]   It is all about content.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.700]   Because all of the criticisms of it
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.820]   are that it is not open and it can't do all
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.260]   of those things that you want to do to modify it.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.220]   And I think David Pogue pretty much
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.780]   had nailed it when he said, look,
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.820]   there's two groups.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.460]   There's the group that's going to hate this,
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.860]   because they're geeks and they can't open it up
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:16.860]   and do what they want with it.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.300]   And there's the other group that aren't geeks
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.180]   and they don't care.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.420]   And it's a toy for them.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.780]   And they can do what.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.220]   Hey, Tom, by the way, I meant to say about your We Rule farm,
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.220]   you really got to work on it.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.260]   It's kind of getting a little disordered and disheveled.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.380]   You mean the organization of it?
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.500]   Yeah, it's kind of that.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.500]   It's not as nice as it could.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.300]   You need to put in a little small body, small water.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.460]   A little more work on that.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.540]   I just mean, do you guys keep talking on?
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.660]   I'll start working right now.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.500]   Let's take a break.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.300]   There is tech news, believe it or not.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.660]   By the way, I just got a out of memory on my iPad,
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.700]   which I've never seen.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.620]   You get that on the We Rule.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.620]   It's a We Rule bug.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.460]   It's a We Rule bug.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.300]   OK, so it's not the iPad.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.700]   No, I don't think so.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.500]   You dodged a bullet, my friend.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.820]   John, you haven't touched it, right?
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.700]   This is your new to the iPad, right?
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.700]   I've touched hers.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.620]   That's just your first iPad.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.620]   Thank you for clarifying.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.620]   You touched Eileen's first time, right?
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.380]   What do you think?
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.540]   It's fine.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.060]   It's a giant iPod touch.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:09.900]   It is, but that--
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.580]   Although I'm going to-- I have the nano version of this,
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.340]   which is indeed--
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.900]   Yeah, iPod touch.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.100]   Pad nano.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.020]   I have not used my laptop in a long time,
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.500]   and it's interesting, because Apple just this week
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.620]   announced new laptops, which normally I would have jumped to buy.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.420]   That's you.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.300]   And I didn't.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.860]   Because it's like, I haven't used my laptop.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.660]   I can't really justify it.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.380]   They also didn't do a lot to--
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.260]   They didn't change the look of it.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.620]   They didn't-- they added the better graphics processor
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.700]   and the i5 and i7 processors, which are nice.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.900]   And it's good performance update, but they didn't
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.300]   change how it works.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.580]   Nevertheless, knowing me, I would have bought one.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.460]   Had I not, sounds that the iPad was enough.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.980]   I don't use a laptop anymore.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.900]   Well, you know, with me, I only use a laptop when I travel,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.980]   and I'm in a hotel.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.580]   Right.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.700]   Over here, when I borrow--
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.060]   So you use a desktop most of the time?
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.580]   I'm a desktop user.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.020]   I like a bunch of big screens.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.380]   I like to be in mission control.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.420]   I think that's what's going to happen,
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.380]   is that those people who use something for portability
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.700]   will go with something that's much more portable.
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.220]   I've got a lot of people that's true.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.420]   And then if you really need power--
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   A very good example.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.260]   Is that what he would do?
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.180]   He's crazy about this thing.
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.340]   I am too, I have to say.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.740]   Oh, there's Tom fixing his wee rule.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.020]   I just had to harvest some beans.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:18.820]   You know what?
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:19.300]   This is--
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.340]   To me, and I got ticks and flack from this,
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.580]   from some folks who work in medicine who are like,
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.420]   no, this is not a toy.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.500]   But for me, this is a toy.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:25.940]   It's a toy.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.540]   I read comics.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.540]   It's totally a toy.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.020]   I wanted to watch videos on it.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.380]   You know what?
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.300]   There will be people doing work in vertical markets
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.780]   like medicine, but it's a toy.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.460]   We're going to take a break, come back, talk more about the tech
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:42.180]   stories of the week John C. Devorak is here from channeldevorak.com.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.940]   He's got a new show we got to talk about.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.460]   Or his brother has a new show we got to talk about, The Tech
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.900]   Hippie.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.820]   Just a little bit.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.380]   Also our newest Twit.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.020]   Tom Merritt will be joining the Twit family on June 1st,
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.340]   doing new shows.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.580]   He's already doing quite a few shows on.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.780]   What's with Sword and Laser?
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.900]   Can we get Sword and Laser?
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.980]   Is that Revision 3?
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.540]   He's going to have that.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.180]   It's possible.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.180]   We'll have to figure that out.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.820]   I want that.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.420]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.020]   I love that show.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.500]   Anyway, it's great to have you aboard.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.100]   Thank you.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.300]   We're going to be back in just a second.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.860]   But I've got to tell you about a brand new product from an old
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.260]   friend.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.260]   Citrix is back with something called GoToTraining.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.780]   I know you know about Citrix's product.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.820]   They invented remote access.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.580]   They were really the guys who pioneered it.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.260]   Citrix is still widely used in enterprise.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.220]   Their GoToMyPC makes remote access.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.100]   Sibyl GoToMeeting makes meeting simple.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.180]   And now GoToTraining.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.340]   Improve learning, participation, and access to training programs
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.660]   and save a bunch with GoToTraining.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.740]   It's a web-based tool.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.860]   It enables up to 200 people to connect to a training session
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.820]   right from their desktops.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.340]   This is the latest in e-learning.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.540]   And it's real time.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.460]   Or on demand.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.980]   You can record a session and they can go and visit.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.780]   This is really mostly for companies or consultants who
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.900]   need to train employees or customers.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.580]   GoToTraining.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.780]   The Citrix folks said, I bet you.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.580]   Maybe not a lot of them are listening to it, but I bet you.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.060]   There's quite a few people who've been in really crappy,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.380]   corporate training.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.700]   Like I might say, can we please use GoToTraining?
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.940]   It really is a great way to bring training sessions online.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:21.140]   Easily, affordably, eliminate, travel, save money on materials.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.460]   You can upload any document type or link to any website
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.260]   to create your own content library.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.780]   So you have your own curriculum.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.420]   You can create and customize tests.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.100]   You can send out email invites.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.460]   There's scoring.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.060]   I mean, it's just really remarkable.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.140]   We played with it a little bit.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.180]   I was very, very impressed.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.940]   Screen sharing.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.260]   You could pass presenter control from one PC to another.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.540]   Built-in voiceover IP, by the way, as we did a GoTo meeting
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.740]   with the folks to learn about this, on my iPad.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.540]   It has the VoIP built-in the iPad.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.780]   I just went in there and this microphone on the iPad.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.340]   I'm talking.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.220]   I've got the whole meeting on here.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.260]   It's amazing what they're doing.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.860]   You could present the session yourself
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.500]   or include experts from anywhere in the world
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.420]   through screen sharing.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.700]   Get feedback from your attendees while you present.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.820]   There's an integrated chat window.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.540]   There's a polling feature I can go on and on.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.500]   Look, just try it free.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.980]   Or get your corporate trainer to try it free.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.020]   30 days, GoToTraining.com.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.220]   And if you've attended a training session in person recently
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.860]   and it's not been up to snuff, send a quick note to the trainer
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.820]   and say, you might want to try to go to training.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.740]   If you're an IT manager, mention GoToTraining
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.860]   at your next staff meeting.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.940]   GoToTraining.com.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.420]   Free for 30 days, we thank Citrix so much for their support
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.820]   of all of our shows and really want you to try GoToTraining.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.420]   I was very impressed.
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.740]   Brand new from Citrix.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:49.020]   Back to the show we go with John C. Dvorak and Tom Merritt.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.100]   So you think the Apple laptops are less than inspiring, Tom?
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.420]   Yeah, I think I'd be excited if I was definitely
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.020]   in the market to buy a new laptop.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.180]   No, I thought it was interesting.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.620]   It's a graphics card, good processor.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.940]   But they're not the thing that's going to make me say,
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.740]   oh, I'm looking at my laptop now and I've got to dump it.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.220]   It's true.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.140]   Because this is working fine.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.860]   It's actually true.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.100]   Although 10 hour battery life on a 13 inch--
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:10.820]   This is the new thing.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.460]   Wasn't a previous 13--
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.260]   Not 10.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.260]   I think--
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.460]   I was pretty close though.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.100]   Was it like a two and a half or anything?
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:18.940]   Was it really nine?
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.780]   I don't think people were really--
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.900]   My son has one of those in the last forever.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.420]   One thing about Apple that I found is that they don't want--
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.700]   They're a claimed battery life.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.140]   Usually that's one of the few things they don't lie about.
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.460]   Their claimed battery life usually
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.860]   ends up to be around the actual battery life instead of--
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.300]   I have to say I am extraordinarily tempted
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.740]   by a 10 hour or 13 inch.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.900]   And I think the iPad's changed my expectation.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.260]   Why don't you just keep the iPad and stop using it like that?
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:44.900]   OK, thank you.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.420]   Because the iPad battery life is crazy.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.740]   He's got an email from Apple.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:53.580]   I got the-- effectively the email is like an intervention
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.780]   from Apple.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.340]   Will you stop talking about us?
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.780]   No, no, no, no, not that too.
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.860]   But I don't think Apple cares about that.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.500]   Let's see.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.620]   Come on, tell us.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.940]   I'm going to read it to you.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.900]   Here it is.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.780]   Thank you for your recent Apple order
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.300]   to ensure that all customers are given equal opportunity
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.380]   to acquire this product.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.580]   We have limited the amount available per customer.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.900]   Therefore, this order has been canceled.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.420]   What?
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.860]   You got what canceled?
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.700]   I bought another iPad and they said I couldn't have it.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.620]   And then you can't.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.460]   But you could walk down to the store and buy--
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.220]   Oh, let me buy anymore.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.300]   You could have a-- you'd walk you
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.180]   and you wouldn't fall over.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.700]   You could have one on each hand.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.300]   I was trying to make an iPad fast.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.060]   So they bumped you?
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:34.460]   They--
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.460]   Yeah, they canceled my order.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.220]   But I mean, let's throw out the reason.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.100]   Yeah, that's the reason.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.860]   You don't need another one possibly.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.580]   But why do they care?
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.060]   Well, apparently there's a shortage.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.620]   I mean, if you drive down to Emery Villam by one,
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.220]   they're not going to deny it and they'll take money.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.340]   I think there's a limit of four per account,
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.340]   because I've ordered four.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.700]   Oh, this is unbelievable.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.060]   Well, maybe there's a real shortage.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.980]   You're going to bite on one while you're working on the other.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.140]   I mean, what do you need more than one?
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:28:59.900]   Look, I only need one.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.140]   I'm giving them to people.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.340]   Oh.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.460]   If there were that much of a shortage,
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.060]   you couldn't walk into a store and buy one, which I did on Friday.
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.460]   Did you?
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:05.460]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.620]   You were able to walk in.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.940]   All right, well, that's what I'll do.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.620]   I wanted a 3G.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.940]   Well, the 3Gs aren't in yet.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.460]   Right.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.460]   Well, that's what I ordered.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.820]   And they said, no, we canceled your order.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.820]   Can't have the 3G.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.340]   They canceled my order.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:16.860]   That's crazy.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.500]   They've also announced that the European deliveries are going
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.380]   to be much delayed.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.980]   And I think this is, again, shortages.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.140]   I think these things are selling better than Apple.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.020]   Well, let's put it this way.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.180]   Apple can't keep up.
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.260]   Well, that's the myth they want you to believe.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.780]   No, but you know, the same thing I remember with the Nintendo Wii.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.980]   And I had this argument many times with people.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.060]   No company wants to create artificial shortages.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.260]   There's no advantage to that.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.500]   If you've got people saying we want to buy it, they want to sell it.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.460]   Don't they, John?
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.580]   Isn't it to their advantage to sell it rather than to create
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.940]   this imperative?
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.420]   Nintendo is the last people who play with this.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.900]   Then they gave everybody a run for their money
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.380]   and they became a huge demand, a pent-up demand.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.140]   So you think they faked it?
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.580]   No, no, Nintendo.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:58.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.180]   Oh, please.
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.820]   You think they artificially limited Wii availability?
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.780]   Absolutely.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.540]   Really?
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.660]   I think I don't think Japanese can flip a switch
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.540]   and have 10 million products made overnight.
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.700]   I mean, it's not like, yeah, this had to be.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.460]   And there are people in marketing.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.700]   They have a marketing department with probably 50 people.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.140]   And they projected, know exactly how many they're going to sell.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.900]   So they created a scam.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.380]   It's not as well.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.700]   I only partially agree.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.700]   I think they were taken by surprise with how many people
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.540]   wanted to buy them.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.220]   But I think you're right that they sat on it.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:34.420]   Instead of turning up the production, they squeezed it a little bit.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.180]   It doesn't take much.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.540]   But don't you--
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.100]   I mean, more social engineering.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.540]   Like that crazy game you got.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.900]   When you prefer to sell everyone you could--
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.740]   Yeah, me.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.740]   But I'm not a social engineer.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.660]   I don't have the--
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.700]   So you'd think you'd sell more in the long run
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.300]   if you created this false impression that there's scarcity.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.700]   That's, I think, a theory.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.540]   And I think it works.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.380]   Because Nintendo just went crazy with it.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.980]   It can work if it's done properly.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.340]   You know why it probably works?
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.980]   Because the truth--
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.660]   Oh, and I'm going to get the email when I say this.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.740]   And I've said it before.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.860]   The truth is the Nintendo Wii isn't that compelling
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.860]   of a product.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.660]   You buy it, you play with it, and you have to--
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.660]   I mean, come on, it's on the shelf, right?
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.460]   It seems to be the common.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.060]   No, that's not true with kids.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.380]   But she's being used all the time.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.900]   It's actually in the same class as the iPad, which is--
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.900]   Well, that's when I'm wondering--
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.140]   --continued to play with it.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.220]   That's when I'm wondering.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.340]   But the folks who are used to an Xbox or a PS3,
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.500]   they get bored with it really quick.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.140]   Although I have to say the kids tend
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.020]   to use the DS more than they do the Wii.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.180]   I'm thinking they love that.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:28.660]   The DS?
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.180]   No, the DS is real is real.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.420]   And the new DS is nice.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.020]   And it's real.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.540]   Three DS.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.380]   But I think the other three DS.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.220]   I think the Wii--
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:36.980]   The Wii.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.780]   I think the Wii isn't that compelling.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.860]   And so maybe this--
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.540]   Now you get net flicks through the Wii.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:43.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.580]   I think maybe this--
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.580]   What is it?
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.220]   This theory that--
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.820]   By the way, the whole thing is a fiasco.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.180]   I got the press kit.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.580]   So they sent me the disc.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.700]   So I tried it out.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.860]   And now you can't-- nothing happens
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.660]   till April 14 or something like that.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.740]   So I wait and it gives me a code.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:02.580]   It says, go to netflix.com/we.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.020]   And there's no place to put the code.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:04.700]   It doesn't work.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.500]   The whole thing is somebody dropped the ball
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.860]   on the promotion.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.060]   I have it on the PS3.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:10.740]   It works fine.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.220]   You register.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.620]   It's just like the Roku except you
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.740]   have to leave the disc in PS3, which is so annoying.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.540]   You have to leave the disc in the Wii.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.460]   It gives you that experience of playing a DVD.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.580]   It's so stupid.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.500]   Darth Emma, Terry in our chatroom,
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.620]   says she was able to activate her Wii yesterday.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.020]   And it works fine, John.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.460]   Once again, John, admit it.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.780]   You have trouble with technology.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.860]   This was the specific program for the press.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.220]   It wasn't the normal Wii.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.820]   Yeah, you can go on there right now and type in that with Wii.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.020]   You can do a sign up and you can go through a rigamarole
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.380]   and it'll be working fine.
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.980]   But I'm saying the press kit, which
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.180]   had this special program, didn't work.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.260]   Didn't allow you to--
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.980]   And unless you went through that,
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:51.700]   I don't think the--
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.260]   Apparently, the Wii will turn you into a nympho.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.460]   Did you know that?
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.940]   This is a story from the register, a Manchester woman who
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.100]   took a tumble from her Wii Fit board.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:00.740]   Oh, I heard of this.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.500]   Is suffering an earth-moving side-effect
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.940]   of the Nintendo-related mishap?
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.140]   She is now a nymphomaniac.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.940]   Randy Amanda Flowers, age 24, was diagnosed
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.700]   with, quote, "persistent sexual arousal syndrome
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.820]   due to a damaged nerve."
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.980]   Not another nympho, either.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.420]   She has a faggish nerve.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.900]   She's susceptible to the slightest of--
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.660]   This is one of those great tech stories.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.780]   I'm sorry I started this.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.740]   You have to read it now.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.900]   She's susceptible.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.500]   I should do it in the Viennese accent.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.860]   She is susceptible to--
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.340]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.060]   The assus is a Viennese accent.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.340]   Dr. Freud says she is susceptible to the slightest
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.340]   of vibrations.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.620]   Thank you, you like that?
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:46.020]   With anything from mobile phones to a food processor,
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.580]   guaranteed to give her a buzz.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.700]   Dr. Ruth.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.860]   It says-- she says, "It began as a twinge down below before
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.860]   surging through my body.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.260]   Sometimes it built up into a trembling orgasm."
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.660]   Oh, please.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:08.780]   She's a catering worker who now requires 10 sessions a day.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.580]   10 men?
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.300]   10 men a day.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.540]   I would venture to say that this is not widely applicable.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.380]   I don't think most users of the Wii will--
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.380]   I like that to happen to me.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.740]   --will encounter this issue.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:19.580]   That's bizarre.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:19.940]   I don't know.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:20.860]   I'm sorry I brought that up.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.380]   Can we edit that out?
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.020]   No.
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.820]   So far, it's the best thing in the show.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.820]   Well, let's get to your column then.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.300]   John C. Devorek, what are you up?
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.300]   Is this market watch?
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.060]   What are you up to again?
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.100]   Not the market watch column.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.300]   What are you up to now, Devorek?
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   Did you read it?
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.300]   No, let me read it right now.
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.540]   Shall I read it in a Viennese accent?
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.540]   I think a German accent.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.540]   German accent?
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.540]   I think your accent is the same.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.180]   You know, Jeff Jarvis speaks German.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.180]   He does our This Week in Google show, which is moving
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.740]   to Wednesdays, by the way.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.740]   Wednesdays.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:51.740]   On the internet, everywhere.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.220]   The Twit Network.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:57.260]   The Twit Network.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.540]   He pointed out that the word for A-hole in German is
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.740]   "Arschlock."
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.580]   Arschlock?
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.420]   Arschlock.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.700]   So he's calling it the "ashlock."
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.700]   Get it?
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.700]   It's a little German pun.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.860]   You won't hear those very often on this show.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.860]   No.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.860]   For good reason.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.420]   So what is your marketplace-- I'm trying to find your
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.420]   market--
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.420]   Market watch.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.420]   Oh, that's why I type "muchek market place."
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.420]   Market watch.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.620]   Well, essentially, you say that net neutrality--
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.620]   Time to short apple.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.140]   No, no, I didn't say what you're going to say.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   How do you know what I said?
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.380]   Because you started off with the sentence structure that
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.940]   is going to lead you one direction.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.740]   I've got to read this one because I got it by X--
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.740]   Free speech.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.740]   Is that not right?
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.300]   This is writing June 7, 2007, when Apple computers-- oh,
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:35.980]   well, you might be right.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.940]   Was it 247?
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.580]   Time to short apple?
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:41.460]   No, that's an old one.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.660]   That's when it was shortable.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.580]   It was because it went down quite a bit.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.580]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.580]   But it's now back up.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.140]   Well, you don't stay on your short forever.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.220]   That was a good move.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.780]   It's in the Google Doc, if you want to link to it.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.460]   Net neutrality threatens free speech, says John C. Devorak.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.300]   That's your headline.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:55.820]   And you--
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.820]   Berkeley, California.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.820]   That was a sentence structure.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.400]   I love it that they-- that they
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.100]   date line at Berkeley, California.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.940]   Yeah, so everyone knows I'm nuts.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.420]   There's a proposal afoot developed by Senator John Kerry
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.780]   that could undermine free speech on the internet.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.260]   That's the voice we need, OK?
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.100]   It's a news--
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:13.100]   News--
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.100]   News--
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   News--
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100]   Winchle.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.620]   It's tricky, so let me explain.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.620]   If you have not been following the net neutrality debate,
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.820]   then you are missing out on the most contentious argument
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.460]   concerning online services out there.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.100]   Most recently, the courts ruled that the Federal Communications
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.980]   Commission has no real jurisdiction over the major.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.460]   This is the Comcast thing.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.820]   And the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.820]   ruled that--
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.340]   see, I had a big, long email exchange
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.700]   with a telecommunications expert.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.820]   He said, you know, you got it wrong last week.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.420]   It wasn't that the court said that the FCC couldn't do it.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.260]   They just did it wrong in that case.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.820]   So the FCC--
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.300]   this is, by the way, the DC Court of Appeals apparently
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.460]   is famous for being anti-regulatory.
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.340]   So it's not unusual for them to overturn government regulation.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.100]   So they said, not that you can't do it,
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.860]   but not just not in this case.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:11.340]   You say that this decision is meant to--
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:11.860]   No, no, no.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.640]   --take into mean a rebuke of the ill-defined
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.140]   concept of the trial.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.100]   That's what it's taken to mean.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.740]   And so then Kerry comes, you finish reading it.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.300]   You say not so.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.100]   This is such a quite good.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.940]   A group of online mavens believe that if allowed
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.780]   to complete freedom, the ISPs, like Comcast,
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.940]   Time Warner, and AT&T will manipulate the online experience
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.740]   by allowing sites and services they
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.580]   control to get better access and throughput
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.100]   than the competition, right?
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.180]   That's what it means.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.460]   Or they may ask Google for money, for access, which you
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.260]   say in the next paragraph, I'm just summarizing.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.420]   I'm paraphrasing because I can't read that voice very long.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.860]   It's only 600 words.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.060]   This is really-- what?
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.060]   Really, it's only 600 words?
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.560]   Yeah, it is.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.460]   It seems longer.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.460]   Thanks.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.260]   Makes 600 feel like 15 minutes.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:54.860]   That's great.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.980]   He feels like a couple of weeks.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.220]   This is really what that neutrality is all about.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.940]   You get that neutrality by making these hypothetical
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.060]   practices illegal.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.340]   The practices to limit--
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:05.840]   Right.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.180]   --they're high--
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:06.940]   And you make a good point.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:07.580]   --the tiered internet.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.060]   Which is, it's hypothetical because nobody's
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.820]   done it in the US yet, although they do it in Canada
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.740]   all the time.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.780]   AT&T said, we want to do it.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.220]   And we want to do it to Google.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:15.720]   Right.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.760]   That's still hypothetical.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.520]   But yeah.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.280]   The service providers all say they would never do this.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.740]   And net neutrality them means they cannot do tiered pricing
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.760]   schemes if there are restrictions developed
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.520]   to promote net neutrality.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.080]   So it would eliminate something they do want to do,
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:29.760]   which is tiered.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.440]   Well, they'd kind of do that anyway.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.000]   They do it anyway.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.440]   So here comes a great idea from John Kerry.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.640]   The idea which bloggers and various activist groups
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.280]   are all heated and promotional about will, if implemented,
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.920]   destroy-- this is good, John.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.200]   I like it when you say this.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.360]   Destroy the internet as we know it.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.440]   Kerry wrote an op-ed in the Daily Coast this weekend,
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.800]   which was then picked up by the post, the Huff Po,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.400]   and then by bloggers.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.040]   Net neutrality needs your help today.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.200]   He says, we need to reclassify broadband as a--
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.880]   I agree with this.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.960]   I agree with this.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   Mistake, if you read the--
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.280]   All right.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:06.760]   Well, OK.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.240]   So he says he wants to basically classify
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.000]   as its infrastructure, telecommunications, services,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.600]   rather than information services.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.200]   Its infrastructure, its like utility--
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:17.760]   If you read my--
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.320]   Not a publisher, not--
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.080]   In other words, return it to what
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.480]   it used to be classified as--
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:22.680]   Right.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.160]   --before Michael Powell opened it up and at the request
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.120]   of the industry said, OK, you're an information service.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.040]   And I go on.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:30.880]   All right, we go on.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.240]   All right.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.640]   This was supposedly give the FCC supreme power rather
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.200]   than vague power of the internet.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.120]   OK, so far I agree.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.520]   This is the worst possible outcome as the FCC
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.240]   will eventually regulate the internet like it does
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.800]   all the other entities under its jurisdiction.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.280]   By the way, a lot of controversy in even on--
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.440]   I remember John Perry Barlow saying even on the EFF board
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.240]   over, well, do you want government regulation
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   or do you want free market?
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.360]   Is there a free market?
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.760]   Do we really want the government to start telling us
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.120]   what to do with the internet?
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.520]   That's what you're saying, right?
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.840]   As we've recently witnessed with the FCC attacks
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.160]   on free speech in the various Howard Stern actions,
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.000]   that was an old FCC.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.280]   That was a different FCC.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.000]   But there is just make it goes back and forth and back,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.280]   but you can't trust them.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.160]   As well as the heavy fines for showing a nipple on the Super Bowl.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.520]   A nipple on the Super Bowl.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.480]   We can only imagine what will happen to free speech on the net.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.920]   I think I'm agreeing with you here.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   See, now I found it a little fatuous
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.400]   because television is not classified
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.800]   as a telecommunications service, so that it's not
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.120]   a fair comparison of an example.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.960]   And internet used to be classified as a telecommunications
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.120]   service and we didn't have any of these problems.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.760]   But what about John's point that we don't want government,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.840]   we don't weigh at the FCC to regulate the internet really.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.600]   Even if it's a telecommunications service.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.480]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.520]   I just don't agree with it necessarily for these reasons.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.520]   I think we want to regulate it as little as possible.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.520]   You don't think it's a power graph?
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.280]   I think what we need is more competition.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.640]   And what the telecommunications industry wants
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.040]   is whatever regulation benefits them most at the time.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.480]   So when being a telecommunications industry benefit them,
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.760]   they wanted to do that so they could collect
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.680]   the universal service fee and bring in that money.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.080]   And then they said, hey, you know what,
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.400]   that's not working for us anymore
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.600]   because we're starting to fall under these other jurisdictions.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.040]   So let's change it to an information service.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.600]   They got Michael Powell to do that.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.200]   But now they're looking at it and they're not saying--
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.040]   Mistake, that was a mistake.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.880]   We want that USF.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.720]   We want that service fee.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.280]   But we don't want to be reclassified as telecommunications.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.000]   So allow us to collect the fee, just change that part.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.840]   It's one of the money.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.680]   It's one of the most--
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.520]   It's one of the most--
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.040]   As telecommunications because then we'd have to open up
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.440]   our lines again to competition and we don't want to do that.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.160]   We had this argument last week on Twitter.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.740]   It was a really good argument between Brian
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.760]   Rushwood, who was a libertarian, and Baratunde Thurston,
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.200]   who was a socialist.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.680]   And it really is.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.080]   That's the fundamental question is who do you trust the market
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.040]   or do you trust the government?
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.080]   And I don't trust either.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.560]   So here's the problem that people have had with this column.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.680]   They assume that I'm against net neutrality.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.320]   I'm not against--
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.400]   In fact, this is government regulation.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.080]   Here's the point is that this whole thing that Kerry brings up
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.560]   and the discussion of net neutrality
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.880]   is totally besides the point.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:10.340]   Changing the definition of information to telecommunication
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.180]   has zero to do with net neutrality.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.380]   All it is is just it seems to me to be--
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.020]   And I point this out in the column--
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.100]   that I know for a fact that the Democrats and the FCC
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.180]   and all these people have been irked about talk radio
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.420]   and they moan about it incessantly.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.700]   And they don't like all these right wing nut cases that
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.100]   are all over the internet.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.020]   And they would love to get ahold of some regulations
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.900]   to shut people down and get rid of the porn.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.500]   I certainly hope that's not what's happening.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.380]   All that's happening in Australia as we speak.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.500]   It's happening all over the world.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.820]   Ireland is looking at doing it as well.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.500]   You got these awful act of three strikes laws getting
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:43.980]   in--
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.740]   Yeah, and that's what's the standard if we
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.460]   go in this direction.
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.780]   But, John, what's your answer to--
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.020]   But we really don't have a free market in terms
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:53.980]   of telecommunications.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.420]   I think that--
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.140]   I know competition.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.380]   I think we're far enough down the line
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.620]   if Sprint's Y-Mac starts to blossom here.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.940]   And then you get some really--
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.980]   Foster competition is the answer.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.940]   Obviously, that's always the answer.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:06.580]   Very good.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.260]   Foster competition.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.060]   And the way they've fostered competition in Europe--
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.620]   and I'm not sure what I think about this--
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.820]   is to say, you folks who make the pipes
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.420]   have to open it up to other ISPs.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.460]   And so there's competition on the lines.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.620]   It's funny because the FCC did that with telcos
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.060]   and didn't do that with cable.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.900]   Right.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.780]   And I agree.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.860]   That's what you needed to do.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.860]   And now they've taken telcos out of it.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.580]   And telcos don't have to open their lines.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.220]   And a lot of ISPs are going out of business.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.860]   I'm not in complete agreement with this.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.740]   That's why I like to see some wireless stuff happen.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.300]   Because when the telcos were told to open up your lines
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.580]   and we had people like North Point Communications, which
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.460]   I was working with to have high speed back in the '90s,
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.380]   there would be nothing but horror stories
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.140]   about guys going into the local switch.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.580]   And whoops, I tripped over your server.
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.580]   That's coming to the telcos.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.420]   I had Sonic net.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.300]   No, that's not coming to the other guys.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.180]   I'll contain Jasper back in here again, who runs Sonic net,
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.900]   who is a former chairman of the California Independent
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.740]   Internet Service Providers Association.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.060]   They're being squeezed.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.660]   They really are because the telcos
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.700]   want to keep them out of their CEOs.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.500]   Yes, they do.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.460]   And they want to monopoly.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.540]   I think you're right, though.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.340]   YMAX, which doesn't use copper.
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.700]   That Dane, by the way, is pushing sonic towards fiber.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.260]   Google is pushing towards fiber.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.100]   I mean, the problem is that these trenching solutions,
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.380]   whether it's copper or fiber, cost a heck of a lot of money.
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:27.500]   I used to think that wireless was our best way to go.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.460]   But the more I think about it, the more I realize,
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.020]   wireless always has its own problems.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.700]   And wired is always more reliable.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.220]   Right.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.380]   It just always ends up being that way.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.380]   Maybe that'll change with YMAX.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.260]   I would love to see wireless, especially YMAX,
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.340]   actually take off.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.860]   I mean, Intel's been doing nothing but dropping billions
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.540]   into it.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.060]   And the reason is because at some point--
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.060]   and you should say, wow, you're right.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.380]   Wow, you're right.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.940]   Because at some point, we will be streaming internet content
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.980]   into our cars as we're driving.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.540]   And you can listen to Twit while you're doing it.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.140]   We're doing it now.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.100]   If you have the iPad app, you can do it right now.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.300]   Same thing, that's a little more--
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.860]   But I don't think if they reclassify
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.100]   as telecommunication, it makes one Iota of difference.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.140]   It ain't going to be YMAX, by the way.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.700]   If you talk on the telephone right now,
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.380]   they don't stop you from saying dirty words.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.500]   They don't limit your free speech.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.940]   There's no fairness doctrine on--
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.460]   It's in--
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:12.980]   --unfreshed--
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:13.820]   --for conversations.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.100]   But that's not broadcast.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.300]   If you-- anything on the internet--
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.420]   But they're not saying reclassifies broadcast.
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.540]   And I know, but it has some point.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.100]   I guarantee it because if you think about the logic,
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.980]   the phone calls me talking to you.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.300]   But when you're on the internet, you're
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.660]   talking to potentially millions of people.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.380]   And it's not going to take much but one crazy court case.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.900]   And the next thing you know, wow, this
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   is a form of broadcasting.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.740]   And it is a form of broadcasting.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.060]   I think being classified as an information services,
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.700]   they are now as closer to that broadcasting,
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.820]   than classifying them as telecommunications.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.180]   Well, apparently the courts didn't agree with that.
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.300]   And that's why I think the FCC only has vague powers.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.540]   25 years from now, this is all be dissolved.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.940]   And this is what I'm going to look like, just so you know.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.340]   Where'd you get that?
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.900]   It's apparently an iPhone app.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:56.900]   Really?
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:57.620]   That's not bad.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.940]   That will age you.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.540]   I think I look like now.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.620]   But when you grow the mustache.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.100]   If I grew that mustache, I think that's
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.660]   exactly what I would look like.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.820]   What is the name of that app?
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.020]   It's called Age Me.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:11.660]   Age Me.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:12.540]   Free or paid.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.700]   Jason Cartwright is here.
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.340]   He does a podcast out of Australia called Tech AU,
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.740]   Tech AU.tv.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.340]   And he actually has a lot to say about this.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.460]   Should we bring him in and just talk a little bit about the
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.780]   three strikes issue in Australia?
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.780]   Let's do that in just a second.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.940]   We're going to get Jason miched up here.
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:33.940]   And while we're talking, let me mention Squarespace.com.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:38.180]   Squarespace is a great place to go for your next website.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.940]   The fast and easy way to publish a high quality website or blog.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.620]   We use it for our inside Twit blog.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:48.060]   And we're now working with them to redo the tech guy's site.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.980]   And a lot more because I just love it.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.980]   You've got to-- in fact, I know Tom, they support Buzz Outline,
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.460]   the great company.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.980]   Easy to use UI for managing and creating a website or a blog.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.460]   Optimized for both beginners and CSS experts, Jason can use
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.220]   my share my mic.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.420]   Just come around back here, Jason.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.980]   There's a blog module that includes import, support, and
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.220]   export to for WordPress, blogger, movable type, and
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.460]   type pad, so you're never stuck.
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.260]   Forms, photo galleries, form builders, Google Maps, and
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:19.700]   more.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.580]   I want you to try it free for a couple of weeks.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:24.220]   Just go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.300]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.940]   You just set up a-- don't even make it your site.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:28.580]   Just play with it.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.900]   Just get an idea of the great templating, the statistics,
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.820]   the iPhone app.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.420]   Incredible.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.780]   Can't wait till they do an iPad app.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.340]   That's going to be the ultimate blogging platform then.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.060]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.420]   And if you use the coupon code Twit and Tom, you were the
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.900]   one who explained this to me.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.540]   It's 10% off, not just for the first month or the second
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.180]   month, but for the life of your account.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:47.700]   Yeah, for good.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.580]   I didn't even know that all.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.380]   Just use the coupon code Twit.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.060]   I wish I had done that when I started my forecast blog.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.580]   Think of all the money you've saved.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.340]   Yeah, 10%.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.940]   Of course, at $8, $8 a month, which is the starting cost,
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.700]   I mean, that's $0.80, but multiply it times years, and
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.100]   it could be some dope.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:03.820]   Amortize that.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:04.820]   Amortize that.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.780]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.380]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.060]   tech.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.420]   Jason Cartwright does a podcast out of Australia.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.780]   Actually, it's really a network very much like Twit.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.100]   T-E-C-H-A-U dot TV.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.940]   And he's here on a kind of tech tour of the US.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:22.940]   Hey, Jason.
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.700]   Come sit over here and share this mic with me.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.140]   How are you?
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:25.620]   Hi, Leah.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:26.260]   Thanks.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.180]   So what's the status?
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.940]   I mean, I know it's gone back and forth in Australia, both
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.020]   the internet filtering provision and now the three
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:33.500]   strikes law.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.060]   What's the current status?
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.660]   Well, the internet filter is basically going to be
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.380]   presented to Parliament.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.820]   And it's all about the detail of what's in that.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.300]   So we've had a lot of room room speculation as to what's
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.180]   going to be included.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:51.900]   It's really down to their finer details as to what we can
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.460]   oppose and what the opposition can oppose and that sort of
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.060]   stuff.
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.380]   There's been, obviously, a lot of campaign and uproar against
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.620]   it to try.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:02.580]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, like public protests and things like that.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.100]   But they haven't really seemed to make much of a
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.300]   difference.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.060]   It's going to take this legislation to be in the courts
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.380]   and in the Parliament debate about it.
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:16.940]   And then hopefully, mass, a proposal of the filter will
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.300]   occur.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.860]   So at the moment, I think a lot of Australians just don't even
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.100]   know what's occurring.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:21.700]   Really?
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.260]   Because around the rest of the world, we're all very aware
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:24.420]   of this.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.140]   Yeah, people in the tech industry, obviously, who pay
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:28.340]   attention, they know about it.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.580]   And they feel very strongly about it.
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.420]   But people who just go about the day-to-day lives, they,
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.020]   it's just going to be imposed on them.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:39.700]   And so, yeah, we'd prefer that not to happen.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.460]   When it's really being railroaded, too, right?
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.220]   Because the ISPs did a test.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.780]   One of them refused, right?
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.260]   And then the other--
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.660]   Yes, you don't want to do it, the other day.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.380]   --failed.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.260]   And they still said, great, great test.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.020]   Everything failed.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:50.900]   Let's keep going.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.580]   So they'll try and basically, the tests involved specifying a
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.660]   list of websites that they provide a black list to.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.820]   And of course, if you provide that to a router or a switch,
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.820]   whatever, that's going to not let those through.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.260]   So they claim that it's 100% successful.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.460]   The issue is where you get into new sites popping up every
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.060]   single day.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.300]   And that sort of content needs to be basically used to do
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.620]   packet inspection to detect the content and block it.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.700]   And so obviously, we're conscious of the fact of over
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.740]   blocking and blocking material that's not unsavory, if
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:23.660]   you like.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.900]   And that's where the real problem is.
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.660]   What's the status of the actor, three strikes thing?
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.980]   The three strikes thing, I'm not 100% up to speed.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.780]   I've been on vacation for a couple of weeks.
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.980]   I don't know if it's currently an issue in Australia.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.180]   There was a New Zealand I know.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.580]   That's why we did that black.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.900]   I believe for a party, there's multiple countries involved
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:41.540]   in this.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:41.980]   Well, yeah.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.860]   Yeah, but there's not a lot of data that I'm aware of.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:49.740]   They put out the draft, finally, for public viewing after
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:50.580]   the New Zealand round.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:56.380]   The next round is in June in, I believe Switzerland, somewhere
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:56.820]   in Europe.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:57.700]   But it's all secret.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.380]   That's the sad thing.
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.380]   Well, it's not secret anymore.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.660]   They finally put out a draft.
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.300]   But what is still secret is the positions of the countries.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.700]   The US pretty much blocked anyone from admitting who's
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.220]   in support of what parts of it, because the US is the ones
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.420]   being pushed by the industry to put in provisions
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.220]   like a three strikes rule, which is not actually in act.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.900]   It's in a footnote.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.020]   There's a part of act that says, you
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:25.580]   should make every effort to deter copyright infringement.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.820]   And then in a footnote, it says, a great way to do this
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.580]   is a three strikes law.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.060]   So will there be an opportunity?
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:35.740]   Now the draft's out, is that now our opportunity to have a,
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.620]   I guess, a place that's able to debate it?
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.060]   Now officials can actually publicly comment on it, which
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.220]   they couldn't before, because it was all confidential.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.620]   It's really nice to meet you, Jason.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.300]   Jason's blog is techau.tv.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.860]   He's kind of doing a tech tour of the US.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.940]   And he picked up an iPad while he was in the states.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.540]   That was too big.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.580]   It was great that he was right there.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:55.860]   It just happens to be standing around.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.940]   I think we're going to use--
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.860]   Jason is one of our Australian correspondents,
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.140]   because he does a great podcast.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.420]   And it's great to-- yeah, which is very convenient
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.780]   that he happened to be around.
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:13.140]   Web 2600, apparently, is the author of "Age Me."
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:21.020]   So if you go to rfly.me/ageme, you can--
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.620]   oh, dear.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:24.700]   It's fun with the kids.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.540]   Make your relatives and friends look old.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.860]   Well, they say when you get old, you start
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.340]   looking like a baby again.
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.700]   Looks like Vicki Smothers there.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.020]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.300]   I like that.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:42.860]   Moving along to other stories in the tech world,
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:48.740]   the tech news world, Apple bans a Pulitzer Prize-winning
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:53.300]   satirist for satire.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.220]   Editorial cartoonist Mark Fiore won this year's Pulitzer
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:56.820]   Prize.
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:57.860]   It's a local boy, you know.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.460]   Welcome boy.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.060]   San Francisco Chronicle, right?
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:00.540]   SF Gate.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.900]   SF Gate, I guess.
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.340]   He has his own syndication business.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:09.620]   And he applied to Apple for an app called New Tunes.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.900]   It features his work.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:15.660]   Apple rejected the app because it contains content that,
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.460]   quote, "ridicules public figures."
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.940]   That's what he does for a living.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:21.580]   Yeah, you mean like--
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.500]   which is protected speech.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.140]   You mean like an editorial cartoon?
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.140]   You mean that's what you mean?
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.740]   You mean you can't go after public figures.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.500]   That's the way--
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.940]   You know, after private figures too.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:35.700]   Thank you, Justice Wrenquist for the protection
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.580]   of editorial cartoons.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.300]   But now, Apple has flip-flopped on this.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.460]   Apple has, as soon as this hit the press,
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.140]   it was denied back in January.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.660]   And as soon as the stories came out this week,
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.540]   Apple said, oh, no, no, we made a mistake.
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.900]   You're an app can go.
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:48.940]   Oh, interesting.
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.980]   Yeah, well, that was obviously going to happen
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.060]   because it was embarrassing.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.660]   Call from Steve Jobs on line two.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.460]   Mr. Fiore, could you please--
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:58.460]   What are you doing?
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.620]   This is bad, terrible press.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.980]   Credit to Wired's epicenter blog for publishing it
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:05.260]   and for getting Apple to back down.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.860]   But I mean, is that the way you want to have a store run?
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.500]   No.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.900]   The platform you want to develop for,
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.500]   where if you get enough press, you'll get accepted.
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.500]   But otherwise, you can be kicked out
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.700]   for just irritating the approvers.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.460]   You know, amazing that Opera Mini got approved by Apple.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.580]   The Opera browser got approved.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:22.620]   Yeah, that is kind of odd.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.100]   I did not expect anybody got a theory
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.740]   as to how that happened.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.540]   Well, you know, in the past, they've turned down anything
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.900]   that, quote, duplicated functionality inside the iPhone
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.500]   and the Opera Mini clearly duplicates
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.740]   the Safari browser.
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:35.060]   I think this is an EU thing.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.740]   I think Apple--
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.140]   Opera's been very active in the EU.
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.700]   They're the ones that got the EU to--
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:41.820]   Now, you're all over it.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.500]   You got the idea.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.620]   The Microsoft had to have a browser ballot giving Opera
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:47.820]   a huge market share.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.980]   It's worked again.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.900]   They're the number one free download in all 22 app stores
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.540]   worldwide.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:53.020]   What to add?
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:53.580]   Opera Mini.
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.100]   Really?
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.420]   Opera says that Apple contacted them
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.380]   and asked them to submit the Opera Mini browser
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:54:59.940]   to the App Store.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.740]   It has to be totally EU-related.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.820]   I don't know if I believe that because there was a countdown
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:07.300]   on the Opera site, like how long before Apple accepts us.
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.140]   I wonder.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:12.700]   And Opera's explanation is that it doesn't duplicate
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.020]   the functionality of Safari because it sends the request
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.900]   to Opera where it goes through a proxy
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.460]   and that compresses the pages and supposedly gives you
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.380]   a faster browsing experience.
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:22.980]   So that's different.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.620]   That's how they get off.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.620]   Which gives you a slower browsing experience.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.820]   And by the way, I should mention this,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.700]   a much less secure browser experience on Opera
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.060]   because they break all SSL certificates.
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.620]   And if you go to your bank through Opera,
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.740]   Mini, Opera can see everything that you're doing
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.860]   and you're banking because they have to do a man in the middle.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.460]   So--
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.660]   They don't do anything with it.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:39.940]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.980]   Do not use Opera Mini for anything secure.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.980]   They won't do anything with it, but maybe the CIA will.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:45.660]   Maybe.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.700]   These are Norwegians.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.500]   You know, they can run the country via iPad now?
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.660]   Apparently from an airport.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:52.780]   So it's not that complicated, apparently, to run a country.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:56.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:57.540]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.780]   When we come back, John, you may want to just
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.740]   have another glass of wine because it's all Twitter.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.260]   The Twitter Chirp Conference was this week.
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.260]   And some big announcements.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.300]   I have some thoughts on Twitter.
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:08.820]   Really?
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.740]   I'll find that in the Tech Hippy.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.060]   I believe you mentioned somebody.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:12.980]   No, I-- the Tech--
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.060]   One of them.
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.660]   I guess I have a new thought.
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.860]   It was a very brief thought, which we'll refer to.
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:18.340]   Can we just brother.
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:21.060]   His brother in the Tech Hippy had a brief thought.
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.300]   But before we do that, I do want to mention audible.com,
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.820]   audible.com/twit2.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:29.820]   Great place to go to get two, not one, but two,
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.900]   free books from Audible.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.020]   Audible's that great bookstore that we love so much
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:39.540]   of audiobooks, 70,000 titles.
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:43.180]   I know, Tom, you're a big Audible listener.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.340]   It's my favorite way to consume John and Hodgman books.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.700]   Yeah, because John reads them.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.700]   Yeah, and he puts in extra stuff.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:53.740]   So that's cool.
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:54.740]   What should we pick?
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:55.620]   There's so many choices.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:56.580]   I'm just finishing, by the way.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.260]   I really want to thank you for the Daniel Suarez
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.180]   recommendations.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:56:59.700]   Aren't they great?
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.820]   Just coming to the end of freedom.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.340]   So good.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.020]   Political.
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:04.980]   That's what I liked about him.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:08.020]   It seems like at first it's just murder, mystery, sci-fi.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:11.060]   And actually, it's really about open internet,
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.860]   and freedom, and corporate control, and all that stuff.
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.660]   John, you'd probably have a heart attack if you read it.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.660]   Definitely.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.860]   Mm-hmm.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.500]   They are doing a great job with sci-fi.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.900]   Maybe we'll point this out.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.940]   The Audible frontiers.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:33.180]   Audible is basically bringing sci-fi to your iPod,
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.060]   or your iPhone, or your Zoom, or your iPad.
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:38.540]   Because for many years, I think the sci-fi publishers--
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.460]   these guys were tabloid, pulp publishers.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.940]   They didn't have the wherewithal to record audiobooks.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.620]   So a lot of the greatest audiobooks
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.980]   were never recorded.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.860]   Greatest of sci-fi books were never recorded in audio.
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.780]   Now Audible has, thanks to their own initiative,
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:58.220]   3,000 plus sci-fi titles.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.620]   When I joined Audible many moons ago, like eight years ago,
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.220]   they had one or two.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.780]   So they've really improved it.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.140]   It's good for certain laser, actually.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.300]   Because the wind-up girl by Paolo Bocce-Galupia--
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.300]   Is that what we were reading right now?
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:10.820]   Current one.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.620]   And it is available on Audible.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.420]   I find-- I think one of the reasons I like that
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.420]   was certain lasers, because I like the idea
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.700]   of participating in a book group.
[00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.740]   But I just don't have time to read.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.340]   I'm always so tired when I get in bed.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:23.940]   I fell asleep.
[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.020]   I wonder why.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.900]   Because I have to hold this heavy iPad up.
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.420]   Yeah, it's hard to read on it.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.460]   Actually, I put it on a pillow.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:29.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.860]   I read on it all the time.
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:32.220]   I stick it on my knees.
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.020]   See, I can just put the audio book on there,
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:36.140]   and I can listen, which I like.
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:38.820]   You know what I want to recommend is Terry Pratchett.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:42.100]   I think almost all the disc world books are on Audible.com.
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.060]   Certainly a huge selection of them.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:47.260]   And it's really-- Steven Briggs does some of them,
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.060]   most of them, I think.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:48.860]   There are a few others.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:51.140]   But they just come alive.
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:55.820]   If you've not read any Terry Pratchett novels,
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.940]   you must have done some of the disc world stuff first.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:58.380]   Not yet.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:58:59.220]   Not for certain laser.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:58:59.700]   We haven't.
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:00.540]   You've got to do the--
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.460]   I guess you have to start at the beginning.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.580]   What's the problem series are always an issue
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:06.500]   when you're doing a book club.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.500]   And is this a series?
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.860]   There's like 50 of them.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:10.700]   Well, it's not exactly a series.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:11.500]   It's a world, I guess.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:11.980]   It's a world.
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.180]   That's how you look at it.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.500]   I can't remember what the first one was.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.540]   I know they have it.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:21.420]   It's where you first meet Rincewind, the magician.
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:22.500]   I just love this.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:23.140]   Love this disc.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.980]   Terry Pratchett is really different.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:30.580]   If you've never read him, it's the kind of sci-fi
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.260]   that you're not going to expect.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.620]   It's a little bit-- you think it's
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:34.900]   going to be more like Douglas Adams,
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.700]   but then it takes a turn where it's a lot more serious
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.380]   than Douglas Adams, but it's still funny.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.380]   Serious, but yes.
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.180]   And it's the kind of same kind of rye humor.
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:44.540]   This is the first one.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.580]   It's the color of magic.
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.940]   Discworld number one.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.460]   Great way.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.180]   Nigel Planner-- I'll play a little bit of this
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:50.740]   so you can hear it.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.140]   But Nigel Planner does a great job in writing this one.
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:55.420]   Yes, on the far bank, we're bravely
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.660]   responding to the situation by feverishly
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.740]   demolishing the bridges.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:02.300]   But already the ships in the Moorport docks,
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.020]   laden with grain, cotton, and timber--
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.060]   I can't read these now.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.460]   I have to listen to them.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.260]   Because I've listened to so many now.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.500]   I don't even want to read the words.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.260]   And they're alive in your head.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.140]   And that's one of the things that's great about audio books.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.780]   Now, that clip is low quality, but they do have this available
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.180]   in two, three, or four audio formats.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.980]   So you can get the much higher quality version.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.500]   And it's just the first of 50 of them.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.860]   Then there's a light fantastic and equal rights.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:28.740]   Get the first two.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.340]   Color of magic and light fantastic.
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.300]   Terry Pratchett-- Sir Terry Pratchett--
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.620]   great world he's created.
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.060]   And I think you will love these books.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.140]   They just come alive.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:41.100]   Audible.com/TwitToe-- sign up for the Platinum account.
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:41.940]   It's two books a month.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:42.860]   Your first two books are free.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.860]   And yours to keep.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.020]   You can cancel at any time.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.780]   And you still have those books.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:51.260]   Audible.com/TwitToe-- we thank them so much for their support.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.260]   And as long as we're talking, what
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.860]   was the name of the book that you're doing in the windup girl
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.060]   by Paulo Bache Galupian?
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:58.500]   What's interesting about it on Audible
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:04.340]   is that it is narrated by a narrator and the author together.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.900]   I think Veronica mentioned this last week
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:06.460]   when she was on the show.
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:06.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.220]   I think she did.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.540]   So there's another good choice.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.500]   Sortandlaser.com, if you want to join that book club
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.100]   in the good way.
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.100]   I mean, I love it.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.140]   Do you actively say, let's find books that are unaudible?
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.980]   We try to find-- we try to pick books
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.140]   for a lot of different reasons.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.900]   We try to find them in ways that are
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.900]   available in as many different formats as possible.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.860]   And they tend to be available in on Audible more often
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.380]   than on a Kindle, actually.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.180]   So it's easier.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.060]   Right.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:32.500]   I love it.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.940]   Audible.com/TwitToe-- we thank you for their support.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.380]   So Twitter had its first conference.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.660]   There have been a lot of Twitter conferences.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.500]   But Twitter's chirp conference was the first thrown by Twitter.
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.220]   And I've talked-- you know, Gina Trapani was there from our Twig
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.420]   show, and I've talked to other people there.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.380]   Gina kind of said, it's kind of funny to see Evan Biz acting
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.820]   like the startup boys.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.020]   Oh, J.A.G. Shucks.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.580]   We just have this little startup called Twitter.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.860]   And you know, we're just the kind of the young guy.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:02.820]   And she said, dudes, face up to it.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.780]   You're getting 50 million posts a day.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.460]   You're getting huge traffic.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.100]   And it's a very important service.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.940]   And stop pretending the aw shucks hippies.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:16.580]   They have announced, finally, a plan to monetize.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.540]   They go make some money by putting ads on Twitter.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.460]   Yeah, within the interstitial--
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.460]   Search.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.100]   Oh, no, search.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:23.580]   Search.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:23.580]   Search.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.420]   Starting with search.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.740]   And then eventually kind of very cautiously putting it
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.500]   into your stream interstitial.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.020]   They call it promoted tweets.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.940]   And if you're on Twitter, you can try it.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.940]   I think this is about as benign as you can get.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.500]   Try it by doing a search for Starbucks, for instance,
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:39.980]   on Twitter.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.100]   Is that working now?
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.820]   And there you go, right at the top,
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.540]   under real time results for Starbucks.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.500]   You know, when I first heard about this, I did it.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.540]   And they didn't have the promoted tweet.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.780]   And so the first, like, three tweets where Starbucks sucks.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.820]   I hate Starbucks.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.980]   So this is a way for a company to kind of control
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.100]   the message a little bit better.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.820]   But you know what's interesting?
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.740]   They said, these are real tweets, right?
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:07.140]   So you can see it says promoted by Starbucks coffee.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.420]   But it was a tweet from April 9.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.380]   It was a tweet from nine days ago.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.460]   It's not the most recent Starbucks tweet.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.220]   And it's a very clear ad, right?
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.140]   Yeah, it's got a different coloring behind it.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.820]   And it says promoted by Starbucks.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.220]   Well, only when I hover--
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.340]   Look at that.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.020]   Only when I hover.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.380]   The different color only happens when you hover.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.180]   But you can kind of tell.
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.900]   It's very much like Google where they have kind of a search
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.780]   result of the top.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.020]   Now, they say they are going to insert these into the tweet
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:34.580]   stream.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.220]   And that I'm a little more nervous about.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.820]   Well, they're nervous about it, too, because they're not
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:38.580]   doing it right away.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.820]   And they say they want to make sure they do it in a way that
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.980]   takes into account the kind of stuff you like so that when
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:46.340]   you see it, it sort of blends in the way a retweet does.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.620]   It's like, OK, that's the kind of stuff I'd be interested in.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:49.060]   But that's--
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.420]   Will it be by Starbucks?
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.220]   If I don't follow Starbucks, will it show up in my timeline?
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.740]   If you're the kind of person who tweets about coffee a lot
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.100]   or something--
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.060]   Yeah, it could.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.500]   --follow Starbucks.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.580]   That's a good question.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.340]   I know there are people out there who do.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.180]   I can't imagine anybody ever following-- wait a minute.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.700]   I guess I'm following Starbucks.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:07.140]   Are you?
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:07.620]   Are you really?
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:09.620]   Look at that.
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.780]   You're following.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.860]   Why would you do that?
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.580]   That's a really good question.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.220]   I don't know why I'm following Starbucks.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.420]   And that's why they need promoted tweets, because nobody's
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.140]   following them.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:20.660]   Nobody's following them.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.100]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:21.540]   Let me see.
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.060]   Let me see.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:25.100]   Hey, 845,000 people are following Starbucks.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.060]   I said no one.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.100]   Are you sure that they just made you follow them?
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.620]   Maybe they just follow them automatically.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.380]   Maybe the next thing you know, boom, you're following them
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.780]   and you don't know it.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.740]   That would be bad.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.180]   And if Twitter did that, they would get a lot of--
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.100]   But they didn't-- how are they going to get caught?
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:39.900]   First they'd take a look.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.580]   They'd say, how many people you're following,
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.100]   if it's over 5,000 or 1,000 or something like that,
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.340]   they'd say, well, who's going to know?
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:45.860]   Who will now?
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.340]   I'll never know.
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:46.860]   You just throw it in.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.460]   He'll just never remember.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.260]   Can't remember that many.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.220]   And why is Starbucks following 82,000?
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.540]   And how do they pick?
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.420]   And how do they pick?
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.060]   Yeah, they could be following 20 million.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.020]   I mean, that's how many people you--
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.860]   That sounds like they used to follow everybody who
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.060]   followed them and then they turned off.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.060]   And then they turned off.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.300]   No, but there's no way that 845,000 people actually
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.860]   are following Starbucks.
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:08.860]   Sure there is.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:09.340]   Why not?
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.020]   Oh, why?
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.540]   Why would you follow them?
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.500]   This is the stupidest thing you've heard humanity do.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.060]   You've heard of Farmville, right?
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:18.900]   Yeah, I don't know how many--
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.380]   I'll tell you why.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.020]   I'll tell you why.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.740]   They put coupons up there, of course.
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.700]   I know people who are big Starbucks fans,
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.180]   who they live and die by Starbucks,
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.620]   they can't wait to find another Starbucks.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.220]   When they see a Starbucks, they get excited.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.940]   They don't pretend to understand it,
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.820]   but I know they exist.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:33.420]   So I mean, the number seems pretty big to me.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.220]   Look, they actually ask you to follow them.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:36.980]   Here's one.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.140]   Hey Bernard, Fock, can you follow us?
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:39.820]   I have a question.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.060]   I'd like to DM you.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.140]   That's from Starbucks.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.980]   I think that April 15th, they gave away free coffee.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.500]   So if you'd followed them, you knew that.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.900]   You want to know about specials?
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.620]   Yeah, all right.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.940]   The next day, they gave away two free cups.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:52.740]   Really?
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.980]   Yeah, when it wasn't a special.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.220]   First prize is a cup of coffee.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.460]   Second prize is two cups.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:57.020]   I get it.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.020]   I get it.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.620]   And if you bring in a reusable mug on April 15th.
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.820]   Okay, well, we've given them enough publicity,
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.660]   although they could be a sponsor the way you're going.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.380]   Actually, it was Starbucks.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.220]   I believe it was Starbucks who was suggested a morning show.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.540]   Well, coffee, that makes sense, right?
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.380]   Coffee morning.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.140]   I would go for it.
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.940]   And do it out in New York City.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:16.900]   And when you get to that place,
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.420]   make sure there's a bedroom attached.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.060]   It's not going to matter, John.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.540]   The entire world is going to be covered with ash,
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.540]   and you won't be able to fly anywhere.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.380]   Now, the promoted tweets got a lot of coverage,
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.300]   because it's their business.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.460]   But there's a lot of other stuff.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:36.900]   But then there's this API developer controversy,
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.940]   because Twitter has officially anointed a few apps
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.020]   as their official clients.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.460]   They bought Tweety.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.980]   They've created one for the Blackberry,
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.980]   and they say they're creating one for Android as well.
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.460]   And I would imagine-- and I said, Gina, this as well,
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.340]   that developers might be up in arms.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.980]   And yet, there are people doing new Twitter clients.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.460]   And in fact, she mentioned one that was kind of clever,
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.060]   that would have some filtration in it.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:04.220]   So you could say, I'd like to control a little bit more--
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.820]   more ways of controlling what I see, or--
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.060]   I think there's opportunities.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.380]   Hey, what's this thing on Twitter?
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.300]   And it showed up.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.180]   It's a little icon that shows up in your generalized stream.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:14.980]   It's the retweet.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.260]   The retweeting, but--
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.460]   It's like a recycle icon.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.980]   Yeah, but the half the people that I look at my regular--
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.700]   I'm not following these people.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.260]   That's just the new way to do retweet,
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.660]   is to show who it came from originally.
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.740]   And then it'll say retweeted by X.
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.740]   And that's a person you are following.
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:32.740]   It's a little confusing.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.100]   I admit, I was baffled by it when I first saw it.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:36.940]   I don't like it.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.140]   I don't like it one bit.
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.100]   I don't like it at all.
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:39.940]   I don't follow it.
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.940]   I try to have a limited number of people
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.140]   I follow for good reason.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.540]   Well, in the old days, you would have just seen
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.380]   the person who retweeted it.
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.300]   So it is somebody you're following retweeting it.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.740]   It's just they're giving attribution
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.820]   to the original author, if you will.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:59.900]   I bet you that if there were someone out there who were kind
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.660]   of a hippie, he might have something to say about--
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:03.500]   Someone's brother.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.420]   Someone's brother or other?
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:06.380]   Or other.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.980]   Might have something to say about Twitter.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:13.580]   Well, as soon as I get through the ad, what am I complaining
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:13.780]   about?
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.980]   We got ads, too.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.140]   This is an ad for-- what is that an ad for?
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.020]   Do not miss this film.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.460]   Oh, this is kickass.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:19.940]   Yeah.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:21.340]   Apparently he's dying at the box office.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.020]   Is it really?
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.380]   Boy, they were really at South By.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.860]   They were really interested in seeing kickass.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.020]   Long lines.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.140]   That comic is actually on the iPad, on Comixology.
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:30.540]   Is it?
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:31.460]   If you want to catch up?
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.100]   So what's the best comic app on the iPad?
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.540]   I like Comixology the best.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.340]   Better than Marvel.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.180]   Marvel gets all the attention.
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.940]   Well, the Marvel app is made by Comixology.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:38.460]   Oh, interesting.
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.420]   And it's just Marvel.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.820]   So this one has Marvel and other publishers.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.100]   Got it.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.460]   So here's-- let's see what the tech hippie has to say.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.420]   Hey, man, what is this Twitter tweeting bull crap?
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.860]   That's it.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.860]   That was it?
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:55.940]   That's all I have to say.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:57.060]   Yes, sir.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.700]   Who is this guy?
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.220]   You look--
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:02.540]   A game heavy rain, man.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.900]   They had a heavy rain in Berkeley, man.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.300]   What does his shirt say?
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.300]   That is--
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.460]   Are you checking me out?
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:13.740]   Is that what--
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.940]   Checking me out.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.860]   It was a Nintendo shirt.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.620]   Oh, am I--
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.740]   Am I me?
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:19.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.940]   And then of course he's wearing a Sheriff's department
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:24.460]   thing over a shirt over that--
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.540]   he's the layers.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:26.060]   Layers.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.940]   And then of course, the piece thing, which is--
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.300]   Now the piece bling, we can't--
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.460]   It's bling.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.380]   It was like--
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.540]   It's kind of like Woody Harrelson's character from 2012.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.100]   I hate you, man.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.940]   Hey, man, what's the story about virtual money?
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:44.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:47.060]   John, you're a fertile, fertile, fertile man.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.340]   I can't get a job as an actor.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.420]   I can't understand why.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.620]   Twitter also is--
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.460]   Or other good, I think.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.700]   Added something new to the API called annotation, which
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.660]   I think could be potentially very interesting,
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.100]   where you can annotate tweets with--
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:04.140]   I think it's 500 bit bytes of pairs, like weather equals.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.060]   But they don't specify--
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.020]   it could be nice, it could be sunny, it could be rainy,
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:08.780]   it could be anything.
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.140]   So it's like geotagging, except for other stuff.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:11.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.180]   Because you can geotay.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:12.700]   You can--
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:12.700]   Right.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.020]   That's the only annotation you can do right now, right?
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.340]   That's a standard.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.220]   That's a longitude and latitude or it's a city name.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:20.540]   This could be anything, weather equals hippie.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.380]   And then you don't specify that.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.340]   So the developer decides where it's going to pull that.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.180]   You don't put that in.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.220]   Yeah, the client, I guess, could use it somehow.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:31.660]   No, you don't-- well, you could maybe have a client that
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:32.500]   would let you put it in.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:32.940]   I don't know.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.540]   Yeah, I guess you could.
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.060]   You could program the client to say, add your weather right
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.500]   now, and you could make it safe, Nord, or whatever you want.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.220]   Fennord.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.900]   Fennord.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:47.620]   Twitter has 105 million registered users,
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:51.620]   22.3 million unique visitors in March.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:55.020]   They are adding 300,000 a day.
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:56.420]   I wonder what the-- what the--
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.020]   what-- how they monetize each user.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.460]   It would be a minimum of 10 bucks.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.980]   Actually, according to Twitter, I'm sorry.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.580]   I said 22.3 million.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.700]   That's the probably like a comm score number.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.780]   Yeah, that's comm score number.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.500]   Twitter's own number, 180 million.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:10.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.860]   So that would be-- that puts the company at about 2 billion
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:14.620]   minimum.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.620]   There was that value.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:18.860]   That valued your followers at $3.60 on average.
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:19.380]   Wow.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.260]   I don't think that would be the same for monetizing it
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.260]   as a company for sure.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:22.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.140]   And here's the deal on why you want
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.340]   to have a third party client.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.340]   75% of the traffic to twitter.com doesn't come to twitter.com.
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.340]   It's from a client.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.220]   Now, do you think the developers have a beef here
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.300]   where they're like, hey, wait a minute.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:37.060]   We made all these clients for you, and you fostered that,
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.660]   and got us to start businesses around this.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.540]   And now you've anointed one, and we're left out in the cold.
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.060]   You know, if you develop on top of somebody's platform,
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:47.460]   whether it's Twitter, or Facebook, or Google, you just--
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.260]   I think as a developer, you know this is life.
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.140]   You've dealt with Microsoft, haven't you?
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:52.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:53.900]   Or Apple.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.260]   Right.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.580]   They said the stage.
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.620]   They seem to be shocked these developers.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.140]   Oh, I believe this.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.700]   I wonder if the people who are shocked
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:05.580]   are actually third party client developers or just people.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.500]   Troublemakers.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.500]   Hacker.News or slash.readers.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.420]   I could see the developers being upset
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.140]   that they didn't get picked.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.260]   They're like, wait, you bought tweet.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.060]   Well, they still haven't picked an Android application,
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:19.140]   so there's some competition going on.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.420]   And I think you're right.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.020]   You can have an official Twitter client,
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.740]   just like you have an official Facebook client,
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.500]   and still have other apps that do other things.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.100]   I think that's the key, is that as always with a developer,
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.220]   you've got to find a unique niche.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.700]   Did you-- you must have heard the 8-bit--
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.660]   this has nothing to do with anything.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.060]   We talked about this on current geek weekly.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:37.900]   I thought you might.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.340]   8-bit dark side of the moon.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.540]   This is hysterical.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.940]   Somebody has taken Brad Smith.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:45.660]   Brad Smith.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.980]   Well done, Brad Smith.
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.100]   Let me just play you.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:48.820]   I don't know why.
