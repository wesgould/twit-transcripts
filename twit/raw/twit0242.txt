[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.820]   It's time for TWIT.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.540]   This week in tech, the show that covers everything
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.820]   you'd like to go in the week's technology news, which
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.660]   this week is pretty much down to iPad, iPad, iPad.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.940]   Joining us to converse about this stellar, stunning,
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.020]   scintillating topic.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.500]   Jason iPad-Calicanis from mohalo.com.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.020]   Hello.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.540]   Hello.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.100]   How are you guys doing?
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.580]   I'm here with my solid gold iPad.
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.500]   Yes, I've had it plated in platinum.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.700]   You can't hit any of the buttons anymore, but it looks good.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.580]   Who needs to hit the buttons?
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.220]   Robert Scobel, who is playing his spiral piano.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.980]   That's another one of those apps from the Ocarina Fellows, right?
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.980]   Schmührer.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.980]   Schmührer.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.780]   Schmührer.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.820]   And for a first time-- and I'm really
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.340]   glad to have her--
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.300]   Jeannie Jardin of Boing Boing.net.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.260]   It's good to see you, Ajani.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.100]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.700]   What was that?
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.020]   Oh, stop it.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.660]   I couldn't hear you.
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.540]   I was optimizing our iPad edition.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.100]   We're only allowed to have people who
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.660]   have iPads on the show today.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.500]   Actually, we were going to get Corey Dr. O'Hanna.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.900]   Maybe we will get Corey on next week.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.460]   You should.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.940]   He has a pretty strong case against the iPad, which
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.860]   we'll talk about in a second.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.980]   But we have a bit of business we've
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.260]   got to take care of before we do that.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.420]   A couple of weeks ago, Kevin Rose was on the show.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.580]   And we were talking about Conan O'Brien
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.540]   and how he had picked a random Twitter follower, a random
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.820]   Twitter person to follow.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.660]   He hadn't followed anybody, I guess.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.820]   And so we thought, oh, we'll do the same thing.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.540]   It'd be kind of fun.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.060]   So we followed a woman named Lisa Tikkels Pink.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.500]   She had just started her Twitter account.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.860]   In fact, the way Kevin found her,
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.580]   he did a search for I Hate Technology.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.860]   And she showed up.
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.060]   He'd just been in New Zealand.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.140]   So he thought, oh, this is great.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.060]   She's in Auckland, New Zealand.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.900]   She hates technology.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.540]   She just started to join Twitter.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.340]   She has no followers.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.060]   So three weeks later, she now has 30,462 followers.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.420]   And I have a guilty conscience because the poor woman
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.420]   didn't have any idea.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.980]   We didn't warn her.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.820]   We didn't ask her permission.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.700]   We just swarmed her.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.940]   Now, the good news is she's very happy about it.
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.780]   In fact, Lisa's going to be joining us a little later
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.020]   on on the show to talk about her experience.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.100]   Going from 0 to 30,000 in three weeks.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.300]   We are going to give her an iPad as kind of a little bit
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.340]   of a payment for her trouble.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.860]   And because you can't get one in New Zealand.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.060]   So we've got one-- the box is right here.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.860]   All packaged up to ship to her.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.740]   But we had something happen to the factory.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.820]   And we accidentally got an extra one.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.020]   So I think what we're going to do
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.900]   is we're going to give one of these
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.780]   to a random follower of Lisa.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.860]   So Jason, now you have perfected this giving stuff
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.860]   to random followers thing.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.740]   Absolutely I have.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.500]   We can just go to that site I talked about.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.380]   Yeah, let me do that.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.900]   I could do that.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.900]   We'll do it on camera.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.260]   But just before we do, we're going to just see,
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.940]   what is the current number of followers now?
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.340]   It's 30,701 followers.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.420]   So from that, we're going to pick a random--
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.580]   so what do you just put-- you just put Lisa tickled pink in here,
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.340]   right?
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.740]   Correct.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.060]   This is twitrand.com.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.060]   And I'm going to pick from her followers.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.380]   And we will get a random follower.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.860]   And that person is going to win a 16 gigabyte iPad.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.860]   Are you ready?
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.860]   [GUNSHOT]
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.860]   I'm ready.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.860]   [GUNSHOT]
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260]   Error loading Twitter data, please check your username.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.620]   It sounds to me like when you put out the URL--
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.100]   I believe I--
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.500]   1,000 twit fans just--
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.980]   I broke it.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.980]   --can't have the site up.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.940]   Well, let's try that one more time.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.140]   Yeah, we broke it.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.140]   OK, we'll do this later in the show.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.380]   I could also pick one of the random followers on our list.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.540]   You have another program that you use to do this?
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.100]   I mean, the thing is we've got to vet it.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.460]   Because we've got to make sure it's really--
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.980]   it's truly a random number generator.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.260]   There is a random number generator.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.780]   I think it's random.org.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.260]   Yeah, I could just use that, huh?
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.060]   Yeah, so what I could do is we could pull up her follower list
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.740]   and see how many pages of it there are, put in that number,
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.100]   and then--
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.140]   Yeah, or I could just shoot myself now.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.700]   Let's just-- we'll do this later.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.660]   Do you have something on your iPad, Robert Scoble
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.180]   that will do this automatically?
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.140]   What is that?
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.340]   Oh, you're playing that game?
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.860]   I'm crashing.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.260]   Yeah, because you're doing it backwards.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.340]   All right, so today was the day the--
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.340]   or yesterday, Saturday was the day the iPad came out.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.620]   Did anybody wait in line, or did you all do the--
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.500]   well, first of all, Jenny, I know you didn't wait in line,
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.140]   because you got one ahead of time.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.740]   Oh, you're muted.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.940]   You're muted, Jenny.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.580]   Push your button.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.220]   There you go.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.980]   No?
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.420]   Hello?
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.780]   Here we go.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.140]   How's that?
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.860]   Yes, there you go.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.540]   Yeah, got one a little bit ahead of time.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.020]   I actually wanted to go wait in line with the rest of our people,
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.940]   but was a little too tired from all the TV stuff that
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.740]   was happening on the--
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.140]   You were on every station in the world showing that.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.860]   It was ridiculous.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.860]   It was like I was Justin Bieber for a day.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.980]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.060]   Yeah, well, you had a-- you had Willie Wonka's Golden Ticket.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.220]   You had one of a few hundred iPads out there.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.420]   Jason, you had an iPad months ago,
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.540]   but it was a different-- I think a different model.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.300]   I have had the 2.0 model with the solar power
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.940]   with the two cameras and the virtual reality augmented Skype.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.540]   But yeah, it's a different version.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.100]   You'll see that about a year from now.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.940]   He usually puts it out a year later.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.140]   Jenny, give us the background.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.540]   She's had it for the longest.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.980]   How on earth did you wind up getting one?
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.140]   Did you get contacted by Steve himself or by PR?
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.100]   Did you request it?
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.100]   The first rule of iPad is that you don't talk about iPad.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.100]   Yeah, you probably have to sign some papers, don't you?
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.380]   Oh, of course.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.380]   Not anymore, though.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.460]   Right, you're out of an on-disclosure.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.420]   How does it go down?
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.260]   Do you give Mossberg and Pogue this third degree?
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.220]   Yes, of course.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.420]   Like, we can't get Mossberg on the show,
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.860]   but we've talked to Kara about it, and we certainly--
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.860]   In Broadstrokes.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.060]   And then certainly talk to David.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.060]   The people managing iPad launch reached out
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.500]   to a number of reviewers.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.660]   I don't know why I was on the list of reviewers,
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.340]   but I was there.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.700]   Had you been on that list before?
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.340]   Had you gotten advanced copies before?
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.900]   Sure.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.460]   OK.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.700]   So that's why.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.540]   Bling-bling is why.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.700]   You're a powerful journalist.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.060]   We have more than a dozen unique viewers per month.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.340]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.780]   That'll do it.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.740]   So how long before the launch, they contact you and say,
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.220]   hey, you're a candidate for this,
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.620]   and how long did you have it like two days or two weeks?
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.740]   About a week ahead of time.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.740]   Long enough to not let the device part from my hands
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.780]   day or night and get a real good sense of how I might use that
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.500]   and how other people in my life would be likely to use it.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.540]   You know, Andy Inaco, who does Mac Break Weekly with us
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.180]   and writes for the Chicago Sun Times, also
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.500]   got one ahead of time.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.580]   He says he went to New York City to pick it up.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.100]   And of course, you sign extensive NDAs,
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.780]   and one of the things you cannot let anybody see it.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.220]   And so he's got in his backpack.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.260]   He's on the train back to Boston.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.620]   He's talking about this on the show.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.820]   He said, this is the hardest thing I ever did.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.180]   I've got a two-hour train ride, and I've got an iPad,
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.180]   and I can't use it.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.780]   It was pretty excruciating.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.820]   I bet it was.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.980]   I bet it was.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.660]   So they populated with apps, I'm sure.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.500]   Yeah, with some of the few iPad-ready apps
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.340]   that were available a week out, and as memory serves here,
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.820]   I'm just looking down now.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.420]   So the Reuters News app Epicurious, the Marvel Comics app,
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.660]   the Elements, some of those were actually
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.580]   ended up being my favorite.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.460]   But it was kind of magical, like on Friday evening,
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.740]   to see the iPad section of the App Store
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.700]   populate with tons and tons and tons of new apps.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.460]   Like, I mentioned that Starwalk app on Rachel Maddow's
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.700]   show Friday night.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.500]   That for me, I mean, maybe it's because I love science.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.300]   I love astronomy.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.460]   But between that and the Elements,
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.780]   I can think of no stronger case for why this device
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.460]   and why others like it are really kind of a compelling hint
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.340]   into the future.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.020]   Yeah, one of the things I noticed was how much nicer
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.780]   the native iPad apps look.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.420]   I mean, it's as if people said, oh,
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.620]   we've got to make this look great because it's on the screen.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.100]   And there's just-- even the ones that were just universal apps
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.460]   upgraded really look so much nicer.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.660]   You know, it was fun going back to some of the iPhone apps
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.340]   and even just going back to your iPhone after that.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.580]   It's like everything shrunk.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.020]   The iPhone does seem almost too small to use now.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:01.940]   I have to say.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.220]   It's like going from a 9-inch TV to a 50-inch TV.
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.460]   Just that alone is a big qualitative and quantitative
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.300]   difference.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.420]   I don't know enough about the details yet,
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.980]   but it also feels like they really
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.300]   jacked up the sensitivity on the touchscreen as well.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.260]   There's fewer sort of mis-swipes, mish taps.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.340]   Again, the difference is really more than the sum
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.540]   of the individual parts, it seems.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.820]   It really is a gorgeous screen.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.820]   It's very responsive.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.140]   I think that's one of the first things
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.460]   that you see when you--
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.940]   a lot of people who didn't like the idea of the iPad,
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.500]   then hold it.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.580]   And the responsiveness and the speed of it
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.620]   kind of wins you over very quickly.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.460]   It does.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.260]   Now, your colleague, Corey Doctorum,
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.660]   wrote a blog post right before the iPad came out
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.620]   saying, why I won't get an iPad and why you shouldn't either.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.180]   And one of the things he mentioned-- in fact,
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.460]   I'm looking at the Marvel comic book app right now--
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.020]   is that he loves comic books.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.060]   And this is exactly the antithesis
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.260]   of what he thinks makes the comic book culture so great.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.220]   You can get a great comic book.
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.180]   It looks great on here, but you can't share it.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.020]   You can't sell it.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.340]   You've got the only copy of this particular comic book.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.340]   It's copy protected.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.900]   Well, I'm not here to uphold or debate the points in Corey's
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.380]   and Corey.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.180]   He speaks well from himself.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.380]   Very capable of doing that.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.740]   But in that one instance, I would say, consider the fact
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.700]   that Apple did not make that app.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.860]   Marvel made that app.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.060]   And what you're looking at there has to do with Marvel
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.260]   and with Disney and with the other people involved
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.420]   in rights issues with the content that they distribute.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.580]   Apple did not require them to wrap their content in DRM
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.500]   or make it impossible for you to share that.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.980]   That's not a function of the device.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.780]   Right.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.820]   Well, in fact, I was thrilled to see
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.620]   that they put the Kindle app on here.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.780]   Right away, too, Friday night, like right around 6.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.060]   And Amazon updated it to be iPad specific.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.820]   And frankly, it is, I would say, as good a reading
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.780]   experience as the native iBook app.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.420]   Sure.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.700]   And some of the limitations that people have pointed out
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.020]   with the iBooks app, which is a delight in terms of usability,
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.220]   the fact that I think you can't--
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.940]   well, just some of the issues that Corey raised,
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.260]   those-- some things are different in the Kindle app.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.700]   So you have some freedoms with Kindle that you don't with iBooks.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.700]   The device itself doesn't impose those restrictions.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.780]   It has to do with the apps and the content arrangements
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.660]   that lie on it.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.020]   You know, I think one of the things--
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.660]   I'd love to hear Jason and Robert, your thoughts on this.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.540]   One of the things a lot of people were critical of the iPad
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.980]   before it came out, comparing it to a computer,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.620]   saying, well, you can get a half-price netbook that
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.020]   has cameras and multitasking and flash support
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.660]   and does everything that iPad does and more.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.500]   And it strikes me now having used the iPad for a couple of days
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.220]   that that's not the comparison.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.180]   That really, a more apt comparison would
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.620]   be to compare an iPad to, say, a television set,
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.820]   a content consumption device.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.940]   And if you compare it at that level, then the price
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.980]   and the capabilities are--
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.380]   it's like a 21st century TV set to me.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.780]   Or compared to Xbox or PlayStation, which are not--
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.340]   they're somewhat interactive, but you can't create
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.060]   your own video game on an Xbox really easily,
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.580]   unless you're a hardcore game company.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.100]   So my thought was, it's OK.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.340]   The code exists, right?
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.820]   It's not an easier-of-some game.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.180]   You can have both an iPad and a computer.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.380]   Right.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.140]   What do you think about that, Patrick?
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.900]   You talk to me about that.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:38.820]   The iPad feels different than your MacBook.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.740]   Yeah, as soon as you put it in your hands,
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.460]   you really get sort of engrossed in it.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.820]   You want to use it, which is kind of interesting.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.500]   It's a different field than a laptop.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.780]   But I think it's comparable.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.420]   I think you could compare it to a laptop,
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.460]   depending on what you use it for.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.700]   If you're not a hardcore computer user,
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.940]   I think this could serve you just as well as a--
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.380]   Yeah, most people use email and surf the web.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.780]   And if that's your usage pattern, this thing does really well.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.940]   Now, if you are like me and Dave Weiner,
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   and you create content and do videos,
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.540]   and you want to get into Photoshop,
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.180]   and you want to maybe get into Second Life,
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.060]   and play around and create things, this falls apart.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.140]   But you can still do that.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.500]   I'm going to be saying you can't do that.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.060]   You just can't do it with this device anymore
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.860]   and you can do it with an Xbox 360 or a television set.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.700]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.540]   Dave Weiner almost immediately tweeted, "Oh, well, okay."
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.380]   It starts to-- I kind of like it.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.340]   It's not so bad.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.180]   He actually seems to have enjoyed it.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.340]   Well, that's the--
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.900]   That didn't last very long.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.100]   Oh, he went the other way again.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.020]   Oh, I got to keep up with his tweets.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.980]   Now he's grumpy again, huh?
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.620]   Yeah, he's cute.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.780]   Go ahead, Jason.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.660]   No, I was just saying.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.420]   This is the infuriating part about the device,
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.940]   and Steve Jobs' philosophy of product design.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.700]   It's the ultimate compelling consumption device.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.860]   Anybody falls in love with it.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.580]   The moment they start playing with it,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.060]   there are some really unique features to it.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.620]   And it's got just an incredible feel in your hand
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.500]   that I've not felt with any other device.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.380]   So I'm much more into an open-type platform
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.220]   that you can do some creation on.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.460]   But I love it as well.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.820]   And so you have to wonder, why is it
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.700]   that Steve Jobs insists on crippling the devices,
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.580]   not letting you put a USB port in,
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.460]   not letting you change your battery,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.100]   not letting you run, you know, opera or another browser.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.620]   I'm not going to speak for Steve Jobs, but I can--
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.540]   I'm glad he didn't.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.020]   It's a simple-- the idea is simplicity.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.940]   You know, we interviewed Wozniak.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.620]   He was out there with you, Robert, at the Palo Alto
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.420]   Apple Store the night before.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.940]   He was at Valley Fair.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.820]   Or Valley Fair, OK.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.940]   We interviewed him that night, Friday night.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.380]   And he said, I thought completely the salient point,
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.420]   which is this is, in a way, a reboot for personal technology.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.940]   It's gotten too complex.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.140]   Even he's the guy who built the Apple One and Apple Two.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.300]   And he says, this is simple and that's good.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.980]   Do you need a USB port on this?
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.260]   Well, I look at it differently.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.340]   It's almost like we're moving from the carburetor era of cars
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.420]   to the fuel injection era of cars.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.820]   And I remember the same argument
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.460]   is happening, especially around kids
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.620]   who love to tinker with their cars.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.420]   Getting inside a carburetor and replacing the carburetor
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.580]   and messing around with your air fuel mixture
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.780]   was really easy back in that era of cars.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.340]   And now we have fuel injection that's run by computers.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.700]   And you need to be a computer hacker
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.580]   to really control your air fuel era mixture in your car.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.620]   And that's a different thing.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.420]   But look at what is broadest in terms of reliability,
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.500]   and mileage, and other things.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.180]   And normal people don't want to learn about the air fuel
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.580]   mixture of their car.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.860]   They just want to turn on the key and drive.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.220]   I think this is a terrible analogy.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.500]   Why?
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.660]   Because, I think a webcam, which has been on the iPhone
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.980]   for over two years, right, is not the equivalent of--
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.580]   the equivalent for a carburetor would
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.820]   be opening the thing up and changing the memory chips.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.660]   Nobody's saying, change the memory chips.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.260]   What we are saying is--
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.180]   No, Dave, can I have a camera?
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.260]   Dave, why are you covering the complex for people, really?
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.220]   Dave Weiner and Corey Doctorow definitely
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.300]   made the point that they want to tinker with a device.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.860]   They want to build software for it.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.740]   They want to have an open platform
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.340]   that they don't have to convince the committee
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.260]   to distribute their software to.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.820]   And those are legitimate claims on this world.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.540]   Now, separate--
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.660]   That's how many features stand point.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.700]   Yeah, Steve Jobs takes away stuff every time he comes out
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.500]   with something new.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:48.580]   I guess the question is, are we cows and victims of Steve
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.740]   and just following along?
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.580]   Or is this a useful device, but we still got our computers.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.420]   We still got our camcorders.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.820]   We still got all the other devices.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.580]   It seems to me that you're not giving up anything
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.060]   by buying an iPad anymore than you would be by buying
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.420]   a television set.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:05.900]   Right?
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.860]   I mean--
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.980]   Do you think that there's going to be a consumer that--
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.060]   You don't want a camera on your TV set.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.580]   That's not needed.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.260]   Actually, that's coming, by the way.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.580]   Ah, yeah, but I don't want it.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.020]   I know.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.620]   But who nobody really wants.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.220]   And what about you?
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:19.720]   Not true.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.380]   Wait until you see the next Xbox.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.700]   It has a camera that watches your interaction,
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.620]   and you play video games by doing gestures to the camera.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.660]   Project napalm.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:35.180]   Jenny, what do you think on this?
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.460]   Is that a reasonable response to people like Corey?
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.100]   Look, this doesn't exclude all of those great things
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.580]   that the digital revolution has brought us?
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.340]   It's a first generation device.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.260]   I think it's been interesting to watch
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.940]   a range of people arguing about this on Twitter.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.420]   Looking at the iPad as a successor to or something
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.980]   that is supposed to combine different functions,
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.260]   different roles that are familiar to us.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.780]   Those of us who remember what computing was like 10, 15,
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.420]   20 years ago might feel a sense of frustration,
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.140]   or there might be some kind of friction for us
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.020]   in adopting this.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.900]   Because no, it's not a net book.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.100]   No, it's not a phone.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.580]   No, it's not your TV set.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.980]   No, it's not your book.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.660]   But it has the capability to take elements of all those things,
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.420]   and the Xbox, and the Wii, and whatever,
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.780]   and merge them in new and interesting ways.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.300]   Some of the folks in the chat room
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.580]   that I'm following here in the Twitter IRC,
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.020]   someone just mentioned that the teardown photos
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.740]   that we blogged on Boing Boing yesterday from,
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.460]   I think I fix it,
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.100]   indicates that there may be space for a camera.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.460]   I would be really surprised.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.080]   I mean, I mentioned this on the 27th of January,
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.940]   when they did the big unveil in San Francisco.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.260]   I mentioned this to one of the iPad handlers
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.540]   in the shrouded room where us journalists
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.420]   got 10 minutes of fondle time with minders.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.220]   I said, I think it's interesting
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.700]   that this device doesn't have a camera,
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.940]   and I didn't get a definitive response there,
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.340]   but I didn't get a, no, this device
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.460]   will never have a camera either.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.820]   - Yeah, one thing that I know about Apple's internals,
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.940]   'cause my brother-in-law works on the eye.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.580]   - There's more like San Francisco right now.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.420]   - You're kidding.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.260]   - Are you shaking?
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.520]   - There's a big earthquake right now.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.600]   - You can feel it?
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.480]   - Yes.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.440]   - Holy cow.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.280]   - I don't feel it.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.280]   - Can you feel it?
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.120]   - No.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.000]   - Maybe just a truck.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.840]   - It's big.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.920]   (laughing)
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.480]   - This is, actually, this is big.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.800]   Everything in my house is shaking.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.640]   - Oh boy.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.480]   - Wow.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.800]   - Holy crap.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.000]   - I don't feel it in Brentwood.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.840]   - Huh.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.660]   - Whoa.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.600]   Do you feel that?
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.320]   Hey, nothing.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.720]   - Not here in San Francisco.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.900]   (laughing)
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.440]   - This is actually really big.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.660]   - All right, so--
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.500]   - It starts by--
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.620]   - It starts by when I do when there's an earthquake.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.180]   I pull up search.twitter.com,
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.540]   and I start searching on the word earthquake.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.900]   - It should have a pretty quick link.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.620]   - Just a watch of all the tweets that come in.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.320]   And then, Leo, can you pull up USGS website?
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.300]   - Yeah, let me pull that up before everybody else does.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.360]   - There's also one in Baja, Mexico eight minutes ago.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.520]   - That was like a good 20 seconds, you guys.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.360]   - That's a long time.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.660]   - USGS website will have the epicenter
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.260]   in about four minutes or less.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.420]   - Holy crap, it's still swaying.
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.300]   - Hmm.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.660]   Are you in a wooden building, Jenny?
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.060]   Where are you?
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.020]   And where exactly are you in LA?
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.700]   - Okay, there's definitely an earthquake happening
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.700]   'cause I see it on Twitter.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.540]   (laughing)
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.540]   - It must be real.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.380]   - Twitter is Twitter.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.200]   - It's funny.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.040]   It's funny.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.880]   Nobody believed her.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.720]   - Twitter is my reality, I'm sure.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.620]   - Nobody believed her until we saw it on Twitter.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.460]   - Right.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.460]   - Yeah, Twitter has lots of earthquake, LA earthquake.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.300]   Just felt a nice--
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.620]   - Yeah, I wasn't just getting the vapors
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.260]   'cause I was so excited about the iPad.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.100]   - Are you okay?
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.620]   Is everything all right, Jenny, before we--
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.460]   - Everything's fine.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.500]   I just saw all the plants hanging from my ceiling going,
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.340]   whoa!
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.900]   - Oh, wow.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.740]   - And are you in downtown?
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.580]   Where are you?
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.100]   - It says 6.9 in Baja.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.700]   - So that's a fairly sizable earthquake.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.020]   - Baja's not that close.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.300]   - No, I know, but it seems--
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.700]   - I'm not in Baja.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.340]   I'm on the west side of LA right now,
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.620]   and I'm in a big kind of warehouse building at the moment.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.980]   So no, it's not wooden and it's God willing,
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.620]   it's earthquake proof.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.380]   We can go back to talking about technology.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.780]   - That's okay, because you'll be able to watch it live
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.860]   on that Twitch.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.020]   - Yeah, I'm actually following your IRC channel
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.140]   and everyone is posting data.
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.260]   - It's fun when you Google earthquakes.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.260]   Google now shows a recent earthquakes result.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.100]   It's part of it.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.820]   - Yeah, USGS is showing 6.9, 16 miles south-southwest
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.540]   of Guadalupe, Victoria, Mexico.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.180]   - You know, four minutes ago, that's probably about right.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.540]   You're probably feeling it takes a while to go through the--
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.540]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.460]   (laughing)
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.540]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.580]   - Is there any, it's interesting that you experienced it
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.700]   as a very rolling, very long lesson.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.620]   That would tell you you're not close to the epicenter
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.460]   because if you're close to the epicenter,
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.300]   it's very sharp and very--
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.740]   - It's a sudden, yeah.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.500]   - You know, that's interesting, Skoll.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.500]   There's been times in the past when,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.900]   in the past few months even, when we've had quakes
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.100]   that were very, very close to where I am,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.220]   either in downtown LA or just,
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.860]   I think there was one off of Catalina
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.380]   and there was this big abrupt kind of jolt,
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.900]   but it was very short.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.460]   This is the longest quake I've felt here or anywhere
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.460]   in quite a while, but it wasn't so violent and shallow.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.220]   God, Lee.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.300]   Okay.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.780]   - It's good. (laughing)
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.780]   - I love that, that's real time.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.620]   - I staged that by the way that's my chance.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.940]   - The iPad shakes the world.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.020]   (laughing)
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.660]   - The US move for me.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.660]   I think Steve Jobs is getting a little bit upset at us,
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.340]   questioning the device and he just shook the earth.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.300]   - This is a message to people in Los Angeles, calm down.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.780]   I'll put a camera in when I'm ready.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.100]   - Somebody ate too many marshmallow peeps.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.940]   (laughing)
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.740]   - It might have been me.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.900]   I've been devouring these peeps she.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.100]   It says sushi made out of peeps
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.740]   with rice crispy treats instead of rice,
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.020]   peeps instead of fish and the seaweed is actually fruit roll up.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.500]   It's quite flavorful.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.660]   - I would like you all to just note
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.500]   that I did not run to safety.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.420]   - You were good.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.940]   There's a journalist.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.140]   She's a journalist for you.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.900]   She stayed there reported.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.740]   - All right.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.660]   - I love it.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.500]   Of course we didn't believe you
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.380]   'cause nothing was shaken.
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.980]   The camera was rock steady, I thought.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.140]   (laughing)
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.980]   She's losing it, folks.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.100]   She's gone.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.740]   CNN has actually started covering it,
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.180]   so it must be true.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.020]   - Okay.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:29.860]   - Must be true.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.060]   - Don't trust me, but you trust Twitter.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.300]   - Yeah, well that's what's interesting.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.020]   Twitter is 7,000 more results
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.740]   since I started searching a minute ago, 8,000.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.620]   I mean, it's really interesting how this happens.
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.940]   So that's a good question.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.420]   A few years ago you would go to USGS
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.500]   or you do what I do with Google earthquakes.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   Now you go to Twitter.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.700]   - Well, the problem is Twitter
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.220]   doesn't really tell you where it is
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.540]   or the magnitude of it
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.060]   because if you're really close to the epicenter,
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.260]   even a smaller earthquake
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.980]   can sometimes seem like major to you.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.180]   And that's why I instantly start going to USGS
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.300]   and refreshing that page to see how big it--
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.020]   - Well, it might say something about you or the reader,
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.900]   but where are you more interested in the number
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.500]   or what people are saying about it, you know?
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.020]   - Both, because you know, you notice what we all did.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.420]   We went to different places on the internet
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.300]   to learn about this event.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.020]   We were watching Zini experience it live
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.860]   and now we can see on Twitter
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.820]   what our friends are saying, on Facebook,
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.340]   on Google.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.660]   I mean, there's a lot of places
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.060]   that we're gonna get really fast information.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:37.900]   - Yep.
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.940]   - Just for the record,
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.300]   there are people reporting earthquake in Arizona,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.660]   San Diego and Los Angeles.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.980]   - That must be that far.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.980]   - Is it 2012 already?
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.700]   - 6.9, it's fairly, that's a strong earthquake.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.540]   - Yeah.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.100]   - It's a strong-- - It wouldn't be surprised
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.900]   you'd feel it in some pretty distant places.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:56.820]   So we're gonna take a break.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.660]   I wanna come back.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.820]   We do have a lot more iPad talk,
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.580]   including the surprising stat
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.420]   that as many as perhaps 700,000 iPods
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.700]   were sold in day one.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.340]   Is that credible? - I bet.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.180]   - Is that credible?
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.100]   We'll find out in just a little bit,
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.660]   but I wanna take a little break
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.540]   to talk about my friends at squarespace.com.
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.500]   Squarespace is a great place to make your website.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.260]   Somebody, a friend asked me yesterday, she said,
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.940]   I've got the domain name and I wanna sell some stuff,
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.780]   but I don't know where to go to make my website.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.860]   And I started saying, well, you know,
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.580]   I could get your hosting
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.540]   and then you get any new content management system.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.580]   By the time I finished, I realized, wait a minute.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.100]   Squarespace, of course.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.580]   This is the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.860]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.780]   You could try it free.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.020]   No credit card required, really is free.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.460]   And it's got everything that my friend was asking for.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.980]   Great templates.
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.740]   In fact, if you go look at the example sites,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.060]   you'll see that no two squarespace sites look alike.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.860]   And that's what you want.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.180]   You know, you can't say, oh, that's a squarespace site.
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.100]   They all look different.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.260]   They all look beautiful.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.740]   That's 'cause squarespace starts
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.100]   with beautiful designer templates
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.580]   then lets you easily with drag and drop customize it
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.580]   to fit your needs.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.860]   They've got great stats.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.740]   So you can find out who's visiting your site.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.140]   An iPhone app that is to die for.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.540]   And I'm sure that we updating that for the iPad too.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.860]   That's gonna be the new thing for bloggers is,
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.180]   I mean, what a great way to blog.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.380]   If it only had a camera.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.300]   Also a social integration with Twitter and Facebook
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.460]   and YouTube and Dig and all of the other sites.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.380]   Photo galleries.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.300]   They're just gorgeous.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.820]   Form building and data collection.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.980]   And you could try it free for two weeks.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.060]   Get 10% off for the life of your site.

[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.380]   If you decide to move on, you won't.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.460]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.660]   Really great people making great sites.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.100]   Starting at $8 a month.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.060]   Free for the first two weeks.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.780]   I just made a site while you're doing the commercial.
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.060]   It's that easy.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.500]   I just go to ipadearthquake.squarespace.com.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.900]   No, you didn't really?
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.820]   ipadearthquake.squarespace.com.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.580]   Literally halfway into the commercial.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.620]   I said, let me try out squarespace.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.940]   And I got a site up and running and changed the template.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.700]   You did it faster than I can actually go to it.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.700]   (laughing)
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.060]   I'm gonna get an earthquake boom.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:18.900]   (laughing)
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.300]   I'm ready to go.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.140]   This is great.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.300]   There's any additional ipadearthquakes.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.900]   I'm gonna be number one in Google.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.980]   (laughing)
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.220]   I got it on these.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.860]   If everybody could tweet this for me,
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.700]   that would be helpful.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.940]   It's all about the SEO, isn't it?
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.940]   Absolutely.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.780]   (laughing)
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.620]   I love it.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.460]   Absolutely.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.300]   (laughing)
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.300]   I mean, look at that's how easy it is.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.860]   'Cause you didn't have to add a credit card or anything.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.260]   It's just very straightforward.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.940]   I do think, you know, I know a couple of people said,
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.300]   "Oh, I got the WordPress app on here."
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.620]   Now, even though it's not for ipad yet,
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.580]   they start thinking and blogging.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.780]   'Cause the ipad just seems like,
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.020]   it feels like you might take this to a coffee shop
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.260]   and you might just feel like writing.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.980]   How is the keyboard for you?
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.380]   Jenny, what do you think of the keyboard?
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.260]   Is it easy to write with?
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.100]   You know, it's funny.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.900]   When I first started using the iPhone,
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.460]   I felt a little frustration with typing an action.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.940]   But it will be okay a lot.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.260]   But after, like, there's these cutoff points after a week,
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.820]   after a couple of weeks, after four weeks,
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.420]   you learn this new motor skill, right?
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.020]   It's like learning to ride a bike.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.060]   And I can bang out quite a few words per minute now.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.260]   I'm feeling some of that same friction
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.940]   with the touchscreen keyboard on ipad.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.700]   I like it a lot more in landscape than I do in portrait.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.300]   But I also, they loan me one of the docs, the keyboard docs.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.580]   I like that a lot.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:38.100]   I could imagine easily, and I, in fact, intend to,
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.220]   purchasing one of the units with 3G
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.100]   so that I don't have to worry about
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.020]   whether or not there's a Wi-Fi connection.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.980]   You know, taking it to tech conferences,
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.620]   having the keyboard doc, you know, in my purse or my bag
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.940]   or whatever I'm carrying,
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.300]   and being able to compose longer posts or file reports
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.220]   using the doc or just touchscreen for tweet lengths
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.620]   or Facebook length or very short posts.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.340]   We've been doing these short-length posts on Boing Boing
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.300]   for a few months now.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.140]   It's something that my colleague Rob Biscuetze set up.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.020]   He's been doing a lot of interesting design tweaks with us.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.380]   And they're right about the length of a Twitter post.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.140]   So with something, with our own blog,
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.340]   with the medium and the voice of our blog evolving,
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.780]   I could imagine more short-form things.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.660]   And it's funny how there's this back and forth
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.140]   between the device and our voices
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.740]   and the format of the blog.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.740]   I look forward to it.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.900]   - Isn't it interesting how the device influences your style
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.740]   and your writing?
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.740]   I think that's fascinating.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.020]   - And how Twitter has as well.
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.700]   Like because of being forced to do 140 characters or less,
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.980]   I notice myself being more,
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.580]   being more brief on the blog as well.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.180]   It teaches you to conserve and editing and brevity
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.220]   are two of the greatest skills of any writer, I think.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.460]   - Yeah, 140 characters is definitely brevity.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.380]   I bought the Bluetooth keyboard, the little apple blut,
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.820]   which is really nice and light and small.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.260]   And it works beautifully with this.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.820]   In fact, as soon as you pair it and it pairs instantly,
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.820]   then you don't get the pop-up keyboard.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.180]   You just start typing on here.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.220]   Although, somebody told me, and this is a really great tip,
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.860]   I think I saw it on Gizmodo.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.460]   If you press the eject key on the Bluetooth keyboard,
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.700]   it will slide up the on-screen keyboard.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.940]   So you don't lose it, which was a nice little tip.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.900]   - Our Betty Joel Johnson pointed out earlier today,
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.380]   something that I hadn't really thought of,
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.940]   but it seems really silly that the apostrophe key is buried.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.340]   - Yes. - One layer deep.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.780]   - Yes, 'cause you hit it a lot.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.780]   I hit it a lot.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.620]   I need it.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.660]   - And it's nice that there's that smart correction,
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:46.420]   but it's, and it's yours, and that's a really common mistake.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.460]   - Right, it never knows which one to do.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.740]   - Well, I just downloaded one of the earthquake apps
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.900]   that's available in the store.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.260]   - So that Mappety.
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.820]   - Unfortunately, none of them are available for the iPad,
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.140]   and here's something that you can see
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.140]   that's wrong with the iPad.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.100]   You can buy iPhone apps, this is an iPhone app,
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.380]   but it's really small.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.820]   And then if you blow it up,
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.980]   the quality of it goes way down.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.060]   - Yeah.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.220]   - Yeah, it goes really bad.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.500]   - Some apps do better than others.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.380]   I've noticed, in fact, even games like Spider,
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.660]   which I love, actually blows up 2X pretty well,
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.500]   and looks pretty good.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.580]   I guess it depends on how the bitmaps are stored,
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.020]   and so forth.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.300]   I imagine, though, every single, okay,
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.820]   I'm gonna tell you one thing that's really pissing me off.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.420]   The number of companies, you know, you have a choice.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.260]   You can do a universal version of your app.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.540]   People like Evernote, release new versions,
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.460]   Kindle, new version, that have both iPad
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.300]   and iPhone iPod touch versions.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.940]   In a single app, no upgrade cost, very nice.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.100]   So when I launch my Evernote now, I love it.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.540]   It actually pulls up Evernote,
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.900]   full screen on the iPad, and it really is beautiful.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.140]   But how many companies, almost all of them,
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.340]   are coming out with iPad-specific versions
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.660]   for an additional $10 or more.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.660]   It's driving me crazy.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.500]   There's this land grab, this greed,
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.620]   that just making me nuts here.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.980]   - Yeah.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.460]   - And aren't iPad apps seem,
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.340]   they seem like they're much more expensive.
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.460]   - Yeah, five times as much.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.700]   - Why?
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.820]   - Yeah, why?
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.660]   - Why?
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.060]   - Because you have to pay for the pixels.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.420]   (laughing)
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.580]   - Cost per pixel is lower.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.060]   - It's always something with that.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:25.940]   - No, it drives me crazy.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.500]   Like New York Times already has an app.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.060]   Why are they doing it at Separate?
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.620]   Now they're not charging for it.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.820]   - There's four times more pixels, four times the cost, right?
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.700]   - It just drives me crazy, a big oven,
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.500]   which I really love.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.260]   Why are they selling a separate version?
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.780]   They could just make a universal version.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.460]   I already have it installed.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.780]   That was the first thing that drove me crazy
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.300]   is I synced my iPad and had hundreds of apps
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.220]   that I don't want to use 'cause they look so bad.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.060]   - And you know what?
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.820]   - This is an upgrade fee too,
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.300]   that you get a discount if you are reality.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.060]   - Yeah, Apple doesn't make that possible, unfortunately.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.500]   That's part of the problem.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.780]   - The Wall Street Journal did an awesome job
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.180]   because I'm a driver.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.580]   - Hold on, Robert, go ahead.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.220]   - Oh, I was just saying the Wall Street Journal
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.060]   was a delight.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.380]   I turned it on and I logged into my Wall Street Journal account.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.100]   I get it in print at the house,
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.140]   have the online and then it just works on the iPad.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.780]   So it's like one login.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.620]   - Yeah, we're not paying the $17.99.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.540]   I don't know when that's gonna kick in.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.700]   - No, I think it's gonna be free forever.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.540]   - For subscribers.
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.380]   - You get the print version.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.220]   - So you get back editions, which is nice.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.700]   Going back to Saturday last,
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.500]   so it's like it's a week worth of editions.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.580]   - And the video works in it.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.860]   - I tried logging in with a Wall Street Journal
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.660]   print subscription and I was blocked.
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.620]   Maybe I was doing something wrong,
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.820]   but I was blocked from downloading today's paper.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.580]   - I had an online subscription.
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.220]   Is yours online or is it print only, Jason?
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.380]   - Mine's print.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.220]   It's both.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.060]   - Ah, see, that's both.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.900]   See, I paid for the extra for the online
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.660]   and I think that that's probably why you and I can get on.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.020]   So, Shanna, you only have a print version.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.860]   - That's correct.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.780]   - Yeah, I think the only problem with the Wall Street Journal
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.660]   is it's like every other page.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.060]   - Isn't it?
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.180]   - I was like, are you kidding me?
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.140]   Like, how about one ad per session
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.020]   or two ads per session is more ads in it.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:06.860]   There you go.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.860]   More ads in it than in the paper.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.420]   - Oh, and they're offensive
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.060]   because they take over the whole screen in many cases.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:13.900]   - Yeah.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.740]   - If that was the free version,
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.940]   I wouldn't mind an ad every other page.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.260]   - Right, but I'm paying money for this.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.220]   - But if I'm paying already, like, can we just,
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.340]   I mean, I don't mind some ads.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.460]   And then it keeps a little ad in the bottom left.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.060]   It's a little red thing for Oracle.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.900]   - Thank you, Rur.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.740]   - Which I think is okay, but I mean--
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.940]   - That doesn't bother me as much.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.380]   And I notice a lot of the New York Times also,
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.740]   which is free, has a little ads on it.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.180]   But when they do the full screen ad,
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.740]   I mean, I guess, look, we do ads too.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.060]   But how can you charge the user a subscription
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.340]   for the digital version and then inundate them
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.980]   with invasive ads?
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.820]   - Yeah, because this is why--
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.660]   - Like it's one of the other.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:47.660]   - It's newspaper.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.260]   You know, you used to pay 50 or 100 bucks
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.540]   to get the print version.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.020]   You got all the ads with the print.
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:53.860]   - I guess.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.700]   - They're coming at the world
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.020]   as if it was still a newspaper world, you know?
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.340]   - Well, and this is what Jeff Jarvis has been saying
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.300]   on this week in Google and others have been saying
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.820]   is that for content creators,
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.140]   this is an opportunity for them to go retrograde,
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.660]   to go back to an era where they controlled
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.020]   distribution medium, they, you know,
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.420]   it wasn't the worldwide web.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.580]   And he's of the opinion.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.060]   I think a lot of, there's a big ad.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.060]   A lot of people are of the opinion
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.780]   that this is the last gasp for content companies
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.900]   trying to control everything so tightly.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.740]   - I don't think so.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.180]   I mean, go to a movie theater now.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.460]   You pay your 10 to, I think the movie prices in New Yorker
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.620]   up to $18 for a 3D movie.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.140]   And you guys sit through about 100 different ads
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.060]   before you even see the movie.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.220]   And there you're paying to get in the theater.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.300]   - Yeah, that's the reason crazy.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.460]   - And more for popcorn and everything else.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.780]   And then you guys sit through all the ads too.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.140]   So I think these guys are gonna treat us the same way.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.900]   You know, oh, we got a captive audience.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.540]   They want the New York Times.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.380]   Let's shove ads in their face.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.220]   - Well, I think that Jeff's point is
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.580]   that as long as you got a web browser,
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.940]   that that's the future of news.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.060]   And that's how people are gonna get their news.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.860]   - Yeah, on the cost of iPad apps, by the way,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.420]   some apps are going down in price,
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.980]   like tap tap radiation, tapuluses, game,
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.460]   used to cost, I think, three or four bucks.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.300]   Now it's free.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.700]   And now their business model has changed
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.060]   to have a little bit of advertising.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.540]   And then you buy music and things in the game
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.260]   that'll help them monetize.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.660]   And so they've gone the other way,
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.860]   which is give away the app for free.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.140]   You get people addicted to it
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.420]   and then sell things inside the app.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.900]   - As somebody who loves casual gaming,
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.260]   I have to say this is the best casual gaming platform
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.100]   I've ever seen.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.100]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.060]   What is the best casual game native to the iPad?
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.500]   - Well, if you haven't yet been hooked
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.860]   on Plants vs. Zombies, don't download it.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.180]   Do not download it.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.460]   Whatever you do, don't.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.300]   Too bad.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.580]   - Wait, are you saying Plants and Zombies available
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.420]   for iPads?
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.980]   - Yeah, this is the iPad version.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.660]   - One of the Apple folks who demoed the iPad for me
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.740]   first said that this was his absolute favorite game.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.100]   That was the one he was most psyched about.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.380]   Plants vs. Zombies for iPad.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.100]   - Well, and you know, this is a pop cap games.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.860]   They, what's interesting, these are flash games.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.620]   So obviously they're not written flash now.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.420]   And I think if pop cap is figured out how to put games
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.940]   like this, of course it does bejeweled
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.420]   on this platform watch out.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.780]   This is gonna be an incredible gaming platform.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.580]   - Wait, there's a version of bejeweled for this?
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.500]   - No, not yet.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.860]   But I have a feeling it's the same company
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.420]   that there will be.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.820]   - Yeah, Marc de Cio of Zinga who makes farm dough
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.220]   and stuff like that said he's converting all of his games
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.140]   to non flash so that he can get them onto the iPad iPhone
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.220]   and other platforms without worrying about it.
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.020]   - Is this the end for flash?
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.860]   - The iPad?
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.180]   - It's certainly the beginning of the, it's not the end
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.860]   but it certainly takes away a lot of the need for flash.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.260]   I mean, TED talks for instance, just last week
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.020]   turned on an HTML5 website
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.740]   so you could watch all of their videos on the iPad
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.740]   without having any flash involved.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.660]   And you can see, you can build casual games now
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.300]   without having flash. - We don't have flash.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.060]   - That was pretty hard to do, you know,
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.420]   two or three years ago.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.540]   Now, so Adobe, if I have a video on my YouTube channel
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.100]   with Adobe giving us the reason that flash is still relevant,
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.020]   they now look at it as hey, we have three million flash
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.180]   developers who know how to do flash
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.500]   but they don't necessarily know how to do Objective C
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.780]   or other languages.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.740]   So they're converting from a platform that runs Flash
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.060]   to a tool that will help iPhone developers
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.140]   build games using flash front ends.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:41.100]   So they already have a tool that converts Flash apps,
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.740]   not Flash in web pages but Flash apps
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.700]   into iPhone apps that can be, or iPad apps
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.940]   that can be distributed this way.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.220]   - What's your favorite game right now
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.220]   on the iPad anybody?
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.060]   - Patrick.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.220]   - Patrick, by the way, we should explain
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.580]   is Robert's a teenage son.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.300]   - Yeah, and he's the gamer in the family.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.580]   I don't play games.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.940]   He's playing right now.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.820]   - He's a sophomore in high school.
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:08.420]   - Turn on the audience so people can hear the audience.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.620]   - Oh, that's the driving game.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.580]   That's an amazing game.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.620]   You steer with the iPad.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.260]   - Yeah, which is actually a fairly good experience.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.220]   - It is, you don't find it the screen moving around
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.660]   is bugging you?
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.180]   - No, I actually don't 'cause it doesn't take a lot
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.380]   to move it and it actually works with how you play it.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.220]   - Right.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:29.980]   - I also played the Call of Duty Nazi Zombies game.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.060]   - That's fun.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.420]   - Did they upscale that?
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.620]   Did they make that for iPad?
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.500]   - Yeah, they do actually.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.340]   - Okay.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.180]   - Yeah.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.460]   - I just think for instance of crossword puzzles
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.660]   or scrabble, this is kind of such a natural
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.580]   for people who love crossword puzzles.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.620]   This is how you're gonna wanna do crossword puzzles
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.460]   I would think.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.660]   And it's, you know, the scrabble's $10 version
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.100]   is selling like hotcakes, but actually I prefer words
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.820]   with friends for $5.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.300]   It's a faux scrabble that you play online
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.820]   instead of via the Bluetooth.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.740]   And I think it's just really great.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.300]   I can't stop playing this Farmville clone.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.220]   God help me.
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.340]   God help me.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.380]   It's called We Rule.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.260]   Oh dear.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.060]   I thought I'd escape Farmville,
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.940]   but no, no, no, no.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.380]   We're gonna see a lot more, I think.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.420]   - Jenny, do you play any games on this thing?
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.820]   - Right now, Pat, this is the college of the game.
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.700]   - I'm not a big gamer, but I actually think
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:33.740]   that I may end up picking some new bad habits up
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.220]   thanks to the iPad.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.020]   The whole thing with scrabble with being able to use
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.820]   that helper app on your iPhone and sort of flick
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.580]   your letters onto the board remotely.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.580]   - Ooh, that's cool.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.740]   - Like that's not magic, that's crazy.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:45.500]   - Wait a minute, tell me about that.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.940]   That's the official scrabble version?
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.500]   The scrabble app for iPad is lovely.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.340]   - I'm gonna have to buy it, I guess.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.180]   - I don't know what that is.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.700]   - I forget what the name of the app is for iPhone,
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.300]   but there's a helper app that if you have, say,
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.380]   three people playing scrabble around the table
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.020]   and each of the players happens to have an iPhone
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.900]   and happens to have this app installed,
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:08.380]   you can set up your little deck or whatever you call it
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.300]   and just flick your letters onto the board.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.220]   (laughs)
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.060]   Right?
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.180]   - Yeah, we're gonna see a lot of things like that.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.140]   I'm sure because you got this Bluetooth,
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.780]   it's very quick and easy to pair and they talk to you.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.100]   - To me, even just that design decision,
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:26.100]   that kind of playfulness and it's like a pun in technology
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:30.180]   sort of being self-aware of what the technology is capable of,
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.540]   that in and of itself is a thing of beauty.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.140]   Beyond whatever the gameplay experience is,
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.020]   whoever thought of that, like, thumbs up, man.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.220]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a very good way to put it.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.860]   It's very playful.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.700]   - Yeah.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.180]   - Now you're still killing zombies, Patrick, I see.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.340]   - Yes, I am.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.300]   So the graphics are pretty good on this, actually.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.740]   It's a fairly good experience.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.500]   - This was a hard game to play on the iPhone
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.220]   because you know, the screen is so small,
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.820]   you don't have really room for controls,
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.420]   so you're kind of scurrying what you're doing
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.740]   with your big fat thumbs,
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.540]   but you could see there's so much room on the iPad
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.620]   that you really can use joysticks and thumb controls
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.460]   and they work quite well.
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.220]   - Yeah, and I've actually, as far as the gaming goes,
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.260]   it's a lot better than it is on the iPhone
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.340]   and I'm actually finding it very playable
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.620]   'cause I've actually tried to play this game on the iPhone too
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.620]   and it's a hard, say the least.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:20.700]   - Jason, what are you playing?
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.020]   You got any games on there?
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.660]   - Oh, you just cost me 10 bucks.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.100]   I bought plans versus zombies.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.660]   (laughing)
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.820]   So that's the end of my life.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.300]   - It is the end of your life.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.780]   - I have an embarrassing addiction to...
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.100]   - Bajule two blitz.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.340]   - I love Bajule two blitz.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.660]   - You told me how to play, actually.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.380]   You really helped my game.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.620]   - And so the, it's a totally embarrassing thing.
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.540]   It's like my two sister-in-laws
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.540]   and they're addicted to it.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.020]   So I basically am in every week in competition with them
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.900]   to see who can score more on Bajule two
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.900]   and they both beat me.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.020]   You know, it's just embarrassing.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.580]   And then everybody knows when you play it
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.340]   because you have to post your high score.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.460]   So now people are like, what are you doing?
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.420]   You have all this free time with your kid
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.820]   and all this stuff, you're playing Bajule every day.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.020]   And I'm like, well, that's when I'm in line for something.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.020]   You know, whatever.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.500]   But, you know, I just thought of something though,
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.460]   we were talking before about, you know,
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.020]   why is it not have all the features?
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.380]   Why can't you multitask and stuff like that?
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.820]   And I think the most awesome feature of this,
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.620]   or a surprise feature for me,
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.860]   is that the battery lasts forever.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:28.980]   - Oh, it's so great.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.220]   - How is that possible?
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:33.660]   I mean, my iPhone lasts under an hour.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.260]   - Well, Jason, I was thinking,
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.300]   I was arguing about this with somebody yesterday.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.980]   The fact that the device is not yet trying
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.380]   to connect to a cellular network,
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.380]   I would wager has something to do with that.
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.900]   - Oh, maybe, yeah.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.100]   - Yeah, but I mean, 12 hours of battery life,
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.660]   10 hours of battery life playing movies, playing games.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.220]   It's absurd.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:56.220]   I think this is why Steve is keeping all the other features
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.300]   out of the item.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.700]   I think he realizes battery life is paramount.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.380]   And I think he's made such a big deal about windows crashing
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.940]   and his marketing campaigns.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.500]   And he's got that sort of three decades of fighting
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.100]   Bill Gates and Microsoft, and that's like his one,
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.660]   you know, thing he can always take out like,
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.420]   oh, blue screen of death, blue screen of death.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.620]   He is paranoid about having a blue screen of death
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.220]   on his device.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.100]   So the only thing he allows to run the background
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.620]   is the phone or the iPod software,
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.420]   which is something he has direct control over.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.620]   He's desperate to not have it crash,
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.220]   or have the battery go down.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.580]   If you multitask the battery is gonna last half as long.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.940]   Somebody, I think it was the ultimate,
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.780]   or the unofficial Apple web blog pointed out
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.180]   that one of the reasons they may not have flash in here
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.780]   and they may not, they may have done their own chip
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.580]   is because when you do an ASIC, a custom ASIC like the A4,
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.060]   you can take capabilities out and you don't need,
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.860]   unlike a general purpose chip where you'd have support
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.300]   for things like flash or a camera where you'd have,
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.660]   you'd have capabilities built in
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.180]   to support these technologies.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.100]   You can save energy, you can save complexity,
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.380]   you can make a cheaper chip.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.180]   If you know, well, we're not gonna support a camera.
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.260]   We're not gonna support flash.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.780]   You don't have to support those things in the hardware either.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.780]   What are you showing there, Robert?
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.100]   - Oh, I'm showing you the new Netflix app.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.540]   - I love that, by the way.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.500]   I watched a movie last night.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.340]   - Yeah.
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.860]   - That's what made me realize this is a TV,
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:18.980]   or this is the competitor for this
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.700]   is maybe not your laptop, but your TV.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.140]   - Well, look at what we're doing here.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:28.060]   We can have personalized media experiences.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.260]   We can be watching a 60 inch movie.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.620]   We can then be on Twitter and talking with our friends
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.380]   and Patrick can be on Facebook or reading his forums
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.060]   and we don't have to have the same experience
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.220]   or we can play a game against each other.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.700]   - So much for family life, it's all over, folks.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.260]   It was bad enough with blackberries and iPhones.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.500]   Now we don't have to talk to each other
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.860]   or even look at each other at all ever again.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:53.260]   Are you gonna have a rural Robert Noi pads at the table?
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.420]   - Well, this is gonna stay in the family room.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:56.820]   - Yeah, that's probably a smart idea.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.060]   I could just see this under the table at my house,
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.700]   all the teenagers.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.340]   - Well, can you stop the iPhone from being used there?
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.100]   - No, I have to take it away from them.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.580]   That's sad.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.700]   How about Kindle?
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.460]   Is this a threat to Kindle as a book application?
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.980]   Let's talk about that in a second before we do.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.900]   I do wanna mention a Go To Meeting.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.220]   And you know, by the way,
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:19.700]   this is one of the hot apps on here
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.140]   is a Go To Meeting app.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:26.140]   The folks at Citrix released a free Go To Meeting player.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:32.540]   So, I mean, I love the idea that you're supposed to be at work.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.540]   You're supposed to be meeting with somebody.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.060]   And you just go out, you take it easy,
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.380]   you go out to the park
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.740]   and you launch the Go To Meeting player.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.980]   And now you can join a meeting
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.860]   and watch the meeting and participating in the meeting
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.420]   directly from your iPad.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.220]   Go To Meeting is a great program
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.500]   for people who have to meet in business.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.380]   If you've been making conference calls
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.340]   and you've been suffering through them,
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:01.260]   you've been suffering through the pain of being on the phone
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.740]   and knowing the other person's playing with their iPad
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.160]   or their iPhone, playing, you know,
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.060]   bejeweled blitz.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.100]   - Yeah.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.020]   - You know they're doing it
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.420]   'cause it gets quiet on the other end, right?
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.460]   - I know they're doing it 'cause I'm doing the same thing.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.300]   (laughing)
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.500]   - Well, Go To Meeting gives 'em something to look at,
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.860]   gives 'em your screen.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.620]   So, your PowerPoint, your demonstration, your training.
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.460]   Here's what you do.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.180]   You go to gotomeeting.com/tuit right now.

[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:49.620]   We use our Go To Meeting.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.620]   In fact, people will call up and say,
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.380]   "Oh, I wanna do SharePoint," or whatever it is,
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.140]   the Microsoft thing, or something.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.380]   No, sorry, we do Go To Meeting here.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.460]   I insist on it.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:02.260]   Mac or Windows, we couldn't do our shows without it.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.260]   We couldn't get as much done as we do without it.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.420]   And now that it's on the iPad,
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.020]   I don't have to come in anymore.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:10.740]   I'm gonna be doing my Go To Meetings here on the Park Bench.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.340]   Gotomeeting.com/tuit.

[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.420]   We thank the folks at Citrix for supporting the show,
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.300]   and I'm really thrilled that they did an iPad app for this.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.500]   That's fantastic.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.020]   - Hey, Leo, I just wanna say,
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:34.020]   I was just looking at CNN's coverage of the Quake just now.
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.300]   The last line of the report is,
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.020]   posters to Twitter reported feeling the Quake
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.020]   as far as Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.140]   - It's kind of amazing how CNN has embraced Twitter.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.580]   I mean, it's as if they discovered it,
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.340]   and they just embraced it.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.060]   It's everywhere they are now.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.660]   And it almost makes it feel pass-say
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.100]   that mainstream media has such a big, such a hold on it.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:00.580]   I have to say, Twitter is really nice on the iPad.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.420]   - Yeah, sure is.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:02.340]   - There are three good applications.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.180]   Twitterific immediately came out with a free one.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.980]   TweetDeck has a very nice one that basically
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.260]   duplicates the functionality of TweetDeck on the desktop.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:12.140]   But I have to say, I like Andrew Stone's version.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.620]   Andrew does does really, this is Twitter-later Pro,
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.380]   does really beautiful stuff.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.660]   And I think really uses the interface nicely.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.420]   So this is the timeline.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:24.860]   This square on the right can be direct messages.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.380]   See the border that lets you know.
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.740]   It can be mentions.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.060]   See the little envelope that lets you know.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.300]   You can watch trends there, trending topics
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.300]   so we can easily see the earthquake trending topic here.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.140]   There's also regional trends, which is something
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.500]   that Twitter does but doesn't necessarily expose
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:45.100]   in a lot of the Twitter applications.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:49.380]   And I really like this inline pictures.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.020]   So if you use TweetPhoto or TweetPick
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.700]   or one of the well-known pictures sites,
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.820]   it just puts it in line right in there.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.220]   And I just love that.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.060]   This is a very, anyway, there are a lot of different ones.
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.580]   This one's not free.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.100]   Twitterific is, and I think a lot of people
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.780]   will use Twitterific, although they have ads in Twitterific.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.460]   - I have Twitterific up on my iPad right now
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.380]   so people can see it.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:09.300]   - It's pretty.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.540]   To me, it feels like it's not using the space
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:13.420]   very efficiently.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.740]   Look how big that is.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.420]   But you do get big pictures of people, which is nice.
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.180]   It's nice for the pictures.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:23.540]   I do like to be able to see people.
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.380]   I have TweetDeck as well, which is really pretty good.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.020]   It has more information on the screen,
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.140]   more tweets on the screen.
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.020]   But I actually like the look of this.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.900]   And because my stream moves so fast,
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:36.140]   I just like to sit there in bed
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.500]   and just page through my stream.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.340]   - Right.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.180]   - Pretty nice.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.540]   - Have you tried Twitter later?
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.620]   - No, that looked really cool.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.460]   - So I'm free.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.300]   - I'm gonna try that next.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.220]   - So pretty.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.460]   I'm a sucker for pretty.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.700]   I love it that design is going to become
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.260]   so much more important thanks to this.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.500]   Apple already did that on the Macintosh.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.780]   And this just takes it to the next level.
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.860]   Why are you showing us that?
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.020]   (laughing)
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.140]   - This is my answer.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.420]   The Kindle is dead.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.740]   - Yeah, let's talk about book reading.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.100]   - Battery is empty.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.660]   - I have to say, and I mentioned this early,
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:11.020]   I'm thrilled that Amazon's Kindle application
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.820]   is not only on here, updated, and Apple hasn't stopped it.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.780]   So all of my Kindle books,
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.900]   everything I have in my library is available here.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.820]   And using Whipsprissink is always up to date.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.820]   And this is a really great experience.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:28.340]   - I love that the titles, the page covers are in color.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.140]   (laughing)
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:32.340]   - Well, in fact, I'm looking at a programming book,
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.780]   Steve Cochin's Objective-C book.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.940]   And apparently he did the screenshots in color
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.740]   'cause they're in color on the Kindle application,
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.580]   which is great.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:44.660]   The Winnie the Pooh that comes with the iBook application,
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.260]   of course has color illustrations too.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.660]   And it's actually a very good choice.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.060]   But what about reading?
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:53.420]   Is it as easy to read on here, do you think?
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.260]   - I think so.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:58.860]   You know, I read a little bit last night on here,
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.020]   and it was just as nice as the Kindle.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:05.260]   The one exception is that there's glare on this screen.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.100]   - Right.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.460]   - And also it doesn't work in bright sunlight.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.180]   - It's best in the dark, let's face it.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.340]   - And if you, so right, so I bought the Kindle
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.580]   'cause I live near the beach,
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.220]   and so I like to go out there,
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.340]   I just found I never used it for that.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.660]   (laughing)
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.940]   So that argument just doesn't wash with me
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.660]   because when I'm on the beach,
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:29.540]   I just, I never liked reading that much on the Kindle.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.780]   And here the page turns are so much faster,
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.500]   so I can read faster, I can skim faster.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.340]   The Kindle is really hard to skim through a book,
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.380]   which is a lot of how I read,
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.660]   this is why I like paper because you can,
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.380]   you know, in fact, who has a big book here?
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.980]   Oh, downstairs is Tom Peters' new book.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.700]   And it's the kind of book that you don't read
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.700]   from front to back, you sort of skim through it
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.860]   and look for an interesting idea.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.700]   - Right.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.220]   - And then you focus on that idea for a little while,
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.660]   and then you skim and find another one, you know?
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.780]   - I have to say, if it's got color illustrations
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.780]   like this one of the poo, it just,
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.780]   this just beats the Kindle all like crazy.
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.220]   - Yeah. - It's just gorgeous.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.740]   You know, it's funny is the Kindle app on the iPad
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.700]   doesn't have the dictionary that the Kindle has,
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.220]   but the iBook app does have the dictionary.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.900]   And I've always thought that was a nice feature
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:25.500]   of the Kindle is that you can look up a word
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.020]   if you're reading along and you don't know the word.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.380]   Of course, it's got the same capabilities
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.660]   and notating and bookmarking and all of that stuff.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.620]   - Well, not only that, but look at this book, Peter Rabbit.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.140]   This isn't even in the Kindle app.
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.860]   This is just an iPhone app that you download,
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.940]   but you click on it, it has color.
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.700]   It reads to you and I'm gonna leave that off,
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:49.340]   but as it reads to you, it fills in the picture, you know?
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:53.020]   And, you know, it's color, look at that.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.700]   And compared to the Kindle, my son never liked the Kindle.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.380]   You know, my two-year-old, he's not gonna be kept attentive
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.940]   to a black and white screen that doesn't move, you know?
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.020]   - My 75-year-old mom says she's gonna continue
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:07.740]   to use the Kindle 'cause it's lighter
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.780]   and it's easier on her eyes.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.420]   - Oh, talk about that.
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.660]   Yesterday was the first day my mother-in-law
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.820]   has really used a computer and she doesn't,
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.140]   she grew up in Iran, she doesn't speak English.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.580]   And I was able to pull up Farsi,
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.220]   the Farsi version of the BBC and hand it to her.
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.060]   - That's nice.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.100]   - And because of the form factor,
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.940]   it's more like looking at a book, right?
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.900]   So people like that who are adverse to computers
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.660]   feel a lot more comfortable.
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.980]   If you hand them a laptop with a lot of keys
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:41.540]   that they don't understand and can't read,
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:44.140]   they really freak out, but she took right to it.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.380]   She was paging through things and clicking.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.380]   She learned how to click on things
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.220]   and how to zoom on things really easily.
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:54.580]   And so it's bringing a new kind of person
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:55.860]   to the computer world.
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.420]   Remember, only about a seventh of the world's population
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.860]   is on computers, out of seven billion people, you know,
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.180]   probably around a billion and a half are on computers
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.700]   and probably around two billion are on cell phones.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:13.260]   So if this metaphor, if this style thing
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.860]   brings computing to more people,
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:16.100]   that'll help us all out.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.700]   - Would you read books?
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.500]   Do you use a Kindle Jason?
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:26.860]   - No, I listen to audio books on Audible Kindle.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.580]   You know, I just found my whole day of reading emails
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.460]   and other documents.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.020]   So at the end of the day, I'm really tired my eyes.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.220]   I just like to close them and listen to an audio book.
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.780]   I think most people sadly don't read that much.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.860]   So the, you know, for the majority of users,
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:45.860]   they would rather have a game playing device
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:48.420]   that can surf the web and then books
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.300]   as something they do 5% of the time or 10%.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:54.020]   And the serious readers, yeah, they might go for
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:57.700]   the Kindle over, you know, the iPad,
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.740]   but I think the iPad got it, right?
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.380]   Which is, you know, make the screen really good
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.700]   for surfing the web and looking at photos and videos
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.540]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:10.540]   And then maybe lose a little bit of traction
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.540]   when people are reading a book
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:12.460]   than the other way around.
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.020]   I mean, surfing the web on a Kindle is a joke, right?
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:18.460]   But if you turn, I find if you turn the brightness down
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.980]   on the iPad, it looks much better.
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:21.820]   - You can do that.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.180]   It's built into the book application.
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.260]   - Yeah, and the book application.
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.700]   If they've put it down to about, I don't know, a third,
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:27.740]   it's much more readable.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.620]   If you have it on the top, your eyes just are--
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.340]   - It's vibrating, but yeah, it sucks in the sun.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.900]   I mean, it's unreadable.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.020]   I mean, even the iPad in general, I mean,
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.540]   if you're in a room with too much light, it's not readable.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.380]   These glare screens are--
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.780]   - They're very glary, yeah.
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.260]   - Yeah, what is the point of it?
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.300]   Is the glare-ness, what makes it so crisp?
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.420]   - Yeah, blacks are richer because in order to reduce glare,
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:52.540]   you have to essentially almost fog up the screen.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.740]   And so you don't get the contrast ratios
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.860]   that you would get with the clear screen.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.340]   It's just a clear screen, it's a glass screen.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.780]   How about you, Jenny, are you a Kindle user?
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.500]   - I'm not, you know, I tried it out,
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.780]   but it never, it was never a device
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.780]   that I got all churchy about.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.940]   I like the iPad because it fits with my continuous
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.820]   partial attention deficit disorder lifestyle.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:17.820]   - Yes.
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:19.620]   - So I can change my mind very quickly
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:22.580]   between wanting to read a book and wanting to maybe work
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.860]   on a lightweight blog post for Boing Boing,
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:29.180]   play a game, you know, look around
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.340]   in the periodic table of elements.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.820]   You guys haven't shown that on screen, that's my favorite.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:32.980]   - I don't have it, would you show it?
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.700]   'Cause it's expensive, you got it from Apple.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.620]   I didn't get it, so I have to buy it.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.300]   - It's 14 bucks, let's see if you have it.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.820]   - Yeah, that's a lot for the periodic table
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:41.740]   of the elements for me.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.260]   - Oh, but it's not just any periodic table.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.700]   (laughing)
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.500]   - It's got pictures of copper, look at that.
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.900]   - I'm a shill for science, you guys, look at this.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.060]   - Oh, actually, that is pretty.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:51.900]   - It's a copper.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.740]   - Okay, all right.
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.380]   - And then look here, I'm going to open up
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.940]   the Wolfram Alpha.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.860]   - Okay, all right, I'm buying it.
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:00.020]   - You can see that there's like,
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:02.580]   you can look at the thermodynamic properties of copper.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.160]   (imitates
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.000]   "bababababababa")
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:06.840]   But here, let's go to the second page,
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.020]   and then you see all of the different representations,
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.820]   and you see how I'm like moving around
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.380]   that dragon with my finger,
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.180]   so you can manipulate the objects, and then--
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.180]   - Wow.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:19.780]   - Look at that, so now we're looking at
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.540]   what would be a 3D representation.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.380]   - Is that stereo?
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.580]   So if you had the glasses, the anamorphic glasses.
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.820]   - Yeah, you know what, I don't have them
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:26.860]   on my desk right here right now,
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.780]   but there's these, it's like for $4,
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:33.980]   you can buy these little boxy paper lenses
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.380]   that you look, they're not paper lenses.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.380]   Paper glasses with little plastic lenses.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.220]   - Plastic lenses, right.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.660]   - And you look at this application,
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.180]   and it's really amazing.
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.700]   You can twirl those little 3D images too,
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.220]   so it's like you really do have
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.080]   sort of a holographic experience.
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:55.140]   - By the way, Leo, I just, I loaded the Wolfram Alpha app
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.180]   up on my iPad, and I just typed in the word copper,
[00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.420]   and it does all sorts of fun stuff.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.340]   - Could you explain why they charge for that app
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.740]   when I can use the Safari and do,
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:06.540]   can I not do exactly the same thing in Safari?
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.980]   - Yeah.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.740]   - It's two bucks now, so it's not as expensive as--
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.020]   - So it's a donation to Steven.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:16.580]   - Yeah, you know, help developers stay alive
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.140]   and notice there's no ads on here,
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:23.140]   so he's not making a whole lot of money off of a $2 ad,
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.860]   or a $2 app so far.
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.900]   I think it just has a little bit nicer layout,
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.780]   but God knows.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:30.660]   - Hey, I bought the Wikipedia application.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.260]   Don't ask me why, I don't--
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.100]   (laughing)
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.540]   - Jimmy Wales needs to eat too, you know.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.860]   - I don't think he even has anything to do with it.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.940]   I don't think he wrote the Wikipedia application.
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.420]   (laughing)
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:45.220]   All right, so gaming, thumbs up, book reading,
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.660]   well, kinda Metz-a-Metsa.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.620]   (laughing)
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.540]   - Isn't that the traffic?
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.220]   Here's something for the 3G version,
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:55.580]   'cause we haven't seen the 3G version of the iPad yet.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.980]   Are we gonna see a new kind of traffic app
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.300]   come out for this?
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.100]   - You know, I'm surprised at how good the geolocation
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.140]   is even without GPS on this.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.900]   I guess they're using Skyhook,
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.700]   but the Maps application works quite well.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.500]   You're able to pinpoint yourself.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.140]   - Did you guys try Skywalk, or sorry, Starwalk?
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:12.980]   The Starwalk?
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.660]   - No, I'm gonna buy that too.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.060]   All right. - Well, it just so happens
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.180]   that I have it, let's see.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.340]   (laughing)
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.180]   - Here you go.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.020]   - So it knows where you are,
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.580]   and it shows you the sky as you're pointing at it?
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.940]   - Exactly, so there's the crab.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:26.780]   - That's really nice, that's pretty.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.300]   - And the canis major.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.620]   And there's trippy ambient music, can you hear it?
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.420]   - No.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.260]   - Turn it up.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.340]   - Oh, it's 'cause I gotta turn it up.
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.380]   - I can just picture like 50 people
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.460]   at Burning Man carrying that around the pliad next year.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.780]   - Oh yeah, this is dude.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.300]   - Dude, check out George.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.460]   - That's called, what is that called Starwalk?
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.300]   - Skywalk?
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.140]   - Starwalk.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:48.980]   - I guess it's--
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.180]   - I think it's 10 bucks.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:54.300]   I mean, it's pricey, but that and the elements
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.580]   are certainly my two favorites.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.580]   - All right, all right.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.260]   - It seems, what's Google gonna do?
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.420]   Because Google's coming, I know there's Google tablets
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.900]   coming with the Google Chrome OS,
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.540]   and the Google version of that app is already free on Android.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.780]   So I bet, you know, the Google's gonna come in
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.180]   with a really nice map on their app,
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.020]   and a whole bunch of new kinds of apps on theirs.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.780]   It'll be really interesting to see how Google
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.420]   and Apple compete over this new space
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:25.220]   that Apple is really proving exists.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.940]   - Yeah, somebody just corrected me on the price too.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.340]   I think it's actually at least--
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.180]   - It's 4.99.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.020]   - 4.99, thanks.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.180]   - Yeah, I just bought it, that's how I know.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.300]   (laughing)
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.620]   I'm a sucker.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.180]   - The answer to your question, Robert,
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:41.180]   is that the Android tablets are going to sell
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:44.460]   probably two or three to one to iPads.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.500]   - Really, you think so?
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.700]   - Absolutely, 'cause there'll be probably 30% less,
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:53.300]   and there'll be, I would say there'll be 50 different
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.100]   versions of it out in the year, just like there are.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.740]   And if you look at like the HTC phones,
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.180]   and how quickly they're iterating,
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.260]   and the features they're putting in them,
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.180]   and the stability of the Android operating system,
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:08.300]   Android, it's very clear Android's gonna outpace
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.940]   the number of iPhones.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.620]   And with the iPad, I think it'll be an even bigger difference,
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.460]   because when you think about it,
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.660]   this is gonna be a $600, $700 device,
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.220]   if you wanna have the version with the internet on it,
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.500]   and when it comes out on Android,
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.980]   gosh, I would be surprised if it's over 500.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:27.820]   You'll probably have three or $400 purchases,
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:30.060]   and when these things get down to 300,
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.100]   everybody's gonna have one,
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.380]   just like a lot of kids have the iPod touch in a family.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.020]   You'll have three of these in your house,
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.340]   but when they're $600, $700,
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:38.980]   you're not gonna have three of them in your house,
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.980]   and price is gonna really matter.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.580]   - And to try it. - Well, go ahead.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.540]   - I'm less interested in the 3G.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.820]   I'm really pissed that they didn't put GPS
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.020]   in the cheaper device,
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.020]   because for my car,
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.220]   my kids are gonna be sitting in the backseat
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.860]   with two of these, or three of these,
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:56.300]   and Patrick's a lot.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.460]   And I'm gonna put by a Sprint 4G modem
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.540]   that's coming out in San Francisco for the car.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.420]   It costs about $100 or $200
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.780]   to 10 tech head one at South by Southwest,
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.700]   and it's really fast.
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.540]   It's like DSL speeds.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.300]   And then you spray Wi-Fi into the car,
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.900]   so if you have three devices in the car,
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.380]   they all use the same connection,
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.580]   and I only pay for the connection one time,
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.300]   instead of having to buy 3G for each different iPad,
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.900]   or Google Chrome OS pad that comes out.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.700]   - This is the future.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.860]   Yeah, I have one.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.300]   And in Austin, the Sprint Overdrive
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.340]   actually was connecting over 4G,
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.660]   and it was legitimate DSL speeds,
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.780]   and Los Angeles was getting 4G next
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.620]   from what I understand,
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.340]   and Sprint is on a jihad to get,
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.180]   'cause Sprint's as a company is really screwed up right now.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.020]   So they're basically saying,
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.420]   "Let's bet the whole farm on 4G,
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.700]   "so it's gonna be great for consumers."
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.860]   And I think the future is people are gonna have this,
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:57.900]   and phones without cellular service on them.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:58.740]   So you'll get one of these--
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:59.580]   - What is this?
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.420]   Tell us what that thing is.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:01.740]   I can see it for this.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:02.980]   - It's a Wi-Fi router,
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.500]   and it's really cool about it,
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.620]   it has all the lights. - It's called the Overdrive.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.580]   - Overdrive, and what's cool about it is,
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.380]   it creates a little Wi-Fi network.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.540]   It connects over 3G or 4G,
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.100]   and you can connect a bunch of devices to it,
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.020]   and it's got this very cool LED display here
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.740]   that shows you how many people are connected to it,
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.580]   how much you've sent, or signal strength.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.340]   And I'm finding myself carrying this with me,
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.420]   and for example, I was playing poker the other night
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.740]   till six or seven in the morning,
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.380]   and I was at the casino,
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.300]   and I just popped this out,
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.820]   and had my blackberry and my iPhone running off this,
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.460]   'cause it was a better connection.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:35.300]   And faster.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.900]   So using the iPhone on AT&T really sucks.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.140]   Obviously we all know that.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.620]   So basically what you do is you go into these,
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.420]   and now your iPhone is on sprint,
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.580]   and this lasts two hours,
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.020]   and this is the first generation device.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.220]   They're a little bit screwy, they freeze up sometimes,
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.780]   and I had it rebooting problems,
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.060]   I sent it in, I got another one,
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:54.380]   this one's a little bit better.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.060]   So it is first gen, is a sort of disclaimer,
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.780]   but I've gotten two hours of life out of this
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.860]   using heavy internet.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.140]   So I think that, and it's crazy,
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.700]   but they have a new innovation that I guess Steve Jobs
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.100]   hasn't figured out yet,
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.660]   but if you go on the back here,
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.860]   you can open it up and take the battery out.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.300]   It's a very advanced technology.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.860]   Removable battery, so.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:15.940]   (laughs)
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.420]   I think Steve's working his R&D department's hard at work
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:19.940]   on the removable battery concept.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:22.740]   - Well they can't figure out how to get the removable battery
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.420]   and the solid aluminum back.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.580]   (laughs)
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.060]   - They could figure it out if they wanted to.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:29.260]   It's so, this is the thing that's so frustrating.
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.100]   I mean, you really,
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.900]   I'm an adult and I can't change the battery on my iPhone.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.820]   This is when the arguments of like,
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.420]   oh, it's beautiful, has to be designed,
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.260]   well, it has to be used.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.540]   - You know, I'm changing batteries,
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.020]   people have been doing for 50 years.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.740]   - Yeah, but you said one thing that you like about this
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:43.740]   is the long battery life.
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.620]   One of the reasons you can get more battery life
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.100]   is because you can put more battery in,
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.580]   because you don't have to put an enclosure
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.420]   around the battery.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.620]   So you get more capacity.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.380]   - Now that the worst thing I did,
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.220]   when I picked this up was just feel the edges.
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.140]   There's no.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.060]   - I don't think it's aesthetic.
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:01.060]   I think it's, well, it's partly aesthetic.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:01.900]   - But I think- - Come on,
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.300]   you know Steve Jobs, you know what it is.
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.100]   - It's partly aesthetic, but it's also,
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.620]   it really is a way to get maximum battery life
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.460]   out of the thing.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.700]   - He doesn't want to put a freaking door on this thing,
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.300]   or a little cliff or anything.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.660]   He wants it to be smooth all the way around.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.580]   And that sure is nice when you're holding this thing.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.340]   - No, you're being ridiculous, Robert.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.180]   - I'm not even ridiculous.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.020]   - This is the- - This is the-
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.740]   - This is Steve Jobs' OCD speaking.
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.300]   - The bad, most real, it's sex, man.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.460]   You know, you look at battery doors on these things
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.980]   and they add complexity to the devices.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.380]   They add buttons on the edge.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.940]   - Changing the battery's complexity?
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.860]   Are you out of your mind?
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.220]   Like, do you want a flashlight?
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.580]   - Okay, okay, okay.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.700]   - I know that Shenny has to leave.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.940]   - Is there LED and they last for 50 hours?
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:49.100]   - Boys, Mrs. Jardin has to move on.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.980]   And I really thank you for being here, Shenny.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.580]   It's really nice to meet you finally.
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.300]   After all these years, I've been a fan
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.740]   and of course, Boing Boing is absolutely
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.820]   the must read blog.
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:00.700]   And you do such a great job with it.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.300]   Also, jenny.net, X-E-N-I-D-N-E-T.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.020]   Another place to go.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.060]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:11.100]   Uh-oh, I think you've muted yourself again.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.740]   - You did it yourself, it would be you.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.740]   (laughing)
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.220]   - I'm sure she was saying nice things.
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.060]   I, uh.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.060]   (laughing)
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.940]   - Can you hear me now?
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:20.140]   - I can hear you now, thank you, Jenny.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.860]   - If you have me back, I'll make sure
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.180]   to bring another earthquake with me.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.020]   - Would you please?
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.020]   That was exciting.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:25.860]   - I will.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.700]   - That was the most real world thing
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.620]   we've had happen on this show ever.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.060]   And I'll just leave you with one thing.
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.660]   So I was just looking on Twitter and an astronomer
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:36.780]   that I follow said that the type of waves,
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.580]   the long rolling waves from the distant earthquake
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.020]   are known as love waves.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.340]   - Aw.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:44.180]   - Seriously.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.180]   - Aw, you just named the show.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.180]   - Don't google it.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.180]   (laughing)
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.180]   - I bet you're the geologist named love,
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.220]   but okay, we'll take it.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.060]   - Bye everyone.
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:52.900]   - Thank you, Jenny.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.740]   Great to talk to you.
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.460]   Boing Boing.net and, uh, Jenny.net.
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:59.340]   And boy, she's really very talented and well-known.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.940]   But you, I didn't realize you had worked with her before,
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:01.780]   Jason, that's cool.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.980]   - I met Jenny back when I was doing Silicon Island reporter
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:08.300]   in the 90s, and she was working for one of the clients
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.580]   of the magazine, and she helped me at one of the events
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.540]   we were doing here in Los Angeles,
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.260]   and she was like, oh, I'll moderate a panel.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.300]   She did an amazing job, and I went to the people
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.180]   she was working for, and I said, listen,
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.380]   it's been great having you as a client,
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.620]   but I have some bad news, and they said,
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.460]   what?
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.380]   I said, I'm gonna hire Jenny.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.460]   And they were like, oh my God, how could you do that?
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.820]   I'm like, no, no, it was a whole controversy.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:30.820]   I said, I'll give you a free sponsorship to the next event.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:31.820]   And they were like, okay.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:37.060]   You know, uh, so I basically gave a $20,000 sponsorship
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.660]   together to work for us, and she did an amazing job.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.500]   She's awesome.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.340]   - Yeah, she's awesome.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.260]   - One of my 10 favorite bloggers.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:45.100]   It's interesting, like there's a whole group of people
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.940]   who worked at Silicon Island reporter,
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:50.060]   Rafael Lee from Pay Content, Shani Jardin,
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.220]   and actually I was the first person to publish Clay Shurky.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.060]   - Really?
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:54.900]   - And we're a Silicon Island reporter, yeah.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.740]   - Oh, I love him too.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.340]   Boy, is he amazing?
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:58.900]   - I used to edit his pieces, and I'd be like,
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:00.900]   you have 800 words, he'd write 800 words,
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.260]   I would get through two paragraphs and say,
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.900]   I'm already lost.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.620]   And I'd say, dude, we'll have to explain these references,
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.660]   because I don't think people know this 14th century poet,
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.460]   nor do they know this philosopher.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.420]   So when you reference the two of them, and you say,
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.500]   like, you know, real gay is to this as, you know,
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.580]   Windows 95 is to, you know, Netscape 1.0.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:22.100]   I don't think people understand.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:22.940]   He's like, really?
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.980]   I was like, no, no, they don't,
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.260]   'cause I'm the average person,
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:29.740]   and I don't, I slept through that,
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:31.260]   that cool, syncology.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.540]   I didn't go to graduate school, it was pretty funny.
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:34.580]   - And what are you playing, Robert?
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.420]   What is that?
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.340]   That looks really interesting.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.660]   - Patrick's playing Geometry Wars, yeah.
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.300]   - Wow, that looks really cool.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:41.140]   - That looks really cool.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.860]   - This is looking to cost me like 50 or 80 months.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.500]   - Oh, I have spent so much money on apps,
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.260]   and you know, I don't feel like we're seeing anywhere.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.020]   It's interesting, I think in some ways,
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:52.380]   this is television in the Milton-Burly era, you know?
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:55.540]   This is a first generation device,
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.620]   and just imagine, I mean, look at what we're seeing already,
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.540]   and just imagine what we're gonna see in a year
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.020]   as people start to understand how to develop for it.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.740]   Apple did a brilliant thing by making it
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:07.260]   the same operating system as the iPhone.
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:09.140]   So you've got this great base of applications,
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.980]   and a lot of developers who, more importantly,
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.260]   I think, who know how to write for it.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.780]   And we're already seeing amazing stuff,
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.020]   and I think this is just the beginning.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:19.540]   This is, if I were a young guy learning a program,
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.420]   I'd be learning Objective-C, Coco, and--
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.060]   - You know what the problem is, though, Leo,
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:31.060]   is if Steve Jobs was less obsessive about control,
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.420]   - I understand, yeah.
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:37.060]   - And he let those apps run on Android and BlackBerry.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.180]   Do you realize how big Apple would get?
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.660]   - No, I agree, I think it's a mistake.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.500]   - Huge!
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.540]   And I think what you said about an Android tablet,
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.100]   selling three times more than the iPad is very interesting,
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.740]   and you're probably right, not just for price,
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.300]   but I think, you know me, I switched from an iPhone
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.260]   to a Nexus One, I like Android.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:12:00.700]   I understand that multitasking, as much as people like it,
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.820]   does make it harder to write software,
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.380]   harder to maintain an operating system reliably,
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.060]   it adds to complexity, and in a way,
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:11.140]   if you have something that says snappy as the iPad is,
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:13.700]   you can kind of live without multitasking.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.340]   - Well, what would be great is a feature
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:18.180]   in the settings panel that said,
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.220]   I want to turn on the advanced feature set,
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.340]   or I want to turn on the developer feature set,
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:24.220]   and Steve Jobs could do that in 15 minutes,
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.700]   as a matter of fact, it must have that internally,
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.180]   like turn on developer thing.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.020]   So we just won't--
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.540]   - No, he's a drill freak.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.620]   - And it's just absurd.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.500]   I mean, if you look at the phones,
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.260]   this is the embarrassing thing I think for Steve,
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:40.260]   is that in the first six months of the Android phones
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.420]   being out, they had better hardware profiles
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.220]   than anything he's built to date,
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:47.660]   and people think he's invincible and untouchable,
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.700]   and it's not true.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.860]   A lot of his innovations,
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.180]   you look what Microsoft Windows did to,
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.300]   the first version of the Macsoft,
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.180]   remember Microsoft originally had DOS,
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:00.060]   it didn't have a graphical user interface,
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:03.380]   and Windows came along and beat them 96 to four.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:08.420]   - I remember talking to Steve when he was still at Pixar,
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:13.420]   so it was probably '93, '94, and he said,
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.660]   and I thought it was very telling,
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:17.820]   we had a 10-year lead on Microsoft
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.700]   when we came out with the Macintosh in 1984,
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:23.220]   we had a 10-year lead, we let it slip,
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:26.660]   and 10 years later, with Windows 3.1 and later Windows 95,
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:29.580]   Microsoft caught up and we, an Apple,
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.380]   lost, and that was at the time, it was very astute,
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:35.340]   and I think he knows better than anybody,
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:38.220]   that there is no such thing as a permanent lead
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.820]   in this industry, it moves way too fast.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.020]   - It's an interesting game,
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:47.020]   that he's trading features, advanced technology,
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:52.100]   and the high tech crowd for ease of use,
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.860]   and a lack of crashing,
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.260]   and I think that it doesn't have to be binary,
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:59.980]   he could very easily make the concept of jailbreaking,
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:04.420]   legal, and just call it experimental,
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.020]   but he is so obsessive, I think,
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.620]   that he cannot handle the idea
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:10.780]   that somebody would put that on experimental mode,
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.620]   and they would be at a dinner and say,
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:13.900]   "Oh, my iPhone crashed."
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:14.740]   - Right.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.060]   - He takes it as a personal insult,
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.980]   that if his thing crashes,
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.020]   and that's the whole reason for the App Store as well.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:21.860]   - Right.
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:22.700]   - You know, and--
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.540]   - Complete control, yeah.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:26.260]   - Yeah, and it extends into three specific things,
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:30.940]   I think, one is he wants these devices to not crash,
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.740]   two, he doesn't want anybody to be confused,
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.900]   and feel intimidated by them,
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.220]   and then three, he doesn't want children
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.620]   to have a bad experience and have parents go,
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:40.980]   "This is inappropriate for kids."
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:41.820]   - Right.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:42.860]   - And if you look at Google,
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.700]   like Google is inappropriate for kids,
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.460]   if you type in any woman's name,
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.220]   and turn off safe search, and look at images,
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:51.940]   it's you're gonna be really, you know, offended,
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.780]   and/or delighted.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.780]   - Well, I gotta say, there's already one porn website
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.340]   that has created an iPad-specific version,
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.220]   I'm not gonna say the name,
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:03.140]   but I had to test it out, so I did just went and visited it.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.620]   - Can you say the name in the chat room?
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.900]   It's about 5%--
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.780]   - And it's iPad-specific,
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   but they've done as they've taken all the Flash videos,
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.140]   and they've made 'em H.264, 720p,
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.420]   so that they'll play back on an iPad.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.140]   What is that you're showing us there?
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.460]   - I did a search for porn,
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:21.140]   and found these two apps, PornStar Names.
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.740]   - Yeah, this is not an app, this is just,
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.300]   and this is the point, is that you do have a browser in here.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.780]   And if you, and you can--
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:30.100]   - These are actually apps, you know, but--
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.740]   - Yeah, but PornStar Names is just names.
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.900]   - You do a search for porn.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.020]   - Yeah, but go search for porn on an Android,
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.380]   there's plenty of it.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.220]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.940]   - It's very awful.
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:41.300]   - Well, it'll be also interesting to see
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:44.060]   what the adult entertainment industry does
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.940]   about Flash and Silverlight,
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:49.380]   and I bet they go HTML5 very quickly,
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:50.700]   because of these--
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:51.780]   - Well, that's what this website did,
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.100]   and you know it took 'em no time at all,
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.780]   they just made 720p, H.264 videos,
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:59.800]   and said this is an iPad version of our site, and done.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.300]   I wasn't able to get any of the videos to play, though.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:06.540]   (laughing)
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.020]   Which relieved me, because it was actually scary.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:13.180]   Lisa Tikal Pink has disappeared off the internet.
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.300]   Lisa Dear, if you're watching, I wore a pink shirt
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.980]   just for you, we would like to get you on
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.740]   to talk about the fact that you are now
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:22.300]   in the 30,000 follower club on Twitter,
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:26.100]   which is more than Dave Weiner, who invented RSS,
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.740]   so you're doing okay, kid.
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.940]   And we also would like to,
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.700]   if somebody could provide us with an alternative service
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.620]   to Twitrand, we'd like to give away an iPad
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.340]   before the show's over.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.620]   So we'll do that when we come back, I hope,
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:43.220]   before we do, though, get ready, get your size,
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.100]   and whispers ready, Jason Callan Canis,
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.100]   'cause it's time to talk about Haudible.com.
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.580]   - This website is good.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.740]   You're typing audible.com/twit.
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:57.980]   Twit, what is the--
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:01.260]   - Haudibles.com/twit-to, because you get one, not one,
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:02.860]   but two books, three.
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.180]   - Two books is better than one, though.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:07.220]   - And you don't have to hurt your eyes,
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.420]   close your eyes.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.820]   You have shades, you put shades on,
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.900]   and you relax and listen.
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.460]   - I thought that was funny when you said that, Jason,
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.900]   'cause it's, in fact, true that when I read books,
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.460]   I fall asleep almost instantly,
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.900]   'cause I'm reading in Ben Niggle.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.420]   And but audible, I listen to books while I'm driving,
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:24.620]   while I'm gardening, while I'm in the gym.
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:26.180]   These are times I'm not gonna fall asleep.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.700]   I get hours of reading done every single day,
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:29.900]   thanks to audible.
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:34.300]   - And there's now, there's like facts and news,
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:35.820]   and then there's wisdom.
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.140]   And I think what a lot of young people don't do today
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.140]   is they're so hyped up on getting quick news, tweets,
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:45.980]   Facebook updates, news stories, blog posts.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:48.740]   That's all great, but you don't get deep wisdom from that,
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.540]   'cause you don't get so deep into a subject
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.620]   that you actually understand it on a very deep level,
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:55.380]   and it can apply that.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.820]   And when you listen to business audio books,
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:00.420]   or science audio books, or psychology,
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.620]   or self-improvement, and you spend five, 10 hours
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:07.580]   with the subject, you really have learned something deeply.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:12.580]   And that's what's missing from most people's media diet.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:15.580]   They don't have substance and wisdom,
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:16.940]   and that's what I get out of waterable,
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.420]   because that's what I'm craving,
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.500]   and that's what I apply to business.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:24.100]   I have quoted this book that I've been listening to,
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.540]   and I'm two thirds away through it,
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:28.900]   Talent is overrated to my people,
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:32.100]   and to CEOs of other companies I'm an angel investor in,
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.940]   and this book is awesome, but I wouldn't have read it,
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.420]   because I'm just too tired to read
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.980]   a three, four, five hundred page book at the end of the day.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.060]   But I can plow through this when I'm driving,
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.820]   when I'm on a Southwest flight to the valley.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.460]   I mean, audible makes my life very easy.
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:47.940]   I'm on the two book plan,
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.420]   and that means I'm always like four books ahead,
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.140]   and that's the perfect ratio for me,
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.700]   because I've got, I'm probably about three or four books
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:57.100]   behind, which means if I wanna switch,
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.980]   I've always got them there, it's no pressure,
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:00.900]   and it's only like, what is it, 12 bucks a month,
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.820]   or something silly?
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:02.940]   - Yeah, it's not very expensive.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.780]   It's definitely the way they go.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:04.780]   - Super cheap. - Yeah.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:08.540]   - And the points that you get, each of these books,
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.940]   it's cumulative, so like let's say you take
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.420]   two months off from it, and you're like,
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.580]   oh my God, I wasted it, you have your Netflix account,
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.420]   you don't use it for three months,
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:16.420]   and you're like, oh my God, I wasted it,
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.900]   that happens to me all the time, not with Audible.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.780]   Those credits build up.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.220]   So then, let's say, you win there,
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.620]   you have five or six credits, like I did the other day.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:27.420]   I had five or six credits, I went right to the,
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.060]   they have like an Oscars of book awards.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.820]   I looked at the top two or three business books,
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:32.060]   the top two or three science books, they said,
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.220]   you know what, I'm taking them all.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.580]   I'll put them on my phone if I listen to it,
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.140]   I listen to it, but for 150 bucks a year,
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.780]   200 bucks a year, what is that the cost of, you know?
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:45.020]   I mean, it's a cost of a couple of iPad applications,
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.900]   14 iPad applications, you're gonna get really smart.
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.260]   - I was doing a search for Clay Shirkie,
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:52.060]   but I didn't Clay Shark instead, let me let, I mean yeah.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.180]   I don't think any of his books are on here, too bad,
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:56.380]   'cause that would be really something to listen to.
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.180]   - And maybe with him actually--
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.140]   - Readin' him.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.780]   - Readin' him would be great.
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:03.900]   There's so much great stuff, look, you get two choices.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.100]   So pick your two free books by going to audible.com/twit2,
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:09.140]   you're gonna sign up for the platinum account.
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:12.060]   First two books are free, you can cancel anytime.
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:14.740]   I know you won't want to, 'cause you're just gonna love it.
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.660]   How about this one, I just, I haven't read this,
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.220]   but I just love the name, the Hugo,
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:22.100]   rise and fall of the worst car in history.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.580]   See, to me, that's the kind of book I wanna read.
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:26.740]   - You're gonna learn something.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:27.580]   - You're gonna learn something.
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.180]   - It's got history, there's gotta be a ton of lessons in there.
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:33.980]   Audible.com/twit2, browse around, find your two books,
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.860]   take 'em, you're gonna love 'em.
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.180]   Jason and I guarantee it.
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:41.460]   Hey, look who's in the Skype window down here.
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.460]   She's all dressed in pink.
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:46.740]   It's Lisa tickled pink, how are you, Lisa, Etheridge?
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.980]   - Hi, Leo, I'm good, I'm so pleased
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.060]   you're wearing pink today.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.500]   - I wore it just for you, dear.
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.420]   They tell me though, it's Rose, is that okay?
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.820]   Will that work?
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:58.180]   - I would've said salmon, but it works for me, thank you.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.060]   - Salmon, okay, salmon.
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.660]   Is everything you do pink?
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:06.620]   - No, I do lime-brin, too, food and blue,
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.860]   but mostly pink, yeah.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.660]   It's my phone, no, I see that.
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.700]   - It's pink, her iPhone.
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.820]   So, let me think, now this was three weeks,
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.540]   four weeks ago, that Kevin Rose just randomly picked you
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.980]   because you just joined Twitter
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:24.980]   and your first tweet was, "I hate technology."
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:28.340]   - Yes, and I think it was the 28th of February
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:31.380]   and seems like a lifetime co now.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:33.620]   - And now your most recent tweet,
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.020]   "I'm not leaving, how could I?
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.780]   "I am a technology lover!"
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:39.460]   (laughs)
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:40.300]   - I love it.
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.140]   - Yeah, I know you're gonna read that out,
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:42.220]   I might not have to.
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.260]   (laughs)
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.260]   - So, what happened when we, when we,
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.260]   and I, first of all, and I have already apologized
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:52.020]   to you on Radio Whammo on Kiwi FM, I said, I'm so sorry
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.820]   that we just, we didn't warn you,
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:54.860]   we didn't tell you ahead of time,
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:56.260]   we just picked you out at random,
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.100]   and the next morning you wake up
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.820]   and there's thousands of emails and people are saying,
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.620]   following you and you had no idea what happened,
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:07.380]   was it, what was that like?
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.500]   - It was crazy.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:13.300]   I literally had, I go 2,000, 3,000 emails
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.860]   and my server just said, "We can't deliver anymore."
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:19.180]   So, I didn't know what was going on,
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.700]   someone emailed me eventually and said,
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:22.700]   "Look, and put the link onto your show."
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:26.260]   And, you know, so now I'm watching your show, so.
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:27.100]   - Thank you.
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.540]   - I've come a long way.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:29.380]   - Thank you.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.220]   - Thank you.
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.260]   - So, tell us a little bit about you.
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:34.780]   You're a uni student, a student at the University
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.260]   in Auckland, right?
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:39.780]   - Yep, uni tech in Auckland here,
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:42.900]   I'm doing a Bachelor of Product and Finisher Design,
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:46.220]   second year, another year full time to go,
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:51.020]   on what they call a mature student, obviously.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:54.220]   - Well, not so obviously, what, 25, what, I mean, that's nice.
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.420]   - Yeah, something like that, yeah.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.260]   - Something like that.
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.740]   - So, you're a returning student?
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:00.660]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:02.980]   - And furniture design, what an interesting,
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.820]   I think that sounds great.
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:07.860]   - Yeah, well, I love furniture, but in actual fact,
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:09.900]   now that I'm doing a bit of product, I love that too.
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.780]   So, might just see what happens after the end of,
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.780]   you know, my final year.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:16.900]   It's lots of fun and uni tech's great
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:19.220]   and it's all their fault when I was on Twitter, so.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:20.740]   - Isn't that wonderful?
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.980]   - Yeah, it's been great to see the social experiment,
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.100]   you know, from my school.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.220]   - Do you know what this is, Lisa?
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.060]   - Oh.
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:27.900]   - You know what that is, that is.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.060]   - This is a brown box.
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.260]   - That's a brown box, inside that brown box,
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:35.860]   unopened is a iPad 16 gigabyte iPad.
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.660]   Now, I'm gonna give you the choice,
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.380]   I could put some applications on here,
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.780]   or I could send you a, I think I have to put them on here,
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:44.460]   'cause I bet you you can't get them in the States.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.820]   So, why don't I load this up with some applications for you?
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.180]   'Cause you won't be in New Zealand,
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:50.900]   they won't have any of the stores.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:51.980]   - No, that sounds awesome.
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:52.820]   - Okay.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:53.660]   - You go for it.
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:54.580]   - You know what you need, you need Omni-graffle.
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.300]   If you're a designer, you need Omni-graffle,
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.380]   so I'll definitely put that on there,
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.620]   and I'll put to Auto-Sketch,
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.180]   which is Auto-CAD's sketching program,
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.820]   we'll put that on there, put a couple of hard buttons.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:02.820]   - Oh, sit on there.
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.860]   - Yeah, well, we'll load it up, we haven't opened it up,
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.460]   but we'll load it up before we set it out.
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:09.020]   We'll send this out, first thing in the morning,
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:09.860]   via FedEx.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.460]   - Oh, I'm excited.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:14.340]   - You'll be the first person in New Zealand
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:16.540]   to have a iPad.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.460]   - I'm going back to Radio Wemo.
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.460]   - Are you?
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.100]   - Yeah, I'm one. - With your iPad?
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.180]   - Yes, indeed.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:25.900]   And I just, I can't wait to find out who wins the draw,
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:28.860]   because I hope they stay, and I can follow them,
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.540]   because I need their help.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:35.620]   - You've got more than 31,000 followers right now.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:40.620]   Easily beaten Conan O'Brien's lonely, lovely toad stool,
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.940]   or whatever it is.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.740]   So you're the winner on that one.
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.780]   Let's see here. - Yeah, we showed him.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.980]   - We showed him, ha.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.860]   So let's see here, I have on my iPad,
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.180]   I'm gonna try another one.
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:56.940]   This is tweet randomizer.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.420]   Let's, this is to pick your follower of the day.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.220]   We put in your Twitter, Nick,
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.700]   and we press the button, and it says,
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:03.860]   "I think this is gonna work.
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.060]   "Find a random follower.
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.420]   "Are you ready, Lisa?"
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.580]   - Oh, this is so exciting.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.340]   - All right, out of your 31 followers,
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.340]   let's see who's gonna win that iPad.
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:16.340]   Your follower of the day is...
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:19.660]   - @Jason.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:20.860]   - @Jason, no.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:21.700]   - No, no, no.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.820]   - Is Floyd Norman wacky cartoonist.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:30.900]   There he is, he says, "We've entered the age of iPad.
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.540]   "He is your follower of the day,
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.780]   "and he wins himself an iPad.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:36.620]   "And I wanna see some cartoons, Floyd."
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:39.620]   So there's our winner, we're gonna tweet him at Floyd Norman.
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:40.980]   He's got 98 followers.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:44.100]   He's like you, Lisa, he's, I think, new to Twitter.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:45.940]   - Oh, congratulations to him.
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:46.900]   He'll be thrilled.
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.780]   - Wait a minute, they're all saying that's not random?
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.060]   Why is that not random?
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.460]   - Oh, you can't please 3,000 people.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.420]   That's one thing I have learnt on Twitter.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.620]   - I certainly hope that's random.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.620]   If it's not random, it's random enough.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.540]   (laughs)
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.180]   I don't know him, do you know him?
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:04.100]   - I don't know the guy, no.
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.340]   - I think that that's a random follower.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:09.820]   So that's, we're gonna say congratulations
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:11.860]   to Floyd Norman and all the people in there
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:14.780]   who say it's not random, well, I guess it's 'cause it wasn't you.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.540]   But we'll probably do this again.
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.540]   Lisa, congratulations, we're gonna send you out
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:22.460]   your very own iPad.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.380]   - I can't wait, Leo, thank you.
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:25.460]   It's been lots of fun.
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.940]   So I just wanna thank all your army for their support.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:29.060]   So it don't be amazing.
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:29.900]   - Thank you, Lisa.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.500]   It's been really great meeting you.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:32.540]   - Okay, it's true.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:36.220]   - And what, and it's 50 degrees in Auckland, New Zealand,
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:37.540]   right now, is that right?
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:38.900]   - Oh, God, this doesn't happen right now.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.740]   - I could tell you the weather in Auckland, New Zealand,
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.060]   I happen to have the weather on here,
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:44.500]   and you're gonna wanna put this on your iPad
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:45.460]   when it arrives, at least.
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:46.420]   I know it's bedtime for you.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.180]   I'm not gonna keep you up any later 'cause it, yeah.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:49.500]   - It's not, it's just--
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.820]   - It's the morning.
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:51.860]   - Into 12 here.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:52.700]   - That's what I thought.
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:53.620]   Everybody was saying she's in bed.
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.300]   I said, well, I don't think so.
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:56.420]   Let's just check.
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.540]   Let's just check the weather.
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.260]   And the weather in Auckland, New Zealand,
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:01.940]   oh, look at it, it's beautiful there.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:05.140]   It's clear 66 degrees, it's gonna be 71 degrees today.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:07.300]   Beautiful, beautiful weather in Auckland news.
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:08.820]   That doesn't look like Auckland, New Zealand.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:09.660]   - No, it doesn't.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:10.500]   It's like Honolulu, New Zealand.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.820]   - Looks like, oh, Lulu.
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.460]   But it looks like a beautiful day there.
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:14.860]   So I hope you're enjoying your day.
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:15.860]   Thank you, Lisa, Etheridge.
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:16.740]   Congratulations. - Okay.
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.300]   - Thanks for playing along with us.
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.980]   And I think you're gonna have to come visit us.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:21.060]   We'll work that out.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.060]   - I would love to.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:23.060]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:23.860]   - I'd love to anytime.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.100]   Thanks, Lulu. - Thanks, Lisa.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.340]   Lisa Etheridge, our winner.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.140]   - And congratulations.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.540]   I close this out.
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:34.500]   - To Floyd, now that, I don't know why.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:35.700]   Everybody will get that result now
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:38.180]   because that's her official follower of the day.
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:41.820]   It gets the same result every time
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:43.300]   because that's her follower of the day.
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.740]   It does it once a day.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.700]   I'm gonna go with it.
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.460]   Unless anybody could tell me there's no reason to go with that.
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.140]   The other one was broken, Jason.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.420]   - I love that Melissa Etheridge.
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.740]   - Is she adorable?
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.340]   - Come to my window.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.380]   I mean, what's the chance
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:59.380]   that you pick somebody who's an internationally known
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:00.460]   Grammy-winning--
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.820]   - Not Melissa, Lisa Etheridge.
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.340]   I should've asked her, are you relation?
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.180]   Any relation?
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.300]   - She's funny.
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:09.140]   I like her.
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:09.980]   - She is adorable.
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:12.820]   And thanks to Kevin Rose for picking such a winner.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:16.620]   Kevin Rose has a propensity to pick beautiful--
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:17.540]   - He has a knack.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:18.380]   He has a knack.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.380]   - He's had a knack for it.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.220]   - He has a knack.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:22.780]   He says, it's the first, I asked him, I said, come on.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:26.260]   He says, I searched for, I hate technology.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.900]   And that was the first one that came up.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:31.100]   He said, I didn't dig deep through the stack
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.100]   trying to find somebody cute.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.020]   - Yeah.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:35.860]   - But he did now.
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:36.700]   Everybody's saying, well,
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.020]   is she gonna lose her followers now?
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:38.860]   I don't think so.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:41.220]   I think she's actually pretty fun to follow.
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.380]   So it's up to her now to keep those 31,000 people happy.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:47.380]   I'm sure she can do that.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.100]   Congratulations to Lisa.
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:53.980]   And congratulations also to our cartoonist, Floyd Norman.
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.140]   Who is there?
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:57.300]   (laughing)
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.500]   I hope that, I mean, I don't see how it could not be random.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.660]   That's, I mean, that's who we got.
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:03.020]   - You got Floyd Norman.
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:05.420]   - I mean, how could that not be random?
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:06.260]   - That's amazing.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.820]   He's the American animator who worked on the Walt Disney--
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:09.940]   - No, you lie.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.140]   Is that true?
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:12.620]   - People are saying in the chat room,
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:14.300]   - That he's famous?
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:15.140]   - Yeah.
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.580]   Floyd E. Norman.
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:17.620]   He's an American animator,
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:19.540]   worked for Walt Disney Sleeping Beauty,
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:21.700]   swared in the stone in the jungle book.
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:25.740]   Is this guy look like he's 75 years old?
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:26.580]   - Yeah.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:27.420]   - Proximal.
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.620]   - No, he says back at Disney today
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:30.780]   after lecturing at USC.
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.020]   - You picked this guy, I mean, literally,
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:35.900]   look up Floyd Norman on Wikipedia.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:36.900]   This guy's the biggest guy.
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.220]   - This guy also worked on,
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:39.860]   hey, hey, hey, it's Fat Albert.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.300]   (laughing)
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.540]   - He's Twitter is an amazing thing.
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:47.220]   - Wait a second, he was involved in Pixar,
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:48.500]   Toy Story 2 and Munster Zing.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.060]   There's some sort of fix going on.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.980]   I think Steve Jobs is controlling the Twitter.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:53.500]   - Hey, hey, hey, he probably doesn't,
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.860]   you know what Floyd, if you don't want the iPad,
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.140]   we'll find a charity you can give it to.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.260]   - You're like, school on Saturday.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.860]   - Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.420]   - I love the iPad.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:06.060]   (laughing)
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.540]   This iPad is amazing.
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:09.980]   (laughing)
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:13.940]   - All right, is it possible that there was a fix in there
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.380]   that, no, I think that was random.
[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:16.260]   I think that was the guy.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:21.260]   We just, we've just happened to pick a famous guy.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:24.220]   - It's, yeah, it could happen.
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.220]   (laughing)
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.540]   - It just happened that way.
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:27.820]   He's following Lisa.
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:30.700]   So he must've wanted it.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:34.100]   He must be a listener, right?
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:36.260]   We have, many of our listeners are--
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.100]   - Absolutely.
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.860]   - Wonderful, talented, accomplished people
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:41.220]   in many different fields and that's just what happened.
[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.940]   Do you think it's credible that 700,
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.380]   stop that Robert, stop it.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.420]   Look at that face.
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:48.260]   - Sun disturbing.
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:49.100]   - What a put them.
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:50.980]   Oh, fun, I'm only a mother could love.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:53.340]   What, do you think there's any credibility to the idea
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.940]   that they might have sold 700,000 in the first day?
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.020]   Is that possible?
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:58.820]   That's absolutely--
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:30:59.740]   - I think it is.
[01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:00.740]   - Yeah.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:01.580]   - I think it is.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:05.180]   - Predictions for sales in the first year.
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:08.060]   - No, no, I think it's very possible.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:13.060]   The UPS trucks here were very, very busy dropping off iPads
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.660]   all day long.
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:21.500]   Based on what I'm seeing, I think it's very possible.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:25.700]   - There is going to be a lot of interest in this device
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.860]   because of the hand feel.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:32.460]   I think people really are like,
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:34.420]   it's got a major, like the iPhone
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.100]   and has such major buzz around it.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:36.940]   People are just gonna get it.
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:40.380]   I picked it up and went to dinner with my wife
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:42.020]   and we were using it in a restaurant
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:45.660]   and literally we had 15 people around us in the restaurant
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:47.100]   and then we went to the movies.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.700]   So I just, as I was walking in the movie theater,
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.940]   I just held it up in the air and I said,
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:51.780]   I have an iPad.
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:52.620]   (laughing)
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.860]   I literally, it was very obnoxious but funny.
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:57.020]   I have a video of it I have to get from my brother-in-law
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.100]   but I was just walking around going,
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.660]   "This is an iPad.
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:00.500]   "This is an iPad.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:01.460]   "Would anybody like to touch it?"
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:03.900]   And literally there were 30 people around me
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:06.500]   touching the iPad and the manager of the
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:09.420]   movie came over and said,
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:11.060]   "Sir, you have to stop that."
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.220]   And I said, "Stop what?"
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.900]   He goes, "You're advertising an iPad."
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:16.220]   I said, "I don't work for Apple."
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:19.060]   And he goes, "Sir, I can't have you trying
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.060]   "to sell an iPad in here."
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:20.900]   And I said, "What's that selling it?"
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:21.980]   "I'm on my iPad.
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.300]   "What are you talking about?"
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:25.940]   (laughing)
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.020]   But it's got that same appeal.
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.860]   Remember when you, when I first got the iPhone,
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.300]   I just, you know, remember that it was sold out
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:34.380]   for a month or two and when the first gem one came out
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.020]   and I was at a poker table and I took it out
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.580]   and I go, "Look, I flopped an iPhone."
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.540]   And I put it on the table and everybody was like,
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:40.380]   "Let me see the iPhone."
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:41.700]   And I was like, "Five dollars."
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:43.660]   And people started throwing me five dollar chips
[01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:45.140]   to hold it and play with it.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:45.980]   It was pretty tough.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:48.100]   I give the back, but it's got that same buzz.
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:49.820]   So this thing's gonna sell millions.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:52.500]   And I think parents are gonna buy this for their kids.
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.460]   I think kids are gonna like this more than they like
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.140]   in Xbox, you know?
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:58.580]   It's got more appeal than in Xbox or a PlayStation
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.300]   or in, you know, I guess they had to--
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.620]   - I'm sorry, it's bad that.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:02.460]   - Really?
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:03.300]   - Yeah.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.900]   - You'd rather have this in an Xbox, Patrick?
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.380]   - Well, I'm already looking for a new thing
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:09.100]   to replace my laptop, so why can't I replace my Xbox too?
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:11.380]   - I wonder if schools, you know, my kids' schools
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.820]   give them a MacBook when they matriculate $1,000 MacBook.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:17.340]   And I'm wondering if these schools might be looking at,
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.220]   this is an alternative, I don't know, is it as complete?
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.380]   - No, it can't replace that for a little.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.860]   You need a keyboard, I mean, this keyboard--
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:28.380]   - Cut to the movies.
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.460]   - I mean, it's the key.
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:31.820]   - Robert--
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:34.340]   - I haven't looked at the pages app yet, but if it's good enough
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.460]   you have the keyboard attachment, why not?
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.940]   - Let it up, spend the 10 bucks.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.260]   - All right, we're spending the 10 bucks.
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.860]   - I already bought pages, keynote, and I work as,
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:45.100]   or the whole I work suite in as many did numbers,
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:47.740]   and you know, it's, yeah, it's totally usable.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.700]   And I frankly like the keyboard, although--
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:50.540]   - Wait a second.
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.420]   - All you have to do is give them a $60 Bluetooth keyboard
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:54.420]   and they got a full keyboard then.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:56.900]   - Well, that is just watching Patrick's been typing
[01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:59.980]   on the forums on the iPad, he's doing just fine.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:02.140]   - Yeah, I mean, the keyboard's very useful, I think.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.900]   I mean, I would definitely want a physical keyboard
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.500]   if I was going to write a paper on it,
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:06.340]   but I have a Bluetooth--
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.180]   - That's what I'm talking about.
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:09.180]   Yeah, if you're gonna write two sentences, you're fine.
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:10.780]   If you're gonna write over a paragraph,
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:12.180]   you're dead in the water.
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:14.220]   - What about, and maybe that's why they didn't put cameras
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:16.620]   in it, actually, what about textbooks?
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:20.180]   I imagine that all your textbooks will be on here, right?
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:21.500]   - I would love that.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.260]   - That's where, by the way, that's where you'd want
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.220]   multi-text-tasking, 'cause you don't wanna quit the textbook
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:30.500]   to go to the word processor to come back to the textbook.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:31.340]   - Absolutely.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.780]   - Maybe you need this in a laptop.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:36.780]   - Maybe, I mean, at least the screen's big enough.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.620]   I mean, yeah.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:41.380]   - I think, though, let me put it this way.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:44.220]   How much, it was school books for my kids this year
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.700]   were over $1,500.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.580]   So if you could cut $500 off the cost of the books
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:52.140]   and throw in an iPad, it's a push.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:55.740]   You cut even more off the cost of the books on my head.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:59.020]   - Yeah, well, let's look at what this disrupts, right?
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:02.260]   It disrupts the book industry.
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:06.540]   It disrupts the car entertainment industry, right?
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.140]   Because if you buy a new Toyota
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.700]   and you put a DVD system in there,
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.740]   it costs about two or $3,000 for that.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:18.660]   Well, I can buy two iPads for the back of the car for a thousand.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:20.060]   You're already a thousand ahead,
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.820]   and you have better devices.
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:25.660]   - Interesting.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:28.580]   - A couple of other quick notes.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:31.700]   Ed Roberts, the man who started MITS
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:35.740]   and made the first kit computer, the MITS Altair,
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.300]   the computer that was on the cover
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:38.700]   of Popular Mechanics Magazine,
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.340]   the cover that so inspired Bill Gates
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:45.180]   that he and Paul Allen said, "Quick, this must need software.
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:47.260]   Let's write basic."
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:50.260]   They wrote a basic in simulation
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:52.300]   without access to an Altair,
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.660]   flew to Phoenix, I'm sorry, Albuquerque,
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:58.380]   where Ed Roberts lived and where MITS was located
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:02.020]   and sold him basic and began a company called Microsoft.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.500]   Ed Roberts passed away this week
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:07.020]   at the age of 68 of pneumonia.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:07.900]   It's interesting story.
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:11.540]   He sold his company, MITS, a few years later,
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:13.820]   with a five-year non-compete, got out of computers,
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:15.620]   became a physician, something he'd always wanted to do
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.020]   and has been practicing as a physician ever since.
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:20.100]   Apparently Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates visited him
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.500]   last week on his deathbed.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.860]   And in quite a moving scene,
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.300]   he was the guy who really made Microsoft happen
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.740]   and made the personal computer revolution happen.
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:32.500]   And is kind of unknown,
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:36.140]   but I think he liked it that way.
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:39.420]   I have a feeling he didn't want to be known as a pioneer,
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:41.540]   he wanted to be known as a country doctor.
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:45.700]   - Yeah, sad.
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:48.300]   - We all go.
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:49.740]   - Yeah, we all go.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.620]   That's classy move by Bill Gates.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.060]   - I think that's a really, it was really touching.
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:54.420]   Let me see if I can get the quote,
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:58.860]   'cause he was in Macon, Georgia, Bill Gates flew to his bedside.
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:03.780]   And let me see if I can find this.
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:09.220]   Ed was willing, this is on the website,
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:14.020]   thegatesnotes.com, a joint statement from Bill Gates
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:17.860]   and Paul Allen, quote, "Ed was willing to take a chance on us,
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:19.740]   "two young guys interested in computers
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.860]   "long before they were commonplace,
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:24.340]   "and we have always been grateful to him."
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:27.620]   So, Paul covered popular electronics in January 1975.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:31.100]   Bill dropped out of Harvard,
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.740]   Paul Allen left his job at Honeywell,
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:36.300]   and Microsoft and Microsoft Basic were born.
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:39.180]   - Mizzin.
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.180]   - Yeah, the Altair.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:44.300]   - Ed Roberts was interviewed by the New York Times in 2001.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.100]   He says, "Bill Gates was a very bright kid,
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:48.260]   "but he was a constant headache at MITs."
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.940]   (laughing)
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:51.780]   - You couldn't reason with him, he added.
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:56.220]   He did his things his way or not at all.
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:38:00.420]   - That was the MO of Gates for a long time.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:02.460]   He basically is, people tell me,
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:05.420]   if he's in the room, it's basically like game over.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:08.940]   You know, he's gonna tell you what's what,
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.380]   and if you tell him any kind of dissenting opinion,
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:14.620]   he's gonna explain exactly how wrong you are,
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.300]   and in 10 minutes, you're gonna realize
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:18.500]   exactly how wrong you are and move on.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.180]   But he's become a real philosopher
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:24.540]   and very enlightened, you know, in his third act, I think.
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:28.940]   - Somebody who knows Steve fairly well recently
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.580]   said the same thing has happened to Steve Jobs,
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:32.500]   perhaps because of his illness.
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:35.940]   Steve was as confrontational as my way or the highway
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.140]   as Bill, in fact, they're both famous for their tempers,
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:40.740]   and you know, thinking they're the smartest people
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:44.940]   in the room and having no patience for fools.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:47.980]   But like Bill Gates, who's mellowed with his retirement,
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:51.900]   they say that Steve is also become a little more zen,
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.700]   a little more focused, less likely to blow up at you.
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.100]   He still very firmly believes what he believes,
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:58.300]   as I'm sure Bill does.
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:01.020]   But, you know,
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:04.100]   - I got a chance to talk to Bill at Ted,
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:08.940]   and he's just so smart, he's thinking a lot about nuclear
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.740]   and other kinds of energy,
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.780]   particularly for the third world.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:16.380]   And he's just so smart and it has such a command
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:19.540]   of the subject that he's interested in.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:22.980]   You know, you can tell he just voraciously reads on it,
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:24.660]   whatever topic he's interested in,
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:27.220]   and he memorizes facts in a way
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:30.020]   that my brain doesn't memorize them.
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:34.500]   And he's able to debate and interact with people
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:35.620]   and learn from them.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:38.700]   And I saw this go on right in the hallways.
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:42.020]   It's, he's really a remarkable person
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:43.500]   from that aspect of it.
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.980]   - Well, congratulations,
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.660]   congratulations, condolences, I should say,
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:51.020]   to Ed Roberts' family.
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:54.980]   And congratulations to Floyd Norman,
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.380]   our winner of an iPad and to Lisa,
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:59.020]   tickled Pink Lisa Etheridge,
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:02.060]   who got her self an iPad for putting up with us.
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:03.940]   Thank you very much, Jason Calicanis,
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:04.780]   for being here.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:06.460]   Happy Easter to you both, I haven't said that.
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:09.300]   And I love your pictures of London,
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:10.380]   you keep those coming.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:16.340]   - And yes, absolutely, it's fatherhood has been
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:19.700]   the greatest thing of my life, hands down.
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:20.940]   - Did you do, I guess she's too little
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.620]   to do an Easter egg hunt yet, but.
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.140]   - Too little, but we went to the park today
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.980]   where there was an Easter egg hunt.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:27.940]   And it's amazing, I'm like waking up,
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.500]   I don't know if you had this experience
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.980]   when you first had kids or whatever,
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:33.100]   but waking up at six o'clock in the morning,
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.860]   six, 30 in the morning,
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.540]   just to hang out with her, you know,
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:40.380]   like it's, and then I spend two hours with her every morning
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.180]   when she's like the most alert.
[01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:46.580]   And it's like the two best hours of the day, every day.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.460]   - That's so neat.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.300]   - I'm totally drunk on it.
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.140]   - I know how you feel.
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:53.300]   - It's just unbelievable.
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:55.660]   I like to have these moments when I look at her eyes
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:58.380]   and like we're just sitting there and she starts laughing
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:01.060]   and I have this amazing feeling of joint contentness
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.940]   that I've never experienced in my life.
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.620]   - I highly recommend everybody who's in the Twit Listening
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.660]   wanting to make a baby.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.500]   - Make a baby.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.780]   And there is.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:09.620]   - Or practice.
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:11.340]   - There is Roberts.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:13.020]   Now where'd you get this video, Robert?
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:14.300]   Is it Milan?
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:18.980]   - This is taken in the new Kelly Park in San Jose, California.
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:23.420]   They just re-decorated the park to a cost of $72 million.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:24.260]   - Wow.
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:25.100]   - Put rides in there.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:28.580]   It's really a great place to take young kids to.
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.780]   And Milan just loved this roller coaster.
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:32.980]   He wants to ride it forever.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:34.940]   So this is actually off of Flickr,
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:39.140]   which shows again, Flickr has gone with the iPad
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:40.740]   compatible video.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:44.500]   And so I shot this on my 5D and uploaded it to Flickr.
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.660]   And now you can play that video on iPad.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:49.060]   - Isn't that awesome?
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.180]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:54.620]   And I've been looking at Floyd Norman's Twitter account.
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.900]   And in fact, I think he probably joined Twitter
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:58.940]   to win an iPad 'cause Lisa is his second follow.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:03.020]   Second person he followed after creating his Twitter account.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.860]   So I have a feeling he's there because of it.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:06.420]   I'm really glad Floyd won and I hope we can get him
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.700]   on the show next week.
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:08.780]   - I thank you all for being here.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:12.220]   Robert Scobel is the scobelizer.com is his blog.
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:16.180]   Does Patrick have a blog he wants to plug, Robert?
[01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:17.020]   - I don't know.
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:19.020]   - No, not at the moment.
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:19.860]   (laughing)
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:24.300]   - He has a Facebook and a MySpace page, but.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.500]   - Eh, what are you gonna do?
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:27.380]   - Hold on, hold on.
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:29.900]   I got a video for you to pull up.
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:34.900]   It's a video of the first, what it's like to be first in line
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:38.940]   at the Apple Store.
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:39.780]   - I saw that.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.940]   That was, that looked like a cult.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.260]   (laughing)
[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:44.260]   - That video.
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:46.260]   - You were on CNN, right?
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.100]   - Oh yeah.
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:48.740]   - Break it through the line.
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:49.580]   - Yeah.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:52.180]   (screaming)
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:53.300]   - There you go.
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:56.300]   - This is what it's like to be at the Apple Store.
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.460]   We waited 22 hours for that.
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:42:59.300]   - What's fun?
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.420]   Yeah, we had our cameras out there,
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:02.620]   but they got tired and went home.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:05.140]   - And the line was that Katie wrote Chattrellette.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.220]   He stayed all night.
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:08.540]   - The kid who wrote Chattrellette
[01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:09.980]   was in the Palo Alto store line.
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:11.580]   I thought he was a Russian kid.
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.140]   - He was there from Moscow.
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.940]   He went to, he came to Palo Alto
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.340]   just to hang out in line with us.
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:20.540]   And Jason, you think your sites are incredible?
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.380]   He's in three months, Chattrellette's gotten 20 million
[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:26.020]   unique views in just the last 30 days.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:28.460]   He showed me his Google Analytics.
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:29.300]   It's just.
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.140]   - It's crazy.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:30.980]   - Unbelievable.
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:32.260]   - Global trend, I mean.
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:34.940]   How are you monetizing what you do from here?
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:37.700]   I mean, that's really gonna be the question.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:41.660]   - There were two VCs, one sleeping on both sides of it.
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:42.860]   (laughs)
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:45.460]   I'm a feeling that somebody has a way
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:46.740]   to make money with us.
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.780]   - He's the next Mark Andreessen, I think.
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:51.100]   - You know what, that's more reflective of the fact
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:53.460]   that VCs have no idea what they're doing.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.540]   - And no imagination.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:55.700]   - 80% of the time.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:56.540]   - Yeah.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:44:00.460]   - And 20% having to do with what he's built,
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.540]   which is still significant,
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:04.620]   but venture capitalists are so unimaginative
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:06.700]   that if they just see something spike,
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:08.660]   they're like, oh, let me throw money at that.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.300]   - Looks good to me, y'all take it.
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:13.020]   Hey, can I see that curve one more time?
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:15.860]   Well, the curve is going up like a hockey stick.
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.020]   They give you a 10-inch of power.
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:18.580]   - Here's some money.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.420]   Jason Calicanis is at mahalo.com.
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:23.620]   That's the place to go to find out.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:25.780]   Hey, by the way, thank you for the white label.
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:26.620]   What is it, Twit?
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.460]   - Yeah.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:28.300]   - What is it, Twit?
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:29.140]   Questions.
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:30.980]   - Yeah, we know just Twit questions.
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:34.140]   Basically, we took our Mahalo Answers platform
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.940]   and we made it white labelable.
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:38.500]   So it's sort of WordPress for Q&A sites.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:41.940]   So it's Twit questions, which has no questions yet.
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:44.060]   - Well, we haven't publicized it yet.
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:44.900]   - That's true.
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:46.380]   Or iPad Answers.
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.020]   iPad Dash Answers, I'm sorry,
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.540]   we have a dash in the name, it's terrible.
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:52.060]   But iPad Dash Answers is like a little vertical community
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:54.100]   just for iPad, and all those questions
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:55.980]   get syndicated back to Mahalo.
[01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:57.300]   But if you don't want to deal with Mahalo
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:58.340]   and all the other stuff going on there,
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:44:59.700]   you can just have a pure experience
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:01.220]   of answering just those questions.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.300]   - That's cool.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.180]   - Yeah, so we're gonna do it like we did one for
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:07.420]   Toyota Answers, which is just all Toyota cars.
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:09.780]   So my concept is take the Q&A platform
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:13.020]   and build it out into verticals like I did for weblogs, Inc.
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.180]   But have all of that content syndicate back up
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:18.540]   to a mother load database of other questions out there.
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:20.140]   So there's a big strategy to it,
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.700]   but I just threw this together for you.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:22.540]   - Thank you.
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:23.380]   - Take a look at it.
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:24.220]   - Thank you.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:27.220]   - Before we go, we didn't talk about accessories at all
[01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:29.460]   for this thing, like cases were,
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.380]   hey, here's a cat stand for your iPad.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:33.860]   This is Veronica Belmont's stand.
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.900]   You just put the iPad, it does need a stand,
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:38.100]   but you just put it on your cat's butt.
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.860]   And you know the beauty of this,
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:42.420]   because it doesn't get hot,
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:44.380]   you don't have to worry about that.
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:47.180]   - Is the cat Bluetooth enabled or no?
[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:49.260]   - No, but let's have a USB port.
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.100]   - Hey, oh!
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:51.180]   - Oh!
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:52.820]   All right, everybody.
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:53.780]   Thank you for being here.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:54.860]   We really appreciate it.
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:57.780]   First time we've had an earthquake live on Twitch.
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:00.340]   Thanks to Sheni Jardin, also at boimboim.net.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.420]   We'll see you next week.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:03.180]   I am Leo LaPorte.
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:05.060]   Another twin is in the can.
[01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:07.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:08.500]   All right.
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:10.660]   You on the Twitter, baby.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:11.500]   You on the Twitter.
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:12.500]   All right.
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.380]   You on the Twitter, baby.
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:15.220]   You on the Twitter.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.220]   All right.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.100]   You on the Twitter, baby.
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:18.940]   You on the Twitter.
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:19.940]   All right.
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.940]   You on the Twitter, baby.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.940]   (sings)
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.420]   Let's go around.
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:28.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.740]   (hammer tapping)
