[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   They're all morning show, better than that. They're all morning show celebrities. That's Becky Worley from Good Morning America.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   Hi Becky.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   Good afternoon, Twitters.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   How is it making it my television voice?
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   It's a wheel on Sunday afternoon.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   53 degrees in the city.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   That's radio. Clayton Morris is also here. Fox and friends. Hello Clayton.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   With the team, you can trust. Nice to see you guys.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   These are all people who get up at three in the morning.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.560]   I love it. That's right. It's perfect to do a nighttime show right now. It's perfect.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   You don't have to get up tomorrow morning, do you?
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   Yeah, I've got to do five AM shows tomorrow morning.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   We'll get you out of here quick. Now David Pogue, he's smart. He tapes all his appearances on CBS this morning, right?
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.560]   Yeah, Becky and Clayton, little tip to the wise.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   Don't do it. Who knows what she's just on track?
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   Becky and David worked together too at Yahoo Tech.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   We did. We did.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   We have. We have done videos together. Nice.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.560]   Yes.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   Great to have you all. You had a good piece this morning on Sunday on the CBS Sunday morning about recreating actors.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   You call them digital doubles.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   You said I didn't realize this, that more than a hundred actors have posed, have been scanned for movies,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   including Angelina Jolie, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Sigourney Weaver, Dwayne Johnson.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   Aren't they worried about losing their livelihood?
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   It's really complicated. One of the reasons they do this is, of course, if the original actor has died.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   So Rogue One, the Star Wars movie with the dead Peter Cushing resurrected,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   kind of started all this.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.560]   And when I saw that movie, I did not realize that he was completely computer-generated.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   I read that later.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.560]   So they're not using old clips and kind of jamming them in.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   They actually created a whole new character based on scans.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   This is totally different. They did the same thing with Paul Walker in Furious 7.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.560]   You may remember he died partway into filming.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.560]   And they, of course, resurrected the 20-year-old Princess Leia for Rogue One.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   So you might be interested in, we can make him talk about this later, but what started me on this idea for a story for Sunday morning
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   was not recreating people's faces and bodies digitally,
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   but Adobe's demonstration in November of a new Photoshop for the voice.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   This is a program where you can feed it recordings of some famous person 20 minutes worth,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   and then type in anything you want, and it will say in that person's perfect voice, anything you want.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   It's like the dawn of audio fake news, and Adobe suddenly like clammed up.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.560]   Sorry, we're not talking about this anymore. No, you can't interview us.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   No, we can't give you that.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.560]   Time was a little bad.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.560]   Because a lot of people put it out, "Well, this would make it trivial to fake anything."
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   Well, that was the thrust of my story today.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   It's like, yeah, cool that you can resurrect dead actors, but isn't...
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.560]   What does evidence mean anymore?
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.560]   Like, if you can make any video of any person doing something that they never did,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   indistinguishable, isn't that the ultimate fake news?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   You talked to somebody from USC who is building a human scanning system using $120 cameras
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   in a Home Depot shower curtain.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   So this could be done at home, in other words.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   It can't lead.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.560]   That was the point of visiting that guy,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   is that this isn't a million dollar thing anymore.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   This is something you can build super cheaply in your own basement
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   and start creating digital doubles in your free time.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   This is fascinating to me because I think Arnold Schwarzenegger a few years ago
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   when they did that Terminator Youth Ooh.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560]   The Youth in Tim.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   The Youth in Tim.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.560]   I remember him saying he thought this was the future of movies,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.560]   and for those guys who are being aged out of those action roles,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   is it possible?
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   I mean, we've seen this in a number of movies as you pointed out,
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.560]   but even like in the X-Men,
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.560]   when they're looking pretty crappy back then with Patrick Stewart,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   remember he looked all cherubic in the few X-Men films ago.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   They even tried this with Brandon Lee and the Crow after he, you know,
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   he was killed on the set and they tried to digitally morph him into the end scenes of the Crow.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   I don't know.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.560]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   There is isn't there an uncanny valley though.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560]   I mean, we're not quite.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.560]   I don't know.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   I didn't see the Rogue One.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   Do they look real?
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   I guess they did.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560]   Peter Cushing looked like this.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   I don't even know what character that is.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   That's how deceptive it was.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   What did you guys see?
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.560]   That the guy with the funny hat.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560]   Oh, no, it's Tarkin.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.560]   Tarkin, yeah.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.560]   You'd know if you saw him.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.560]   He's got, he's really skeletal with caved in Sheik's knees,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560]   Britishian.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   You would have died, I like he's very, he's the number two to Darth Vader.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   Grand Admiral Tarkin, yeah.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   He says that the battle star is nearly operational, Lord Vader.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   That guy.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   Oh, that guy.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   That's really Skeletor guy.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   Now I know he's talking about it.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   To answer your question, Leo.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.560]   So Uncanny Valley is this place where completely computer generated humans has been stuck for
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.960]   the last 15 years where there's something a little off, like theoretically they should
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.280]   look normal, but they look a little off.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.400]   And the argument of this story now is that we have finally exited Uncanny Valley.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.360]   They can now make characters on screen that are completely computer generated that are
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.560]   so real you literally cannot tell the difference.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   Action movies are such a big thing right now, especially because they really market well
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.560]   globally.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   And in action movies, you don't actually have to know how to act.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   So I think it doesn't really matter.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   It does.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.560]   It does.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   I wonder what this does to the stunt double too.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   You know, like, are, or would this make more stunt doubles fewer actors?
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   They'd have them in more scenes and they'd need them and they'd need them and they'd
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   digitally put their faces on there.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   Well, I also hope for a day when I can retire, but there'll be enough footage of me.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   But they can-
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   Keep the show going.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.560]   The show goes on where they're without me.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.560]   Like, chucky cheese.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.560]   So it could be like, you know, like you come out every hour and they just would have enough.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   There's enough audio recordings of you that they could probably do something.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.560]   Right.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   Every hour.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   Hello boys and girls.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   Welcome to a Twitter.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   So this is Tarkin from our Rogue One.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   What happened?
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   And notice he's kind of dimly lit.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   If you stall it, it looks- his hair even looks a little plait.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   There is uncanny valley here.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.560]   But the thing is, it's a short scene that moves very quickly.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.560]   So-
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   Well, I don't know.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.560]   You know, my story from CBS Sunday morning this morning is online.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:26.560]   And they chose for that some really dead on close up, well lit dialogue scenes of Tarkin.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   And I mean, when I saw the movie, I didn't know.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   It's really good.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.560]   And inevitably they'll get better and better and better at this.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   Do you guys see in one of those recent Avengers movies, they youthened Robert Downey Jr.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.560]   They made him like 25 or 20 as a rebellious teen or something?
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.560]   It was amazing.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.560]   It was amazing, but I feel like they- I was going to ask you about that if that was in your piece or not.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   Because that seemed to me, it was kind of like- it was like they were not making it as real as they could have on purpose.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   Interesting.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.560]   That's the way I took it.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   Or, you know, when I was looking at it, I instantly knew it was digital.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   We know that he's not that young.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   So clearly there's not going to be footage of him at that young and they're going to be able to use it.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   So maybe it's that not being able to suspend disbelief.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   It's being pulled out of you because you know that he's the age he is.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   But- Here's the yes.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   That does look pretty good.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   That does look pretty good.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.560]   But do you guys watch This Is Us?
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   I spent so much of that show trying to figure out how Mandy Moore goes like 40 years between being a 20-something and a 65-year-old something.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   So even though there's no CGI on that, I feel like I spend a ton of time just believing.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   Makeup.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560]   It's amazing.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.560]   You should see the portrait of me in my basement.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.560]   It's-
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.560]   Florian.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.560]   Florian.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   And I think as my understanding, unless the technology is advanced, that they also sometimes use real actors and then modify them slightly.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   This one is-
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   That's what you're seeing here.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   So they got another actor on the left, that's Guy Williams, who looks a little bit like Tarkin to where the motion tracking dots on his face.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.560]   And he performed all the lines.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.560]   So that's how they got his mouth to move and they got the accent right.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.560]   He sounds a lot like Peter Cushing.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   And then they overlaid Cushing's face on that performance.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.560]   Before she died, Princess Leia said- I shouldn't call her Princess Leia, that's kind of-
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:37.560]   Said that she will not be in future Star Wars movies that she knows for a fact they're not going to do that to her, right?
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   There was some debate over that.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   It's interesting because actors increasingly are now putting it in their wills.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560]   Right.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.560]   What's allowed to be done with them.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   I think Robin Williams, for example, said for something like 25 years-
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560]   You can't use my image.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   No way, no.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.560]   Remember Fred Astaire dancing with a vacuum clip?
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.560]   We had an ad-
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.560]   Swiffer?
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.560]   Swiffer?
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   Swiffer?
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.560]   I mean, whatever that was.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   Yeah, it was something like that.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   I mean, they've been doing this for a while and you figure 25 years from now, Robin Williams will resurface and it'll be in ads and stuff.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.560]   And I wouldn't want that.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   Which again leads me to that question I asked you at the very beginning.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   Why would these actors allow themselves to be?
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   So the Fred Astaire one, I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   First of all, that's a different matter.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   They're taking existing footage.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   Right.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   There's nothing new created.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:31.560]   But the reason I think that one is so significant is because his widow gave permission.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   Right.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.560]   The estate sold.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   But his children said no way.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.560]   So obviously the rule now is get the estate's permission.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   Right.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   Look at all of you.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.560]   You'd all be happy with that.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.560]   But what if some agree and some don't?
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560]   That's where it gets tricky.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   Or what if things change where the language is even written into the contracts like this new technology doesn't even exist?
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   I mean, like Johnny Cash is a state.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   I think weren't they upset that they used a ring of fire for a hemorrhoids commercial?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   [laughter]
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   That's a shoe fits.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   I'm just saying.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   Michael Jackson, the O performance in Las Vegas.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   He appears on stage.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.560]   I saw that.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   Not O.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   There's a Michael Jackson show.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.560]   Yeah, but it's Cirque du Soleil.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   And so to answer your question.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   One.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   That's it.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560]   One.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   That's it.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   Thank you.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.560]   Why these performers would want to do it is because there is a form of artistry in that.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   I mean, when the hologram appeared on stage, I will completely admit it.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.560]   I cried.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.560]   It was so surprising and emotional.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:45.560]   Growing up in the Michael Jackson era, it was sort of, it shocked me a little bit.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   It's how an artist would want to expand the boundaries even after death.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.560]   My memory of it though is it looks almost like a pepper's ghost kind of illusion.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.560]   It intentionally doesn't, it's a little ghostly, right?
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   Yeah, it's not trying to be perfectly human and exactly matching flesh.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   Otherwise you'd go, what the hell?
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.560]   What's he doing there?
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560]   Right?
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.960]   And you got used to it really fast too.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.400]   It was the initial surprise.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.360]   And then once it was there for a couple of minutes, it was, it's like all technology
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.440]   you assimilated into your, your, your thinking so quickly.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.360]   The larger question though, which you raised at the very beginning, David, is well, what
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.760]   does this do to facts?
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.960]   What does this do to you?
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.040]   We used to say photos or didn't happen.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.440]   Well, that clearly is no longer proof of anything.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.760]   You could make anything up.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.760]   You need a body.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.760]   You need a body.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.760]   Like big foot.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.760]   Like big foot.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   Body or it didn't happen.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   Yeah, right.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.840]   I interviewed three people for this and they all had, they had three different answers.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.600]   So the first guy who does this all the time said, well, look, nowadays you pretty much
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   know if a photo is real, right?
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.160]   Like, either you go, oh, that's fake or oh, that might have been faked.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.160]   Or yeah, that's plausible.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.920]   I mean, we have a, we've learned to have a filter and he said the same will be true
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.480]   of videos that this won't be a problem because we'll kind of know.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.680]   The second guy said, oh yeah, we're in deep doo doo.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.000]   This is going to be a disaster.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.200]   We're just going to all have to become more skeptical consumers.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.800]   And the third guy said, we need to start coming up with rules.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.120]   We need to make some laws, we need to convene a body on the ethics of creating scenes that
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.520]   never existed.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.120]   Yeah, fascinating.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:40.440]   And nevertheless, you can have all the rules in the world, but it doesn't really, it's
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.800]   not going to prevent somebody from doing it if they're malicious, right?
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   Right.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.640]   But if there's a penalty for doing so, that might be a start.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.440]   They may never even be detected.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   Right.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.440]   In the world, we live in technology.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.160]   It's clearly outpaced our ability to adjust.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.080]   And, I mean, and forget Congress, forget the courts, forget laws.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   They're way behind.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.000]   We can't even adjust to it in real time.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.520]   Well, who I thought even like Amazon tonight at the Oscars is going to have a, you know,
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.680]   a movie in the Academy Awards, Manchester by the Sea is an Amazon studio.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.120]   I mean, who, if you would have kind of predict that a few years ago.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.760]   Well, we, and we interviewed one of the nominees for animated short.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.240]   It's a Pearl and it was a Google spotlight store.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.400]   Remember the Google spotlight?
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   You can actually still get it.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:38.520]   It's a 360 degree movie that about a girl, it's five minutes long in a car and you can
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.400]   watch her grow up basically.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.800]   And because it's 360, I mean, this is a whole new medium for filmmakers, right?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.120]   And this is nominated for an Oscar.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   The first 360 degree virtual reality film nominated for an Oscar.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.040]   I, we, we, we, clearly we're entering that new world.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   That's amazing.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   I'm not convinced.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   I'm not convinced.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.800]   Well, you know, I think for as, and I did ask the director, I said, you know, can you,
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.240]   can you really tell if you watch this, have you seen Pearl?
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   David, because if you watch it, it really does tell a story, but it's very limited, right?
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.000]   Because you know, you can't control the point of view as a.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Right.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Now, stop right now.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Stop right.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Yeah, I am.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Stop your cursor right now.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   So the problem with VR movies is that.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   You're looking at the wrong window.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.960]   We're looking at the wrong window.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.240]   The purpose of a director is not just to direct the actor, it's to direct your attention.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   Right.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.440]   And I could sit here for five minutes and miss it.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.680]   That was the stupidest movie ever.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.320]   It was just a bunch of driving.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.800]   What's the point though?
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.520]   What's the value of 360 if you're supposed to look in one direction the whole time?
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.960]   360 is amazing for GoPro surfing videos.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.480]   Not for narrative fictional accounts, in my opinion.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.520]   Well watch, because if he wins an Oscar, that's going to change a lot of things.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.800]   Well, I mean, there's innovation and then there's, you know, something that's really
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.760]   going to be the trajectory.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.600]   And I think those don't necessarily the same thing.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   Let's take a break.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.040]   None of you are in Barcelona.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.680]   Don't you don't don't you like hamo in the barico?
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.040]   I like the cold wine.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.640]   Go for the ham, stay for the sangria.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.640]   Salty sardines.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.760]   Oh, delicious.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.400]   But we, but we, but there are lots of people in Barcelona this weekend getting ready for
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.200]   mobile world Congress which starts tomorrow.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.240]   We had a number of press conferences already.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.880]   A lot of new phone announcements.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.720]   We'll talk about some of those, including Samsung's announcement, which started 25 minutes
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:39.040]   late and as a result, I had to cut it off so I could go do the tech guy show.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   It's good.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   It didn't announce anything important.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   I'll show today brought to you by Betterment.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.080]   This is, I tell you what, taking the world by storm.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.600]   Everybody you need to invest, you need to save right for your future.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.400]   And a lot of people try to do it themselves, but there's a better way.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:04.720]   Betterment customers can expect 4.3% higher returns and a typical do it yourself investor.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   Why?
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.080]   Because Betterment is automated.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.200]   It automatically diversifies rebalances.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.680]   These are lower.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.080]   The computer does things like tax loss harvesting.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.160]   It'd be hard for you to do, but they do automatically, which lowers your investment taxes, increases
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.520]   your after tax returns.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.560]   And it's a total end solution.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:28.520]   So faster cash transfers, tax forms available at the earliest possible date.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.840]   If, you know, many of us have old traditional advisors and you'll tell you what, you're
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.120]   lucky if you get your forms, your 1099 investment forms in March or April.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.880]   Everything is completely secure.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.080]   Betterment is the largest independent automated invested service with more than $5.5 billion

[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.960]   are.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.360]   No minimums to sign up either.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.360]   I love that.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.720]   So you can go, you can give it a try.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   You can understand it.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.760]   Save up to six times on fees, no trade fees, no transaction fees, no rebalancing fees.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.440]   And you can even use the investment dashboard at Betterment to keep track of your other
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   investments.

[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.240]   Betterment provides investing advice through smart technology and real people to help with
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   account support 24/7.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.920]   Investing does involve risk, but I'll tell you what, right now get a month managed free

[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:36.640]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.240]   David Pogue, Becky Worley, Clayton Morris.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.040]   I feel like it's the morning show team.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   This is good.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   I like doing this.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.600]   We're missing NBC, I think.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.320]   Screw him.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.800]   We probably know whoever's over there.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.160]   We probably know them, right?
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.320]   Everybody seems like I'm looking over to headline news now and I see, I see Michaela
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.480]   and then Erica Hill right after Michaela Pereira.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   That's wild.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   All the tech TV people.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.480]   I'm glad they've succeeded.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.680]   The diaspora.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.600]   Where I failed.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   Let's see.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.080]   Uber, I guess we should talk about Uber.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.960]   This was a bad week for Uber.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.440]   Bad week for Uber.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.440]   I'm really torn.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:24.800]   I like using Uber, but increasingly I'm starting to feel like this is not a great company.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:30.120]   Most recently, one of Uber's employers, a programmer, Susan Fowler wrote a blog post
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.540]   in Diting Uber.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.000]   She worked there for a year and has since left for its treatment.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.600]   I love Cara Swisher's article about it in which Cara points out, she says it's all
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.240]   about the leather jacket.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.880]   Should I tell that story?
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.320]   Then Becky, I'd like to hear a woman respond.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.640]   You're our token woman.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   So.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.480]   Give me up, Leo.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.080]   Recode Cara Swisher.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.880]   For the wad of a leather jacket is Uber lost, she tells, among all the really just horrific
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:13.000]   HR stories, she was harassed in all sorts of ways HR never responded.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.480]   But the one that Cara says was most telling and that she says everybody, every woman in
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:26.760]   Silicon Valley will understand, Uber ordered leather jackets, but only for the men because
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.920]   they got a bolt discount.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   They got a discount.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:39.280]   There are only six women left and they said, well, it would be discrimination to buy you
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.760]   jackets because we get a better discount on the 120 jackets we're buying for the 120
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   men.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.880]   It would cost us more to buy you jackets, so we're just not going to get you jackets
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   at all.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.960]   Susan writes, we were told if we wanted leather jackets, we women needed to find jackets with
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.120]   the same prices, the bulk order price of the men's jackets.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.560]   Now who cares about jackets, but it is kind of, it tells you something about the culture,
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   right?
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.600]   And this was a director that told her that.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:17.880]   That is the overarching kind of, it gives you an indication of the institutionalized perception
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.280]   of women at the company.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.720]   But I mean, just to peel it back and go back to this story that Susan Fowler told about
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.840]   her manager, that's the one that really blew me out of the water.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.080]   This is right when she started.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:36.920]   She started as a developer in the reliability department, SRE, they call it.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.160]   I'm just going to read from this blog that she wrote because I think it's really important.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.560]   On my first official day rotating on the team, my new manager sent me a string of messages
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.120]   over a company chat.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   He was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.920]   new partners, but he wasn't.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.840]   He was trying to stay out of trouble at work, he said, but he couldn't help getting into
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   trouble.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.680]   I was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.720]   And it was so clearly out of line, I took screenshots and reported him to HR.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.600]   HR did nothing in this, and then now I'm paraphrasing, did nothing.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.240]   They told a woman that he is a very high performer.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   And it's the first time.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.760]   It's the first time this has never happened before.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   Right.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760]   What a lie.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760]   Except it had.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.840]   Because he had other employees.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.000]   I mean, this is- The HR department, you're supposed to be able to go to the HR department
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.720]   because not facing any retaliation from anybody in the company.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.760]   If you don't feel safe being able to go to the HR department, you're in trouble.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:40.360]   And there was a company culture, this toxicity, even within the HR department, which was new
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.920]   that this was not the first time that this guy had done this.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.080]   And it was also lying to her and all their women inside the company.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.480]   Now Uber did immediately respond.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:57.840]   Travis Kalanek, the CEO and founder of Uber hired Eric Holder, former attorney general,
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.720]   to lead an independent investigation.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:07.120]   Is that- And said, we certainly, I didn't know about this and I would never condone this,
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.200]   and we're going to get to the bottom of this, and we're going to root this kind of institutional
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   sexism out.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   I don't know.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.040]   I mean, Lance Ulanoff wrote a great article about this basically saying that you're
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.320]   going to be, this is just a reaction to the press and that they also pulled out Ariana
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.560]   Huffington, who's on their board and says she'll be on it.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:31.400]   And she said that the company would no longer be hiring quote, brilliant jerks.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.520]   But where has she been the last 12 months?
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.640]   I don't, I mean, this is obviously an institutionalized problem.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.240]   And I was, okay, so let's just say that they have finally gotten the message, that this
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.040]   is not a good culture for women.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.440]   I think they stated that they had 15% of their engineers were women and that it's, they're
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.040]   trying hard to create a more woman-friendly environment.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   It's a sound runner.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.440]   Post said, by the time I left a year later, most of the women had left, there were only
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.240]   three or four women engineers left.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.040]   So the big questions are, do they get it?
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.400]   And then how do you, is this, even if they get it, how do they reboot their corporate
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   culture?
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.400]   I was trying to think of companies that have been-
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.400]   We have.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.400]   Right.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.440]   That's going to happen here because once they start peeling this onion back, and you know,
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.480]   especially when you have a former attorney general in there, he's not going to let anything
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   just go.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.080]   They're going to start to peel this onion back.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.000]   What they're going to do is they're going to have this, it's an independent investigation.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.400]   They're not bound by Uber in any way.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.680]   They're going to be bringing people in former employees and current employees and they're
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.360]   going to tell them, look, you have full and unfettered ability to tell the truth in this
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.360]   room.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.720]   And you're going to let us know, did this ever happen?
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.360]   They're going to ask them series of questions.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.120]   They're going to go down the line and they're going to start to find stuff.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.280]   They're going to start to peel this onion back.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.720]   And the assessment that they come up with is going to be damning.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.920]   I mean, it's going to be either, you got a clean house.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.600]   You've got a laundry list of people who were covering up for these individuals.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.120]   And there's going to either have to be a clean house.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.120]   I mean, I've already enjoyed deleting Uber off my phone.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.200]   So did you, yeah, that's my question.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:17.120]   There was a delete Uber movement earlier when Uber, after the taxi strike at JFK, Uber
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.480]   sent an announcement saying, we eliminated surge pricing, taken Uber.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.240]   And everybody said, wait a minute.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.360]   And then the hashtag delete Uber, I don't, frankly, I don't think that was fair.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.120]   I don't, I don't know if that really was a good reason to delete Uber.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.560]   It could very well have been an automated who know, I mean, I don't, you know, and then
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.840]   they were trying to be responsive saying, well, you know, we've had problems with surge
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.960]   pricing before people seeing that as predatory.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.680]   So we're not going to do it and it backfired on them.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.360]   But I have to say that I think the outcome that Clayton described might be one possible
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:55.720]   outcome, but I think a more likely outcome will be as, as the blog post by Uber investors
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.680]   pointed out, Eric Holder is not independent.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.160]   Eric Holder is on their payroll.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.840]   He's being his firm is being paid to do this investigation.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.560]   He has been involved on previous Uber investigations.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.360]   You may recall and nothing has changed.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:15.400]   This is not the first really nasty smell we've had coming from, from Uber.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.080]   I mean, they've been in one mess after another.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.680]   It's also a continuous drum beat of this.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.840]   Like getting the newest story is the, is the, is the self driving car lie that they were
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.840]   just caught in.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   Okay.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   So that was an interesting way in San Francisco.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.240]   There's video of out in front of the Museum of Modern Art, a very crowded area down by
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.240]   Moscone Center.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.720]   A lot of people are familiar with it.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.920]   A guy's watching as an Uber whizzes through a red light and just misses a pedestrian.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   And Uber, when confronted with that said, Oh, you know what, that the human had taken
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.000]   over.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.080]   That was a human error, which not that makes me feel any better, but, and now it turns
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.920]   out that was a lie Clayton.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.680]   Because, and you remember their PR statement that they had released back in December and
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.200]   it was widely reported and people were like chunking it out saying that this sounds like
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.800]   that they're wording this to mislead at the time that it sounds like there was a, you
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.720]   know, there was a human driving the car.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.120]   But if you, you know, if you started to look closely as they described, if you parsed it
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.720]   closely, it could be the case that the car was in this like autonomous mode.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.640]   It turns out it was a total lie.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.960]   I mean, how do we find that out?
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.960]   There it is.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   Here's the video.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.080]   New York times.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   Interesting.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.520]   Do you think that morning TV would accept the word douchey?
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.560]   I don't know about morning TV, but I'll take it.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.280]   That's the perfect word to describe.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.600]   You know, it really is like, yeah, but, but, but, but okay.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:47.240]   And, and some of this is because Uber had to be a combative company to disrupt the highly
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.040]   entrenched taxi companies and city after city.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:55.360]   They faced lawsuits, fights, boycotts, all sorts of, I mean, this was not an easy thing
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.360]   to do.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.840]   And in the face of it, they, they really created a billion dollar company very quickly.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:08.080]   So maybe this just combative nature of, of Kalanik and, and Uber in general is just,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.280]   you know, it, they're just an aggressive company.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   Well, I'm surprised.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.200]   I think companies like, and sorry, I was going to say, I mean, I'm surprised Lyft hasn't
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.160]   come up in this conversation yet.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   There is an alternative.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   There are many alternatives.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   There are many alternatives.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   Exactly the same thing.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   Without a bunch of douches at the helm.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.040]   Well, I downloaded, I downloaded their app, you know, when I deleted Uber off my phone.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.960]   Becky, what were you going to say?
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.480]   I just think that a lot of companies that have strong founders go through painful adolescence
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:42.200]   periods, where they're used to being able to turn the zodiac at a moments notice on a
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:48.720]   whim and act as individuals and have their personality pervade the entire company.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:55.080]   But once you start driving a Titanic, you, it doesn't work like that anymore.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.880]   Because you lose, you lose something in translation.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.640]   And this is a company that's going through a clearly a painful adolescence.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   And you know, they have whole specialists that come in and help founders transition from
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.800]   that zodiac mentality to driving the Titanic.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.720]   And the first thing that has to happen in order for that to occur is the founder has
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.200]   to, you know, go through the AA process is recognizing a problem and recognizing that
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   they are the problem.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   I love this.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.640]   I was looking up Travis Kalanick quotes.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.400]   I got a website, A Z quotes where there's a bunch of quotes.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.320]   And then at the end of the quotes, they offer some is, oh, well, since you're reading Travis's
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.520]   quotes, you might like quotes from Elizabeth Holmes, Evan Spiegel, Jack Dorsey and Michael
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520]   Arrington.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:47.160]   I guess, I guess the algorithm kind of understands what do you share?
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.360]   Now Nick Woodman, he's H, he's GoPro at Brian Chesky from Air Beauty.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:32:01.560]   So there is a certain bro spirit in a lot of our startups.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:07.280]   Is it concomitant with a startup that you have to have a certain attitude?
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.280]   Cavalier.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   Cavalier.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.960]   Is there, do we, maybe you don't have time for, by the way, I'm, I'm going to, you're
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.640]   going to shout at me if I say this, Becky, you don't have time for political correctness.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:24.000]   I'm actually more interested in this less, you know, I, I actually can't speak for this
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.360]   because I've never worked at a company that has had a toxic culture towards women.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:34.000]   I work in a company that has a very matriarchal kind of affect to it.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.080]   I mean, you don't mess with Diane Sawyer and Martha Raditz.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.280]   And so I have had quite the opposite experience.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   That's a baby.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:49.880]   And my bigger question is I don't know if corporations have the ability to recover from
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.040]   scandal like this.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.040]   Name me one company that's had a scandal that has totally fixed their corporate culture.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.520]   I, I asked on Twitter.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.920]   I mean, people said, Tycho.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.280]   I don't even know what Tycho had a big problem.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   I do remember that.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.600]   Volkswagen from the back.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.040]   Volkswagen, maybe Samsung.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   But now it's come back full circle.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.360]   But no, they're talking also about the diesel fake, your fakery that folks, wagon did last
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.840]   year or the year before.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.440]   I mean, the Catholic church.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.720]   Well, we don't know if they've come back or not yet.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   We're.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.400]   That's, but that's the thing is like I can't name like a, I can't, there's no one glowing
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.320]   example of this company had this terrible problem and they just completely fixed it and
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.320]   came back.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:38.040]   Actually, and Uber had that, that town meeting audio that was leaked last week.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.000]   So Travis, Travis met with a hundred women from the company and listened to their grievances.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.560]   And he said, okay, sorry, sorry, things will change.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.560]   I'm really sorry.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   You're right.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   You're right.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.560]   This is bad.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   We'll fix this.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.280]   But as they said in this leaked audio, but Travis, this is what you say every time and
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   nothing changes.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:05.200]   I think about Facebook, which for years had a kind of a policy, you know, forge ahead
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.000]   and apologize later.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.760]   I think that that and certainly not.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.920]   It wasn't a sexist issue.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.200]   It was issues of, you know, privacy, you know, violating user privacy and then saying, oh,
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.480]   whoops, sorry, and backing off on that.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.400]   It does seem like that's kind of the philosophy of many startups.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.520]   We don't have time for niceties.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.440]   We're going to just forge forward.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   I'm looking at Samsung.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.280]   You talk about reputation.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:37.760]   Samsung was third in brand reputation in 2015, seventh in 2016, this year after the Galaxy
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.480]   Note 7 recall 49th.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.200]   So it does hurt you.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.680]   It can really hurt you.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.520]   Well, let's talk about market forces.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.520]   So you've got the marketing problem.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.640]   Then you've got just the talent problem.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.720]   Talents are really big issue in San Francisco.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:58.440]   So if you can't get 50%, maybe not 50% of the engineers or coders have you, but if you
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:04.280]   just pretty much make yourself unattractive to a large swath of the talent, then there's
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.680]   a market force that's going to have an effect.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.880]   So what happens to Uber?
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.560]   I mean, they're well capitalized.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.520]   They're losing money very fast, but that doesn't seem to hurt anybody in today's tech
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   world.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.480]   I don't see this as a huge impact on their business, their trajectory or their bottom
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.480]   line.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.240]   I think that there were many other market forces that will affect them in a larger way
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   than this.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.720]   I think that people will have a perception of them as being douchey, but when you're
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.920]   drunk and it's 1am, you're going to call an Uber.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.520]   That's the bottom line.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.760]   That's either new slogan.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.440]   I used Lyft last week.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.280]   I was a Nashville flu back.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.560]   You used Lyft at the airport.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.480]   It worked flawlessly.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.400]   So I didn't skip a beat and deleted Uber and never looked back.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.880]   But I mean, Lyft is, I mean, it's David and Goliath.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:01.640]   I mean, Lyft is this and Uber is, I mean, they're a tiny percentage.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.480]   Chris Sodd, who is head of product at Uber and the developer platform, tweeted, "And
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.920]   I have a lot of respect for Chris.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.000]   Chris has been around for a long time.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   He said, people don't understand Uber is a great company.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   We're going to fix this.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   We want to fix this."
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.080]   He was really defending his company and saying that Fowler really had kind of overstepped.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.520]   That was an issue with, this is often what happens, by the way.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:33.160]   It happened with Ellen Powell when she sued, who did she sue?
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   I'm Reddit.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   Reddit.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   No, no, she was CEO of Reddit.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   Before she sued Reddit.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.000]   Oh, a kind of Kleiner.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.920]   Kleiner, she was Kleiner Perkins.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.440]   She sued and lost after a very vicious trial.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.800]   And I think this is one of the reasons women don't come forward.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.320]   It's kind of admire Susan Fowler for writing this piece because often they get tarred
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.680]   with that brush.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.920]   Company goes on fine.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:37:00.320]   She did such a nice job of not being hyperbolic in her description.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:07.560]   She was so understated in both everything from the title to the description of what happened.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.800]   And it was so egregious that anyone who tries to push back on her, I think, is really reaching
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:20.040]   because it was just very factual and clear and not trying to make an outrageous case.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   You mean Susan Fowler?
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.040]   Susan Fowler, yes, she really did it well.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.040]   But didn't sue.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:31.160]   But then, I mean, but Susan Fowler's thing is only, you know, the top of it.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:37.680]   Then the New York Times did that big expose after interviewing 30 people of, you know,
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   the culture and the way it is in there.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.680]   That was more than--
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   This is Amazon.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   Remember the piece they did on the--
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   Right.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   --to the Amazon piece.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   Yeah, they're things.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.680]   So I guess that's the questions I'm asking.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.320]   Our A is this kind of business as usual in startups.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.760]   They're just-- they're really inhumane.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:58.120]   They really drive people hard and they often do things, you know, that we would deem as
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.640]   reprehensible and more established as businesses like ABC.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.000]   And two, how does this hurt the company?
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.720]   There certainly is a delete Uber movement.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   Clayton did it.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.400]   He's taking Lyft from now on.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:18.560]   Or as Becky says, is this just bad publicity, but Uber will-- because when you're drunk
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.280]   at 1 a.m., who else you can call?
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   That's the tag line.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   It's survival.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.680]   I mean, the other thing is you got to remember that all these things we're talking about,
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:35.520]   like kindness and equality and fairness of rights, regardless of gender or sexually
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   or whatever.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:43.200]   Unfortunately, these are like East Coast, West Coast, liberal city feelings as we now
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.720]   know from the election.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   Yes.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:51.120]   A vast swath of the country doesn't care about treating people fairly and grabbing people
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   by the-- you know, like--
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.080]   No, I think there's a significant number of people who will just yell, "That's Susan Fowler
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.680]   and I'm going to still use Uber."
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   Right.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   And we all--
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.680]   But it's also a rush.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.840]   We were talking about before the show, we were talking about hidden figures.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:10.680]   And it wasn't so long ago where you see these three black women at NASA and the discrimination
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.720]   that they faced, the nastiness they faced.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.680]   That wasn't that long ago.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.680]   And it was just accepted.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.520]   You see all these smart engineers, male engineers with their little skinny ties and their short
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.960]   sieve white shirts saying, "I'm not going to drink that coffee."
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.960]   She just drank out of that.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.440]   She's got to have a colored only coffee pot.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   It's just tragic.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.240]   And yet, that's so recent in our memory.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.840]   Well, I think today's point is--
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.840]   Mad Men.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.000]   Mad Men, yeah.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.300]   We have a space in our collective acceptability spectrum for a lot of these behaviors.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.320]   But if you look at the trajectory of where we're going, it does point to this being unacceptable
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:54.080]   and ultimately, I hope, market forces will drive it out of the business world because
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.840]   it just doesn't make sense in the long run.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   It's not good for anybody.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.280]   Well, and that's the question.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   Is it or is it not?
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.240]   I mean, Uber's done very well.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   NASA did OK.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.040]   They got a man in space.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.200]   Maybe it doesn't hurt the company.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   Or can you make the argument?
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.720]   And I think you can that diversity makes a better product.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:17.400]   And I'm going to switch focus here to Snapchat, which is probably going to do its IPO this
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   week.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.440]   And they got a lot of pain because they did blackface filters, right?
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.920]   And then they did an Asian filter that were wholly racist.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:32.920]   And the point was made, if you have a bunch of white bro programmers writing these filters,
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.080]   it's not that they're racist necessarily.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.520]   It's not going to be sensitive to what blackface means.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.360]   It hurts the company in the long run, right?
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   It hurts the product.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   If you have a global multicultural consumer base, then you probably need to have a social
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.040]   someone who understands all of the people in that consumer base.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.640]   Well, I mean, that's the question.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.280]   Is it going to hurt the company or what?
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   You know, I don't know.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.640]   I think they're going to call me for that tagline.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   We're just drunk.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   We're drunk.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   And so suck it.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   We're drunk.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.640]   We're here.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.480]   Just don't barf in the back.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:20.000]   I took an Uber just the other day and the driver told me the most unbelievable story.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.800]   I know this isn't like typical twist stuff, but you'll enjoy this.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   So you know what the Uber pool thing is where you share an itinerary with total strangers.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.680]   So the driver's driving along and he picks up the first passenger of a businessman, sits
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.800]   in the passenger seat, gets busy on his phone.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.760]   And then the driver picks up a couple, a young couple at a later stop.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.040]   They're all going down the same highway, so they're sharing a car for less money.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.800]   But young couple gets in the back and they're making out hot and heavy, a track of young
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.280]   man and woman.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.800]   And there's no conversation that just driving along.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:01.000]   And after a while, the girl in the backseat giggles at the touch of her boyfriend and
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.640]   the passenger, the businessman in the front seat, turns around and goes, "Meghan?"
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   Oh, God.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   Oh, no.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   Yup.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:17.000]   So he didn't know that his girlfriend was cheating on him and the guy she was cheating
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.040]   on him with didn't know that she had a toilet of him.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.040]   And he's in the front seat.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.040]   He's in the front seat.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   See?
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.040]   I love him.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.240]   It's even affecting Uber's rights.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.280]   Well, it'd be interesting to watch how this affects Uber.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.600]   I think I agree with you, Becky.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.200]   It's not going to affect their business one with and it's just, they'll just go on.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.880]   It's, it, and it wouldn't be just, if it were just this incident, maybe, but it's just
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.760]   this continuous day after day story about Uber.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.280]   There's another one, Google's suing Uber.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.600]   Actually, they're suing a company, Uber, Uber acquired called auto.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.240]   That's the self-driving trucks.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:58.600]   Apparently a guy who was working for Google's Waymo, their autonomous vehicle division,
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.840]   Anthony Levin Dowsky, downloaded 14, this is in the lawsuit.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.760]   They claim downloaded 14,000 technical files from the Google servers and then launched
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:13.160]   the autonomous truck startup, Auto, which was acquired a few months later by Uber.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:19.320]   And of course, Levin Dowsky is now running the automated car division at Uber.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.400]   And so Google is now suing Uber saying, they said, we don't want to do this.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   We don't like to do this.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.600]   But boy, when somebody steals your stuff, then you got to get upset.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:33.240]   When it wired, it's actually, it's the lasers.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:41.080]   The lasers that they're using that make the LiDAR maps of the technology that was borrowed
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.080]   from Waymo.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:47.000]   Well, in reading a little bit about this story, one of the things that I found really interesting
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.800]   is that I had presumed incorrectly that Google was going to be licensing their self-driving
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:57.520]   technology to other manufacturers of cars who were already in the business.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:03.640]   But at the, I think it was at the Detroit Auto Show, one of the auto shows early this year,
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:08.760]   the CEO of Waymo, this Google self-driving car, with an alphabet.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.440]   >> Both Auto and Waymo have the best names.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.200]   I just love- >> Right.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   So good.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.200]   They tell me exactly what they're doing.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.160]   >> Waymo, it's Waymo better.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   >> Waymo better.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.760]   Hey, you're from Hawaii, Brian.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.440]   That guy is so much Waymo better.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:29.720]   But they are actually going to be making the hardware themselves, Google is, and that the
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:36.600]   LiDAR sensors can cost up to $75,000 per sensor component group.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:42.840]   And that what Waymo has done is decreased the price of that by 90% in their manufacturing
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.840]   research.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:53.760]   >> So to be able to shave $67, $68,000 off of this component is a huge advantage to them.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:45:00.080]   And so the fact that they have such compelling evidence that this guy has stolen the design
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.520]   components, I don't know if you, most people know this, what was the whole story was a
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:12.720]   supplier for Waymo accidentally emailed them.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:18.520]   They thought they were emailing auto, and they included auto's new design spec, which
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.040]   looked, oh, exactly like Waymo's.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   >> Wow.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:27.440]   >> Waymo went back and did a forensic investigation and found that this, it's not Lewandowski,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   it's Lewandowski.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.440]   >> Lewandowski, yeah.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.200]   >> Lewandowski, who came from-
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   >> Different guy.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   >> Right.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.040]   >> This guy, no connection with the Ukraine.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.040]   Okay, good.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.040]   Just a second.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.720]   >> So anyways, so they have, I mean, it's a total smoking gun in the way that it's written
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.280]   up in Google's portrayal.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.680]   >> Obviously, Waymo has a point here, and I bet they'll win and whatever.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:52.440]   But there is also the argument about what is Google doing?
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:57.120]   I mean, they were way ahead, they were years ahead, and they just sat and, oh, we're going
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.280]   to license, we're not going to license, we're just going to not do anything.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.560]   And we're going to partner, they keep changing their minds.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.320]   And meanwhile, the competitors have caught up, and in some cases, lapped them.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.560]   >> You're completely right and completely wrong, David.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.560]   And here's why.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   >> I like my wife.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.720]   >> And let me tell you why.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.720]   That's the key.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:18.720]   >> Let me tell you why.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.000]   Because I think that they had the technology, but we weren't mentally prepared for self-driving
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   cars.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.040]   So unlike Microsoft, which has the unfortunate habit of releasing technology, we're not yet
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:33.760]   ready for, and then getting skunked on it 10 years later, I think that they were waiting
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.880]   for public opinion and public awareness to catch up to the technology that they already
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.880]   owned.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.120]   That's my personal opinion, on why you're both totally right and totally wrong.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.920]   >> I feel like you could say that about everything in the Google Labs, the face recognition,
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.440]   the robots, they've got it.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   We're just not ready for it.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.400]   >> Yeah, and it doesn't work consistently enough.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   >> Right.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.520]   >> Until it works as well as that silver thing behind me where you open it up and the light
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.520]   goes on and it keeps all my food cold.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.920]   That's consistent performance.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.040]   I want to see my technology have that kind of performance.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.040]   >> Can you tweet?
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.040]   That's a Samsung, I think.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.040]   Can you tweet from that refrigerator?
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:11.840]   >> No, it doesn't cut on fire either.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.840]   >> Okay, that's good.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:17.960]   >> I had a call from somebody who had a Samsung refrigerator with an internet connection,
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.360]   and it used to have his calendar on it, but then Google changed the calendar API and the
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.640]   Samsung refrigerator has no updates, so the calendar doesn't work anymore.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.560]   This is why you don't put a calendar in a refrigerator.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.360]   >> I fooled around with those Samsung refrigerators at CES, the ones with the big touchscreen on
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.360]   the front.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.760]   >> And first of all, the scrolling speed was like a palm pilot from 1996.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.120]   It was just so bulky and slow.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.000]   I'm like, are you kidding me?
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.760]   You're going to spend $12,000 for a refrigerator that will seem obsolete next year.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.400]   >> You're going to Raspberry Pi in it.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.840]   Why is cheap out on the processor for crying out loud?
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.840]   >> Unbelievable.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.480]   >> Just a space you could snap an iPad into it.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.280]   >> I know like a little doc.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.280]   >> I don't know how to have that.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.280]   >> Right.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.280]   >> Snap.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.160]   >> I don't know if I really need a computer in my fridge, but that's another story entirely.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:12.920]   Did you buy that for GMA, Becky, is that a GMA fridge behind you there?
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   >> No, no.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.920]   >> That's not a set right now.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:15.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   >> Yes, this is my favorite.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   >> It's too pretty.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.920]   This can't be a real kitchen.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.680]   >> Yeah, Rachel Ray will be by short.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.960]   >> My goodness, there's a pie already cooked in the oven.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   Look at that.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.720]   I want to take a break.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.920]   Then we're going to talk about snap and the snap IPO.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:35.040]   Should you or should you not jump on snap snaps had its own, as I mentioned, its own issues.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:40.680]   And there's some question about whether if it snaps IP and owing at the peak, it's kind
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.840]   of the OMG, what is it?
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.000]   OMG pop phenomenon.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.280]   Remember that draw something?
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.160]   It was the app that was the hottest app in existence.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:56.200]   Then Zinga bought it and they bought them at the absolute peak.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   Maybe the same thing with snap.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.200]   I don't know.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.360]   Let's talk about euro though first.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   You know what?
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   It's a year old.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.240]   Happy birthday, Euro.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:11.520]   Euro created the mesh Wi-Fi that's changing the world.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.320]   And it is an amazing solution.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.960]   Everybody knows Wi-Fi has become a problem because there's so few reasons.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:22.640]   There's so many Wi-Fi networks in your area, congestion.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.000]   But also our houses are bigger.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   We're doing more.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.120]   We're sending more stuff over Wi-Fi.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.680]   A single router model which was great five years ago just doesn't work.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.160]   You need a distributed system.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   You need Euro.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:41.320]   The world's first whole home Wi-Fi system at Blanket's the entire home.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.120]   And fast, reliable Wi-Fi.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.680]   No more buffering, no more zent dead zones.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.840]   And this is not a repeater.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.320]   This is not a Wi-Fi extender.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.800]   Euro is much smarter than it's a mesh system.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.040]   Which means, what do we have there?
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.040]   Is that an Euro?
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.040]   I see it.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.520]   So, yep, right here my whole house is running on Eros right now.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.520]   Love them.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   It really was a transformation.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.320]   Sitting up on top of my bookshelf up there.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.480]   Euro, you manage it through an app.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.080]   It's nice because they've managed to make something that's very easy and straightforward
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.600]   to set up and use.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.840]   But if you dig deep, they have features that even some high priced fancy geek routers
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.560]   don't have.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:26.080]   They come with more memory and power than you need currently to zap Wi-Fi.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.080]   That means that they can upgrade it.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.400]   They overbuilt the Euro.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.920]   I don't know if people realize this.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.360]   But for instance, they just had the 2.0 update, which enhances the new mesh.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.160]   But there's even more capability because they overbuilt it.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.040]   They put more CPU and more memory in there.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.560]   So they can add all sorts of things.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.000]   Euro is one of the only routers that gets updated automatically all the time.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.200]   Plus, as you can see, there's no need to hide it.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.440]   It looks great.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.040]   State of the art WPA2 encryption, of course.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.040]   Great customer support.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:01.120]   Of course, I actually tested them and called them up and said, "I can't get my Minecraft
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.120]   server working."
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.960]   And they were great.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.560]   They stayed on the line until it was working.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.560]   I was very impressed.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:13.000]   You've seen them everywhere, including we've talked about them, 4.4 stars on Amazon, 750
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.320]   reviews, one year warranty.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.800]   Of course, we'll work with your existing modem and internet service.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.240]   And there's a 30 day money back guarantee.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   Euro was the original.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.640]   To celebrate their first birthday, they have permanently lowered prices.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.200]   Who does that?
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.800]   $399 for the 3-pack.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.480]   It's $100 off $299 for a 2-pack.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.600]   Each Euro is worth good for about 1500 square feet.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.760]   So many people at 2-pack could be plenty.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.040]   And the nice thing is you can always add more Eros as you need them.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:47.440]   To get Euro at its new low price, E-E-R-O.com or Best Buy or Amazon to celebrate one Euro
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.800]   of Euro.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.040]   E-E-R-O.com or Best Buy or Amazon.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.040]   Everybody loves Euro.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:01.480]   Everybody loves their Euro.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.480]   Snap.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:08.800]   I guess the latest is they're going to probably do their IPO this week, like Wednesday, March
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.920]   1.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.960]   And it's going to be big.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.960]   20 billion?
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.400]   20 billion.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:21.840]   They're going to, initial price, we're not sure, but they haven't announced $14 to $16
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:28.640]   a share that they give it a $22.2 billion market cap at that price.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:34.200]   That's considerably above their last private valuation, which was $17.8 billion.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.480]   They will have the New York Stock Exchange symbol Snap.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.160]   That's a good easy one to remember.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:47.240]   Like Uber, like a lot of companies, they have great revenue, $404 million in revenue last
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.240]   year.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.480]   That's up from $58 million a year before.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.120]   They also have great losses.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.640]   Revenue does not necessarily mean profit.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:02.800]   Their net loss, okay, remember, $404 million in revenue, they lost $514 million.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:09.760]   In other words, they spent half a billion dollars to make $400 million, not a good business
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.760]   in the long run.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.440]   They'll make it up and follow.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:18.640]   Last year before they lost $372 million, they are close to having lost a billion dollars
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.120]   in two years.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.160]   Did you read the piece by Owen Williams in Medium this week?
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.560]   And I, you know, it's an anecdotal piece about his experience noticing that more and
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.440]   more people are just not using Snapchat to sort of friends.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.440]   He's dropped off.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.840]   He said, why I'm leaving Snapchat and so are all your friends.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.360]   Well, I had an anecdotal evidence of that too.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.720]   I mean, just listening to where I was and there was like a group of teenagers.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.800]   It was like a Panera or something and they were all teenage girls.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   They were talking.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.040]   They were on their phones and they were on Instagram and they were doing stories and
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.040]   they were just sharing.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.120]   But one of them mentioned something about Snapchat and the other just kind of jumped
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.600]   in and said, oh, you know, I don't use that or we're not on that anymore.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   We're not use that anymore.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.840]   And I thought at least I was never on it to begin with, but, you know, I'm good.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.800]   I survived that little technology spike and now I've made it back.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   The cool kids.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.120]   But just when you start to see people around you, whether it's kids and, you know, 20
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:18.560]   some things and 30 some and they're using Instagram stories, you know, which came out
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:22.000]   what about a year ago now Instagram stories and at the time everyone was, oh, it's kind
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   of cute.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.480]   You know, they're trying to mock, you know, trying to copy up.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.000]   Completely copy, Snapchat, Snapchat stories, right?
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.200]   And they have the ability to because, you know, I mean, more so many people are on Instagram
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.760]   and it's just a natural extension of that platform.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:39.480]   And, you know, with the live and advertising, you know, it's like, how does Snapchat making
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.480]   money?
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   Well, they're not, right?
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.080]   So, Clay, although I thought they would, frankly, but go ahead.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   I've admitted to you.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:51.000]   You said that you don't use Snapchat, but I'm going to perform an astonishing feat of
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.920]   mind reading over the internet.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   Ready?
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.920]   Let me see.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.920]   Leo, you don't use Snapchat either.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:57.920]   Actually, I use.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   Wait, wait.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.920]   I do.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.920]   You don't either.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:01.920]   You are amazing.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   You're amazing.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   You're wrong, David.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.920]   I use Snapchat all the time.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   I love Snapchat.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   Snapchat is awesome.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   I don't have any.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   It's a story.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   What is the story?
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   I use the story.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.920]   So, so let's let's hear.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   I'll tell you what.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.920]   Let's let's get out of this.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.920]   One of the reasons a lot of adults don't use Snapchat is because it's completely opaque,
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   right?
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:28.080]   Nobody could figure out how to use it.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.720]   And oh, look, Jimmy Kimmel's just appeared.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.080]   See, this is how they make money.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.760]   There's an Oscar Snapchat filter.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.240]   Hi, kids.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.480]   I now have lipstick and sunglasses.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   So great.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.320]   This is why I use it because it's funny.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.520]   And by the way, Instagram and others have added these kinds of capabilities.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.480]   Facebook just bought a company that MSQR.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.480]   Masquerade.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.200]   Which does an amazing job and arguably better than Snapchat.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.560]   And I'm sure that we'll see that in Instagram soon.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.720]   Those filters are so addictive.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.280]   But they're addictive.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.280]   And I do.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.160]   And so I can I can record this.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.320]   I can save it to a story that easily.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:11.120]   And now people, you know, strangers can see my snaps.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.600]   But is that worth $20 billion?
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.160]   I mean, that's a feature, right?
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.400]   I mean, how easy is that?
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.400]   I mean, that's a feature.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.960]   Well, what's what's apps sold for $22 billion to Facebook?
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.600]   That was arguably not much more interesting than Snapchat.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:30.840]   But I guess what I was driving at is that 80% last time I looked at it, 80% of Snapchat
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.720]   users are female.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.240]   And a huge percentage like 60% are under 25.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.960]   It's young and absolutely.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.360]   It's it's 13 year old girls.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.360]   So I don't know.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:45.000]   More and more moms are using it though because they're girls.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.720]   Some my my hairdresser uses it and she loves the news feature on Snapchat because it doesn't
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.440]   come from anyone she knows.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.800]   And so therefore it's not imbued with any negative feelings.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.240]   Fortunately, and Snapchat is kind of snap is addressed as the news feature for a long
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.200]   time, which is pictures of Kim Kardashian's butt.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.760]   Because that is news.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.440]   Yeah, well, mostly because the companies who put the news on here, like mostly the Daily
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.000]   Mail realized, hey, if we put her butt on there, people are going to click on it.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.400]   Snapchat actually made rules just a few weeks ago to eliminate that kind of click bait.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.760]   So you see how much boring more boring this is than it used to be.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:25.800]   What we meant is Daily Mail still has something, the young woman in some sort of lingerie
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   on the front.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:31.320]   If it got really bad at one point, some there was a story.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   What was it?
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.960]   It was it was a it was a I think it was a wired story or something about guys using a technology
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:40.160]   and they had a picture of a girl in a bikini on the on the front page just to get you to
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.160]   click it.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.320]   It got out of out of control.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.080]   I see the I see the power snap, but I think what you've brought up Clayton is interesting,
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:56.440]   which is anything based on a social graph, including Facebook is very vulnerable if its
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:04.400]   users like those teenagers in Panera decide on mass to move, right?
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.400]   You go where your friends are.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.440]   I'm confused by Facebook and maybe that's why they bought WhatsApp.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.640]   That's why they bought they bought Instagram.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.640]   Facebook, you know, it's where everyone is just by mass, by volume.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   I mean, you know, I don't know.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.160]   I mean, are kids using Facebook?
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.160]   Are they even on Facebook?
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.480]   Well, that was the theory, right?
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:28.560]   Was that they're using Snapchat because it's the anti Facebook and that's and I look at
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:33.080]   my son who's 22 and is a big Snapchat user and all his friends are Snapchat users.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.880]   They don't participate in Facebook or Instagram a little bit Instagram, but mostly Snapchat
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.600]   because of it's just because it's disposable, right?
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.280]   The pictures go away.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.160]   But how is Facebook such a behemoth?
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.360]   I mean, look, when you look at their ads platform and you look what they're able to do with
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.040]   ads, it's I mean, there is no better.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.680]   I mean, it's arguably there's no better driver of traffic.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:59.360]   I mean, like we said this before, if you're a small business, you know, you're a pet store
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.400]   in a small village in a small town.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.920]   You better be on Facebook.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:07.160]   You better be on Facebook because you can do such micro targeted smart advertising just
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.720]   to pet owners who live in your zip code and who are able to then to come into your town
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.080]   and you can offer them a coupon to come in and say hello, you just open your store and
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.400]   say hello and I'd like to meet you and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.560]   You're developing that relationship with that pen owner in that town.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.560]   It's phenomenal.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.200]   I mean, there's no better way to connect with, you know, for businesses and to drive traffic
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.120]   that way than using Facebook ads.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.040]   I mean, it really is.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.000]   And then to retarget those people who were kind of like, yeah, I don't want to kind of
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.560]   go in, but maybe I would next month, retarget those people.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.800]   So I'm just curious.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.640]   I'm confused by that though.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:45.320]   If so many people are saying, hey, Facebook's not cool, then how is Facebook such a behemoth
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.120]   and continuing to see such phenomenal growth?
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.360]   >> Let's look at this.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.560]   >> That's why we were talking about Snapchat.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:55.320]   >> Let's think about Snapchat as Justin Bieber, okay?
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:01.200]   You got a huge fan following of the perfect demographic that every advertiser wants so
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.680]   that they can hook you for life.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.920]   >> Bingo, that's why Snap's hot, right?
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.960]   >> But the problem is that it's hard to know if they're going to stay with you or move
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.640]   on to the next hot artist.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   >> Very sickle.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.040]   >> Facebook is more like the label.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.120]   They are constantly trying to cultivate new stuff that's going to be hot, maybe not with
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.240]   that perfect demo, but with the bell curves.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.440]   And they're always looking to see if they can get some an up and comer because they have
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.760]   the money to do it.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.680]   >> And the fact that Facebook was able to buy Instagram and that Instagram is now eating
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:39.000]   Snapchat's lunch proves your point.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.560]   If Facebook needs to expand into an area, they can buy WhatsApp or they can buy Instagram
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.040]   and like buying an artist.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.560]   >> I'm so bearish on this.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.440]   I think this IPO is not a good bet.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.520]   And obviously, people are going to go for IPOs like this because they think there's
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.960]   a chance that they might get a 10x return even though they know that that's very, very,
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.440]   it's like your one time only chance to be a VC.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.720]   The number one reason why I'm bearish is because I don't see any opportunity for them to have
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.400]   any horizontal expansion of use.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:18.160]   So you look at what they do so well is this sense of the ephemeral, of fun, of connecting
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.960]   in the moment.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.680]   But that doesn't necessarily grow with you and it doesn't have a lot of expansion capability.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.680]   I mean, it's kind of like Disney in the feel of it.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:35.840]   And Disney's figured out how to create this huge horizontal umbrella of vertically integrated
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.040]   businesses.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.480]   I don't see anything in the core values of Snap that would create more value.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.920]   >> What about the argument that they are a camera company?
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:50.640]   We saw Snap Spectacles last year roll out and now they're going to be available, not
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   just in those little kiosks that you could have to fly to some town in Deadwood, South
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.000]   Dakota to find them.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.800]   You could actually get them more readily.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.320]   >> I actually bought mine at a premium on eBay just so I could.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.320]   >> How much did you pay for them?
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.480]   >> Actually, only 200.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.280]   So it wasn't a huge premium.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.840]   >> I just think- >> I just think-
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.160]   >> I just think- >> I'm just thinking of my dresser
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.160]   charging.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.160]   >> Yeah, I figured.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.800]   >> But it was cool to have.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.240]   I wanted, I mean, it's a part of my job is to see what is going on here.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.520]   Doesn't this remind you though, a little bit of the conversation went before Facebook
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.280]   went public and people saying, "Come on, they haven't looked mobile.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.560]   They're going to be completely disenfranchised once everybody goes to their phone."
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.400]   There was a lot of debate over whether people should buy Facebook stock.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.560]   >> What anyone would say- >> Sorry, go ahead.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:39.000]   >> No, I was just going to say the question was at the time that their ads platform, it
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   was nascent and people were wondering, "Is this really going to catch on?"
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.720]   They're going up against the beast that's Google AdWords.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.680]   Are you going to be able to slay that beast and it turns out?
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.680]   >> Yeah, they did.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.800]   >> I said at the time, if you're buying Facebook, you're betting on Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.800]   That's what you're betting on.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.560]   You're betting on that this guy will figure it out.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.480]   >> Despite Alan Kay's words to the contrary that all software companies should make their
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:08.840]   own hardware, is there a good example of an app or software company going into the hardware
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.040]   business that has been successful?
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.560]   I think of hardware as the death now.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.920]   I mean, just talk to GoPro or some of the other hardware companies, especially camera
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   companies to your point, Clayton, that have bombed.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.800]   >> Well, Amazon, that's the big counter example.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.760]   >> Yeah, they've done quite well with Echo and tablets.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.760]   >> Good point.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760]   >> Not the fire phone.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.240]   Microsoft went from being a software company to being a software and hardware company.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.600]   And then it's core Snapchat is a camera app.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.640]   >> You're not saying a physical camera, you're saying the app.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.640]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.640]   And we see spectacles as sort of like a whimsical play on that idea of the app.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:50.960]   But this idea that the Snapchat camera filter could pop up in the Facebook app that, oh,
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.360]   you want to take a snap inside your Facebook app as a feature.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.400]   I mean, that's where I could see it going, but I don't see it to your point, Becky.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.600]   I don't see it expanding across horizons.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.960]   We're going to have a Snapchat style home theater device that we're going to be able to say,
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.240]   hey, snap, what's the weather today?
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.120]   I'm going to get some answers and it's going to be open my garage door.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   I don't know.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.120]   >> I don't even- >> I like what you said, Becky.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.640]   >> Were you still able to grow with the audience?
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:25.120]   I don't see a 39 year old mom in 20 years sending a snap to her PTA friend like, why
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   now, bitches?
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.120]   I don't see that happening.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.400]   >> I think you made the right point, which is that you compared it to labels and artists,
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:39.880]   but I'd say platform versus apps, the Facebook's a platform and that Snapchat's just an app.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.680]   And yet, just as when I said, if you're investing in Facebook stock, you're investing in Mark
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.120]   Zuckerberg, you could say you're investing in Evan Spiegel, the founder of Snap.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:56.320]   This guy has shown that he knows how to at least reach that very valuable demographic.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.360]   >> When I turn the conversation to Mark Zuckerberg's letter and manifesto-
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.280]   >> We can do that in a moment, yes.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.800]   >> I'm interested in your thoughts.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.240]   >> Yeah, I would love to- >> I want to hear what you think.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.000]   >> David, before we move on, would you- I mean, look, first of all, anybody take stock advice
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.760]   from us is nuts.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.080]   That's given, and I don't know about you, but I don't buy tech stocks because I don't
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.240]   want to have an investment in any of these companies.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.160]   But give us some advice.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.080]   Would you buy Snapstock?
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:33.040]   >> I wouldn't, and I would argue that the entire premise of our conversation here today is,
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.800]   there's this business insider guy saying, I've stopped using it, and I know this is anecdotal.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.440]   Yes, it's anecdotal.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   >> Right.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.920]   >> The whole argument is ridiculous.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.680]   And even with all due respect, I saw some people in Panera Bread not using it.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.720]   That's not a real-
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.160]   >> Well, there are numbers though.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.160]   There are numbers.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:57.320]   I hang out in Panera Bread every day with a clipboard.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:04.360]   >> There are numbers that show that Instagram has, in fact, taken a lot of business from
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.840]   Snapchat, right?
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.840]   >> Right.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.680]   >> Snapchat growth slowed 82% after Instagram stories launched.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.800]   >> So I think that's a far more telling data point, and for that reason, I wouldn't invest.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.360]   I just, oh, yeah, you can see it slowing down there.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   There you go.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.840]   I just can't see this thing being around in 10 years or five years.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.840]   It's a one-trick pony.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.880]   >> I have to say, when I saw Instagram stories, I thought, well, that's a Snapchat ripoff.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.240]   Why would anybody do that?
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:36.480]   But I don't understand really what's going on about the migration to Instagram.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.800]   I do not understand that.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:43.240]   I don't think it's as appealing as it looks like an old person's app compared to Snap,
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.640]   which was felt like a kids app, you know, a fun app.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   >> I would argue that-
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.520]   >> Does it play in Peoria has become, does it play at Panera?
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.520]   >> Yes.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.840]   >> That's the new, especially in New Jersey, right, Clayton?
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840]   >> That's right.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.160]   >> Oh, we get Panera everywhere.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.680]   Panera is a very good measure.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:06.640]   >> I did an explainer for Yahoo Finance a couple months ago on Snapchat for those who
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.240]   don't know what it is, which is most people.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.400]   And there's a lot of psychology to it that, again, limits it to this particular age and
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.720]   gender bracket.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:23.200]   For example, Leo, you were pointing out how opaque it is, how hard it is, how nonintuitive.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.040]   And I actually think that's part of it.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.040]   >> I agree.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:31.480]   >> Like teens and pre-teens want something that their parents can't use and won't understand.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:37.840]   And in terms of the large female teenager thing, it's been argued that that's because women,
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:43.960]   girls, are so constantly judged today for their looks, for their behavior, for their
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:50.280]   clothing, that something that lets you send an unfiltered snap of yourself, where it's
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.080]   not going to come back to haunt you, it's not going to be judged, is this huge psychological
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.120]   burden lifted.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.200]   And again, though, that's kind of unique to, I mean, not solely unique, but that's a lot
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.120]   of teenage girls who feel that way.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.720]   >> Well, the opaqueness, you're right about that.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.400]   It's like the opaqueness is what we saw in iOS 10 with the Messages app.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.840]   I mean, try to navigate that if you're my mom.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.840]   You're not going to be able to do it.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.680]   But if you're a teenage girl, you're going to be able to find all these hidden things
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.840]   inside the Messages app on purpose.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.680]   Look at Pokemon Go.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.000]   It's pretty opaque and you're trying to find and navigate through that to try to figure
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.520]   out different menu and sub menus.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.200]   And it's part of the fun of the hunting and pecking of that game.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.640]   I wouldn't be surprised in a future version of iOS.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:42.600]   We see a self-destructing photo feature that, you know, Sherlock's the idea of the disappearing
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.840]   photo from Snapchat.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:52.680]   >> There's a word, affordance, that user interface design people use.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.840]   That is, an affordance is a capability of an object.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.720]   Like you look at a doorknob and you can kind of intuit that it turns.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.760]   And, you know, you could push a push plate and you pull a handle.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.800]   There's certain information you gather from looking at it.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:12.800]   And of course, Snapchat and more recently, Apple's Messages have all these hidden features.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.920]   And I'm of the opinion, it's intentional that these hidden affordances are actually
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:25.480]   a social tool because they encourage people to share, look, I figured out how to do this
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.840]   and show other people.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.920]   And it actually helps their word of mouth.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:33.360]   I think Snapchat almost proved that by being completely opaque.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.000]   Yeah, it hit it from parents.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.200]   And you know, there was an in-group who understood it and an out-group who didn't.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.920]   And then people who were in the out-group and didn't understand it.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.960]   But were buddies with people who did wanted to be in the in-group.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:51.200]   So the buddies got some social reputation by saying, oh, I know how to do that, watch
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   you do that.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   And then you're in the in-group.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.440]   And I think that was part of how it spread.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:02.920]   But I also think that Apple saw this and said, we should probably put some hidden affordances
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.400]   in messages and see if the same thing can happen.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.720]   And I don't know if it did, but I do have to admit, I've spent a lot of time with my 83
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.800]   year old mother showing her how to make balloons appear on an Apple message.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.200]   When you do that, see what happens when you do that, you send a message to somebody and
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.400]   they get the confetti or the fireworks or the laser show.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.600]   The first question is, how'd you do that?
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.600]   How'd you do that?
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.600]   Exactly.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.200]   And you get some social currency by saying, oh, well, I'll show you.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.800]   Well, I certainly hope you're wrong.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.720]   I mean, Apple's whole thing has been--
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.720]   I know.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   It's history.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:39.880]   It's a scream toward user interface, simplicity, clear away the hidden crap.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.880]   I mean, this would be a radical change.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.880]   But it is.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   But don't you think David Apple's going through exactly that?
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   Well, I'm not--
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.400]   It's opposite day in Cupertino.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.120]   The question is, is it intentional?
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.520]   I mean, Apple music when it came out.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.520]   Well, that's just crappy.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.520]   It's a disaster.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520]   It's just crappy.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.520]   I don't think that's intentional.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.520]   The seeming child.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.520]   And what did they do?
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.520]   Did that make it popular?
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.520]   No.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.520]   Did that make it--
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520]   Bad design.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.760]   That was just bad design.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.240]   I think messages--
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.120]   I think messages clearly with these hidden features was a play to--
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.840]   I think they tried to do it exactly.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.840]   But I mean, it's hard to say.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.680]   I think that they're both things were at play.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.840]   Apple music was just bad.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.600]   And I think messages is not bad.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.920]   This is an attempt to try this, especially because it's so closely related to Snapchat.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.640]   I mean, it's in the same field and that kind of thing.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.480]   But why would you assume that one is just clueless?
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   Well, because Apple music--
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.480]   Well, the music--
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.760]   There's no social cred to be gained by saying, "I know how to use that feature," and showing
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.280]   somebody.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.560]   You just stop using the thing.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.480]   You say, "I can't-- this is a piece of crap."
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.000]   Well, and also, iMessages is the number one app on the iPhone.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   Right.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.080]   It's used more than any other app by a landslide on the iPhone.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:56.120]   It's not a mistake that they made it this interesting and this complex and multi-layered.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.440]   David, you and I are original Apple fans.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.320]   I mean, this is how you got in the business, right?
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:06.240]   It's showing composers how to use Apple computers, Macintosh, right?
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.280]   We've been Apple guys from way, way back.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.080]   And it's a very different company than it was the company that we fell in love with,
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.640]   the computer for the rest of us.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.200]   It's not even recognizable.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.200]   No.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:23.040]   I do this series of 30 second tip videos for Yahoo Finance called POGS Basics.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:31.040]   And one of the most popular ones was how to hang up a call on the iPhone.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.360]   I see the green bar.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.560]   I know I'm in a call.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.680]   But they've, and I was, and they've taken away the hang up button.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.760]   The red X is gone.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.920]   So what happens is you're on a phone call.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.720]   After a certain point, the screen goes dark.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.480]   And once it's dark, the hang up button is gone when you wake it.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.480]   It's so crazy.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:57.680]   So you have to know to tap the name of the persons and then unlock it.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.680]   And then you can hit the hang up button.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.760]   I've got to watch your videos because I don't know.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.880]   I just basically, I put the phone aside and hope the other person will hang up.
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880]   Okay.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.880]   Just listening to you.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.880]   That's how I have.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.640]   If they don't hang up right away, I start singing out of key.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   That usually does.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.600]   Well, what happens is you happen to want you to buy AirPods.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.760]   So you just double tap on the AirPod.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.040]   Actually, I found a tip for hanging up an iPhone called.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.480]   Do you think anyone wants to know?
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.040]   Yes, please hit the sleep switch.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.000]   It makes it go dark and hangs up.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   Oh, that's clever.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   That's nice.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:29.960]   But they don't tell you that.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   They don't tell you that.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.000]   So there, I think that's bad design, not the magic of hidden affordances.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.040]   Yeah, that's as bad design.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:45.560]   Let's talk about Mark and his 6,800 word Facebook, the Unabomber Manifesto as written
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.040]   by Mark Zuckerberg and what it all means.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040]   Because there's some interesting.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]   Did we talk about this last week?
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.040]   Like we've talked about.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.040]   I think not.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.760]   Ben Thompson from Stratecary had a very interesting take on it.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:04.720]   Others have said this is Mark's first salvo and is run for president for 2020.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.720]   What does it all mean?
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:06.720]   Becky wants to talk about it.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.040]   Becky gets whatever she wants.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.160]   Oh, I like this show even more.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.160]   Greatest.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.320]   Becky Worley from Good Morning America, my old friend.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.480]   We worked together at Tech TV for many years.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.200]   And it's always wonderful to have you on.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.120]   Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends, another great old dear friend.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.560]   And of course married to another great old dear friend.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.640]   Well, she probably wouldn't want me to call her old Natalie Morris.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.280]   It's great to have you on.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.600]   And you'll have to at some point explain your four foot tall stormtrooper behind you.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.160]   It's a little scary.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.800]   He's here to watch and make sure that I don't go off the rails.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.000]   Oh, did you get that at Toy Fair?
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   That is awesome.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   No, my buddy.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.920]   I thought he was thinking of a Christmas present to get me.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.160]   And so he had ordered me a water pick for some reason.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.040]   I don't know if you thought I had like beans in my teeth.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.520]   And I said, what did you order me a water pick for?
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.360]   And then suddenly these huge boxes show up at the house the one day.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.440]   And he's like, I want to get you something fun.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.640]   And these are not for the kids, by the way.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.240]   And they're like four and a half foot tall Star Wars figure.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.000]   So the stormtrooper?
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.280]   There's more than one.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.880]   I have a there's a Darth Vader that I put up in my son's room to keep him.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.080]   Make sure he goes to sleep on time.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.280]   He's at that nightmares.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:20.720]   Yeah, we just we put them strategically around the house to scare off vagrants and robbers.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.000]   But he also sent you a water pick.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.680]   No, he returned the water pick.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.560]   Oh, it is a play.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560]   Let's talk about ginger vites.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.160]   When I'm out of town, I'm going to have him sit at my computer so people when they look
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.000]   through the window, they think that someone's home.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   That's pretty funny.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.160]   That's a good deal.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.280]   I would take I would you know, you can send me a water pick if you feel bad about it and
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.280]   give me Darth Vader later.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.280]   That's great.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.200]   That's awesome.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:48.240]   So another great friend, David Pogue, known him for years.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.400]   The great tech writer.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:52.240]   He's got the new missing manual, OS 10 Sierra, Mac OS.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.800]   I guess you have to call it Mac OS now Mac OS Sierra.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:01.720]   And of course, Pogues Basics, which is a series of books that help you live life better.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.320]   And you see him at Yahoo Finance in the tech sections, tech editor for Yahoo Finance.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.440]   When you were last time you were on, you had a new you have Pogues Basics, which is the
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.440]   newest one.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.240]   The newest one is money.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.520]   Two 200 loopholes in life and society that let you pay less for things.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.320]   So you've done tech, you've done life.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.320]   What was it?
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.320]   Wow, look at all those stars.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.320]   Wow.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.240]   Look at that four and a half star 60 customer reviews.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:31.560]   I didn't know much about life and I certainly didn't know much about money until I read
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.320]   David Pogues Basics.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.320]   That's awesome.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.480]   That's fantastic.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.760]   And we are glad all three of you are here.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.120]   You make Twit worth living.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.120]   Our show.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.120]   Leon, concert.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.880]   No, I know that sounded really dark.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.040]   Is that a leaf for hell?
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040]   It was really dark.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:55.680]   You should be out of your slogans more on Uber, I think.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.920]   When you drunk at 1 a.m., what else are you going to do?
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.840]   But listen to Twit.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.000]   We will have more in a moment.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.160]   I show today brought to you by my web host.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.240]   They do my site, leoleport.com.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240]   They do so many people's sites.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.720]   That's what I'm talking of course about.
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.720]   Squarespace.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.720]   Squarespace is the best place to create your next thing.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.560]   It's never too late to reinvent yourself, change careers, launch a creative project.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:23.320]   Make your next move known to the world with Squarespace.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:28.720]   The best hosting plus the best templates to give you a site that looks like you're a
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.800]   web wizard.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.920]   You don't have to know any HTML or CSS.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.400]   You just take a template.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.040]   You've got the best engineering, the best designers.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.000]   By the way, if you are a designer, if you're a developer, Squarespace is a great platform
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   for you too.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   They've got a developer platform.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   You just check a box.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.200]   You have access to all the code you can modify.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:51.640]   You start with a great template and you can enhance it.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.000]   Select a template that fits your vision.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.600]   Actually, I'll tell you what, go right now to Squarespace.com.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.040]   Click that Get Started button and you can start designing a site right now at no cost.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.200]   Pick a template.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.120]   You've got some really nice new style grid templates.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.600]   They've got full bleed image templates.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:15.120]   If you're a photographer, for instance, and you want your images to sing a great portfolio,
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.560]   every Squarespace site though has commerce built in, which is awesome.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:23.360]   In fact, the only platform I know of that will let you create, manage, and brand an online
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:29.240]   store that doesn't look like just something an afterthought hanging off of your site.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.720]   It has the same design as your site.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.560]   It fits in and integrated beautifully into your site.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.560]   But you have all these nice features including Squarespace Analytics.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.840]   You can, with visual, beautiful visual reports that let you keep track of page views and
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.240]   conversions and popular content.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:49.200]   Immediately, the minute you press the button to set up the store, you can start taking credit
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.240]   cards, PayPal and Apple Pay.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.960]   They integrate with MailChimp as well as many others things.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.920]   If you want to do an email campaign or a newsletter, that's easy.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.680]   Calendar, lists of events, you can take RSVPs right from the site.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.040]   It's the most powerful, most sophisticated site.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:10.080]   RSS is built in too, of course, so you can publish directly from your blog.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.640]   Be great for a podcast for that matter.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:15.520]   Update your content once and you share it across all your social media platforms.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.880]   Not only that, but your visitors can do the same.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.880]   Share and pin it buttons.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.440]   Let them share your content to their followers.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.440]   Pursue your passion.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.120]   Make your next move with Squarespace.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.560]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.560]   Try it for free, but if you decide to buy, don't forget to use TWIT as the offer code
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.120]   because you'll get 10% off.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:40.040]   That's squarespace.com and the offer code TWIT.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.360]   I should show you Leo Laport.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.480]   I think, maybe Becker is in what?
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.680]   I have a slideshow to be at the front page of images.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.040]   I'm going to add you three to my slideshows.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.840]   I want that one of us when you're dressed up as a sumo suit.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.440]   Oh, yeah, at the party.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.440]   I like that one of us.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.440]   We had some wild times.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:01.440]   That was old school.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.320]   Yeah, that was a fun party.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.320]   One of many.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:10.080]   So did you actually read Mark Zuckerberg's 6,000 word piece?
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.760]   No, I read pieces of it, but I...
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.760]   It's five.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.680]   Yeah, tell me what...
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.800]   I know you said you fell off the cliff with it.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:25.760]   Well, you start reading it and your initial reaction, at least my initial reaction is...
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.120]   This is just a bunch of business-y gobbledygook.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:40.200]   But a number of people swayed me into thinking, "This is almost a global power grab from Mark
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200]   Zuckerberg.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.600]   Here's an article by John Jandasen and Rico.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:50.080]   Mark Zuckerberg wants Facebook to have more power in our lives and we should resist."
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:56.320]   The one that was most dramatic was Ben Thompson's article in Stratecary.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:03.120]   He addressed directly the rumor that Mark might be interested in politics in a presidential
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:09.240]   run saying, "Why would Mark Zuckerberg, almost entirely..."
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:14.720]   He says, "Mark owns Facebook and Facebook owns a social graph.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.200]   Given this reality, why would Zuckerberg want to be president?"
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:23.760]   He's not only the CEO of Facebook, he's the dominant shareholder, answerable to no one.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:28.640]   His power and ability to influence is greater than any president subject to political reality
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.200]   and checks and balances.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:35.240]   And besides, as Zuckerberg made clear last week, his concern is not mere country, but
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.840]   rather the entire world.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.000]   I disagree with you.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.720]   I don't think he is unanswerable to no one.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:48.040]   I think this is the heart of what this is about.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:52.960]   Facebook sent me a summary that they approved for what this letter was about in case people
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.800]   like us couldn't explain it.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.680]   The cliff notes, yeah.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:01.560]   The most important, these are the two points that I think are really interested.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.080]   For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:09.520]   With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.400]   a connected global community.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.080]   Up until today, Facebook has focused on, oh, it's the same thing.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.080]   It said it twice.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.080]   They felt so strongly about it.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.080]   Sorry.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.080]   Did you read that for a second?
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.080]   Let me say it again.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.480]   So my point about he answers to no one who he answers to, Priscilla Chan.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.600]   His wife.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.200]   And this is a man.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.160]   Did you ever see the video of him speaking Chinese?
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   Yeah, he learned Mandarin.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.320]   You don't do that lightly.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.800]   No.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.840]   And I don't think that's just a we got to get into China and we really want to be in
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.000]   China because it's a good business decision.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.120]   I think that this is the complete 180 view of the world from Donald Trump.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.880]   This is so not nationalistic.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.880]   It's so good.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.280]   This is a response to Trump.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.760]   It's a complete response.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760]   Yep.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.920]   And in that SEC filing, you saw too back that was if was it from April buried in that
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:09.000]   SEC filing was that he has the ability that if he had to leave a leave of absence from
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.840]   Facebook, that if it would not constitute a voluntary resignation, if it were in connection
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.520]   with him running for public office.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:22.200]   Furthermore, he can serve in government and still run Facebook, this filing said.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.680]   So they restructured as part of the restructure.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:30.960]   They restructured how the rules of work for Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.920]   So it does indicate I think, you know, and he's also on a 50 state tour, right?
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.080]   You saw the pictures of him in Alabama, right?
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.480]   How do you guys think he would be his president?
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.480]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.400]   You have to be a dynamic speaker.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.400]   And I think he's been that's also interesting.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.520]   If you can learn Mandarin, you can learn to give a speech.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.520]   Right.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.520]   And what I mean, my point is he used to be awful at it.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.280]   Yeah, he's not awful anymore.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.720]   And he's gotten a lot.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:55.720]   He's gotten a lot better.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.680]   I mean, he's nowhere nearly as bad as Elon Musk giving a speech.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:02.520]   Do you see Elon Musk giving a speech for the unveiling of the solar panels?
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520]   That was awful.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.520]   It was maybe one of the worst speeches I've ever seen.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.480]   You have opposite reactions to public speaking.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:13.280]   Do you remember the the recode, the all things D when Mark was just sweating profusely?
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.280]   But that was the old Mark.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.520]   Elon's like, he goes narcoleptic.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520]   Right.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.880]   I mean, he speaks with the most bored tone about the most ridiculously insane things.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.640]   It's so it's so disoriented.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.400]   He's like, we just we just landed on Mars.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.720]   I just want to let everyone know.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.480]   You know, I know a lot of people.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.480]   Tell a lot of people who think who love that.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.720]   Because they find it refreshing and authentic.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:45.480]   And one thing you do get from a lot of keynote speakers and CEOs is this phony rah, rah,
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:51.840]   you know, just just, you know, do a extract of Apple keynotes and all the superlatives.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.640]   And it after a while you start it just starts to go, you know, come on guys, just be normal.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:03.080]   But I think we're quickly learning that bad and talent free might be refreshing.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.080]   Yes.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.680]   So bad and talent free.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.680]   Well, yeah.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:07.680]   Okay.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.680]   It's authentic.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:09.680]   Authenticity is the coin of the realm right now.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.680]   I do say so.
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.760]   I mean, you can no one could argue that Donald Trump is an eloquent public speaker.
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:21.280]   But there's something about his ability to speak that connects with people very clearly.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.680]   That eloquent is not the word.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:24.320]   It's not eloquent.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.360]   But nevertheless, it's authentic and it's impactful.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:33.280]   And it's and I would argue it's persuasive to some anyway.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.680]   That's the end game though for him.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:37.600]   I'm trying to wrap my head around what would be the purpose.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.800]   Well, I do agree with Ben that why would he want to be a president?
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.280]   That's a very, that's a job, you know, that is considerably a step down.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.640]   That's very limited.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.640]   It's limited.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.040]   It's a very limited role.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:56.080]   And as even President Trump is now experiencing with, you know, for his first 100 days, whether
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.760]   or not he's going to be able to get tax reform through and these sort of marginalized Republican
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.800]   candidates in certain districts are feeling squeezed about Obamacare.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.160]   You have to be answerable to that.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.520]   So it's not going to be as clear sailing as anyone thinks it is when you just have all
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.520]   this power.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:09.520]   You have a large.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.480]   Don't you have to be 18 to run for president?
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.480]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:14.480]   Zuckerberg just passed.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:22.080]   He got to be 35, but just passes the constitutional requirement in August of 2019.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080]   Oh, man.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:27.440]   Or 2020, I guess it's of 2020, which would be the filing deadline for a presidential
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.640]   run in November.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.040]   So he can squeak in under the wire.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.520]   He'd be the youngest candidate or one of the youngest candidates, if not the youngest
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.520]   candidate ever.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.760]   Ted Cruz was Canadian.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:37.760]   He ran.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.760]   There you go.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.720]   Obama was Kenyan.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.360]   So you know, it's possible.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:49.280]   No, you guys have Facebook fans fan pages or pages where you, you know, ignore it.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.280]   I have it.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.520]   Have you ever looked at the metrics of where your people are from?
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.520]   No, I should.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.520]   Okay.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.480]   I'm going to give you a little quiz.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.720]   So 5,000 likes on Facebook.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:02.720]   Where do you think my number?
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.400]   Give me my top two or three cities where people are coming from.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.240]   Yes, Louisville, Kentucky.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.240]   Okay.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.240]   Good guess.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.240]   Good morning, America.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.240]   That's me.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240]   Where else, Leo?
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.080]   I would say St. Louis, Missouri.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   Okay.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.080]   Dayton, Ohio.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.080]   We're talking about any guesses.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.800]   It's going to be in the middle of America.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.320]   It's going to be Des Moines.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.320]   Here we go.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320]   Top 10.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.320]   Singapore.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.320]   What?
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.320]   Kazon city.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.320]   What?
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.320]   Metro Manila.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.320]   Dubai.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.320]   Karachi, Pakistan.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320]   No, come on.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   That's been sold.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.320]   Manila.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]   New York City is number six.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   Those are all bots.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320]   Those are all bots.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   Maybe.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320]   Manila again.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.320]   Riyadh, Jakarta.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320]   What the what?
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.320]   How's that?
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320]   You're you finding this info?
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.480]   Oh, by the way.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.560]   If you go to insights and people.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:57.920]   You get a lot of insight.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:04.280]   I don't know how fair it is to use mine because I don't really cultivate these.
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:08.400]   I've spent a lot more time on this lately than Twitter because I feel like I get so much
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.360]   more and there's so much more diversity in the type of material that you can publish.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.000]   My fan base is predictable in terms of countries.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.640]   US, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, English, language countries.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.640]   Number one, Los Angeles.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:22.880]   That's because of the radio show.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   Number two, New York.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.000]   Number three, San Jose, San Diego.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.280]   See how much more I don't know.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.720]   Something's going on with your stuff.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.880]   Well, I do a lot of tips and tricks like sounded bad, but.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.880]   And I love tricks in.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.880]   Don't do the tricks for tips.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:45.040]   Oh, but you know, like just my most.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.560]   I can worry is our private dancer.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.560]   I love it.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.760]   Oh, it sounded bad.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:57.080]   But I have a little high blue video is about Excel.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.760]   How to manipulate an Excel spreadsheet.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.080]   I know if I'm looking at a work Excel, I go to Good Morning America.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.080]   That's absolutely.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.080]   That's interesting.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.080]   I don't know.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.880]   I mean, if I use this more, I would certainly pay attention to it.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.720]   I guess my point is that the global business is the Facebook business.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:18.720]   Not just this world.
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:26.400]   That's about Zuckerberg's note is, you know, on one hand, it was an anti-Trump cry where
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400]   all people were one planet.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.720]   We're all just together in this.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.920]   And on the other hand, that fits very nicely with Facebook's master business plan.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.920]   Right.
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.480]   Of course, they want no barriers.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:39.480]   Right.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:45.400]   I looked and I couldn't quite figure out what he was trying to say.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.240]   I mean, not, you know, what the underlying motivation was there.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:53.240]   I wasn't, it wasn't clear to me.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:58.240]   And you know, I mean, he went from a one sentence mission statement to his 5,800 word mission
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.080]   statement that wasn't completely clear.
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.840]   So Apple is going to.
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.480]   Too many words to get elected.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.480]   That's for sure.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.480]   He's going to have to, he's going to have to whittle that down to three words.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.720]   Well, he's a slogan, you know, make Facebook great again.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:15.720]   I don't know.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:18.640]   I'm calling the man when you're drunk.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.000]   Oh, give a piece of chance.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.840]   Apple has announced that it's going to open the new campus in April.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.720]   They're going to start moving in employees.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.760]   It's going to take them a long time.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.600]   12,000 people will be moved in over six months.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.600]   And it's not done.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:40.240]   They're still going to be working on buildings and parklands.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:46.840]   This is the amazing spaceship, Cafford's 2.8 million square foot main building in Clad
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:50.560]   and the world's largest panels of curved glass.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:55.320]   This is the theater, which is where you guys will all go when you get invitations to Apple
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:59.760]   events, which you won't know that I'm jealous or anything.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.200]   Not that somebody else here didn't get banned because of you.
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.800]   Yeah, you got banned because of me, right?
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.360]   I got banned because of you.
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.240]   But that was, that was a story.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.800]   He jumps Steve Jobs.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.880]   And I don't know somehow he jumped you.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.600]   Again, this is wrong.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.600]   Exactly.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.600]   Here it is.
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.600]   Tips and tricks.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:24.640]   No, I was FaceTiming with Leo from the magic room, you know, the place where you go look
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.680]   at the new stuff afterwards.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:32.000]   I either call it the champagne room or the magic room, both after looking at it.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.560]   But I was FaceTiming Leo from there and Steve Jobs came up to me and was asking what I was
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:41.200]   doing and didn't realize that I was basically live casting.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.080]   So he came up to you?
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.520]   He came up to me.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:45.960]   I didn't realize that.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:52.200]   And then you asked him, when are you going to open up FaceTime like you promised?
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.200]   That didn't go over well.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.560]   And that's when you got talked to the hand.
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:59.280]   But you haven't been invited to an Apple event since then?
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.080]   No, they're still mad.
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.080]   Wow.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:03.080]   They hold.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.440]   I plan to and maybe you can help you guys can help me because I know Clayton goes and
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.400]   I absolutely know David goes.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:12.600]   I plan to get on my knees and beg Katie Cotton or actually she's not there anymore.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:17.440]   I have to figure out whoever's there and say, please, I just want to go to the first event
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.000]   at this new place.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.720]   There's a thousand seats.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.400]   It's bigger than the old Apple event auditorium.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.040]   That was only about half the size.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.760]   They could have a journalist amnesty program.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.720]   I need a little amnesty.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.960]   Just need a little amnesty.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.120]   You just go to Guantanamo Bay for the year.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.120]   Whatever it takes.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.120]   I will do a little stay time.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:42.480]   If you want me to crawl on my hands and knees to Cooper Tino from here and anything, whatever
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:43.600]   it takes, I would really like to.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.600]   We were wrong.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.600]   Apple was right.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.600]   We were wrong.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.600]   Apple was right.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:48.600]   That's right.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.400]   I think I'm going to have there it is.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.200]   This is Becky Worley.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.200]   Oh my God.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.200]   I like it Steve.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.200]   Steve's making the rounds.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:59.360]   I'm talking to the people.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:05.120]   This was our special, by the way, a first for us, a FaceTime call to the Apple campus.
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.840]   Yeah, he was.
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:12.360]   It's funny they're going to name the theater at the new facility after him, which I think
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.360]   appropriate.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.360]   Yeah, I think that's nice.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.360]   So long time.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.360]   It could be 62 next week.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.360]   Is that right?
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360]   I read that.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.360]   That's crazy.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.360]   February 24th.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:28.080]   So they're naming the Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:32.200]   It's a top of a hill with one of the highest points within Apple Park, by the way, is what
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.720]   they're calling this new complex overlooking meadows in the main building.
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.120]   And that's a carbon fiber roof, one giant piece.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.120]   Wow.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.360]   Yeah, they plopped it on top.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.640]   It's kind of, yeah.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.560]   This is, I mean, this is, in some ways, Steve's last creation.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:54.440]   Shortly before he died, he went to the Cupertino City Council to plead to get the permits to
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.440]   do it.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.840]   And he was had a big hand in the design of it along with Johnny Ivan.
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.240]   I think it's very appropriate.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.240]   It's beautiful.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:04.720]   Part of the pros and cons of that design, though, a giant ring.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.320]   I mean, like if the person you're supposed to have a meeting with, you're at 12 o'clock
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.080]   and there are six o'clock.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.800]   I mean, is there a shuttle bus?
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:17.800]   Clearly these people have never been to an airport because that does not work in any
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:18.800]   airport I've ever been to.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.560]   Walter Isaacson in the biography says in the initial design, Steve had one bathroom in
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.240]   the whole place because he wanted everybody to meet.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:32.240]   And he wanted a lot of cross-pollination as people walked a mile over to the bathroom.
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.240]   This is straight out of hidden figures, isn't it?
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.240]   Thank you, Eric.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:40.880]   Somebody talked Steve out of that.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:46.000]   You know, I've talked to also some of the builders involved in this and there have been
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.720]   problems with expansion, heat expansion, causing some of these plate glass windows to
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.720]   break.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.920]   They're very expensive, tens of thousands of dollars for each panel and they don't make
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.920]   them one at a time.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.240]   They have to make them in a batch.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:06.280]   So one breaks, that means a half million dollar batch of panels has to be made to replace
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.280]   that one.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.720]   And they lost, I was told by this builder quite a few.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.920]   So it's ambitious, right?
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.800]   But it will be, I love this, 100% solar.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:20.760]   They've got 17 megawatts of solar panels on the roof.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.880]   The whole roof is covered with solar panels.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.000]   And because it's a ring shape, when there's no drainage, when it fills up in the middle
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   with water.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   The other pool.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.160]   They have a pool and an aquarium, which is fantastic.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.160]   And the dolphins will be so happy.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:40.720]   Of course, the other advantage is that when North Korea starts the nuclear war with us,
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:45.840]   everyone who works at Apple will just get in the ring and it'll go, "I hope so.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.960]   We're going to Mars, kids."
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:54.320]   People putting a lot of energy into some new Seattle offices as well.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.000]   And this is kind of interesting.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.080]   These are the offices focused on AI and machine learning.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.160]   And they've got ties to the University of Washington there, where there's a very good
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.360]   program.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:12.480]   They've endowed a million dollar professorship that was made possible by Apple's acquisition
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:14.600]   of Seattle-based machine learning startup Torey.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.360]   It'll give the University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering Department a chance
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.600]   to attract more top talent.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.600]   That's what you do, right?
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:28.080]   If you're going to build a team, you get the nearest university to create a program so
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.880]   you can draw people in, the best and the brightest.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.440]   That's long.
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.920]   Let's talk about long-term thinking.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.000]   It was long-term thinking to build this building.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.520]   But that's how long-term their thinking is.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.520]   We're going to grow our own.
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:46.840]   Do you think they're doing that to poach from Amazon?
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.840]   That's interesting.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.840]   I don't know.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:51.000]   Why else would you go to UW?
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.040]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:56.040]   Amazon or maybe Microsoft?
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.040]   Maybe.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.440]   The thrust of this is AI, right?
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:06.640]   Yeah, not AR, which of course, AR is where Microsoft has a strong lead with its HoloLens.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:11.280]   Yeah, Apple is, I mean, if I were them, I would be sweating AI.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.080]   That's probably what's really behind this.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.520]   I mean, they missed the Amazon Echo boat.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.560]   They've got nothing like that.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.720]   Their series falling farther and farther behind.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.120]   It's not extensible like the Amazon Echo is.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.680]   They abandoned their self-driving car thing.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:30.720]   I mean, Apple should have been on top of AI.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.720]   They have so much cash that you'd think that they could just throw money at these kinds
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.720]   of problems.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:39.240]   But I think it's hard to get the brains.
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.320]   And if you're your top AI researcher, where are you going to go?
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:46.360]   Are you going to go to Apple or are you going to go to Google or are you going to go to
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.360]   Amazon?
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.360]   Google.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.360]   Google, right?
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360]   Did I get that?
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.360]   Yes.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.360]   Apple kind of cracked on.
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.720]   Apple kind of crapped on machine learning with the rollout of Apple music.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.920]   They made a number of statements.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:05.200]   That was Jimmy Iovine.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.280]   True.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:10.560]   But there was this push to where they saw Google going.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:15.480]   And where they saw the ability to do people or human curation.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:19.840]   Even before they bought Beats, one of the things about Beats music, Iovine made a big deal
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.080]   about it is it's human curated.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.960]   It's human curated.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:29.360]   So I think that was Iovine speaking basically once Apple acquired them saying, we're going
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.360]   to do human curation.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.600]   And I think actually that works.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:39.760]   I mean, look at compare Apple music's choices to say Pandora, which is all machine based.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:47.200]   I don't think Apple's missed the boat on the connected home, that device in the kitchen
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:51.440]   that can tell you when your eggs are done or the forecast for tomorrow.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.480]   I think there's a long way to go.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:58.720]   And I think Apple does what Apple does, which is sit back and watch these companies try that.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:03.440]   I mean, I think there's a space for something with a screen in that environment.
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:08.200]   How many times do you wish that your echo had some sort of a screen on it that you could
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:12.000]   interact with or the Google home for that matter?
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.360]   Instead of having to go back to square one, there's a way to work with it.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:18.640]   Yeah, Siri has been woefully behind in certain ways.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:24.040]   And the speakers that are on our Apple devices don't kick on unless I have it right up to
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:27.120]   my face to be able to get answers to it.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.080]   But I think there's still a lot of room for growth there.
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.400]   I don't think Apple's that far behind.
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:37.200]   If they put their strength behind that bat, they could hit a home run pretty quickly.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:45.720]   I think the genius of the echo and the Google home is no screen is that it's ambient.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.720]   It's over there.
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.920]   It's your whole house listening.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:54.480]   The home kitchen appliance thing has been tried and died thousands of times.
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.080]   The three-com Audrey.
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.080]   Remember that?
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.080]   That was it.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.080]   The kitchen tablets.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.480]   Nobody ever wanted that.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.160]   If you want that, we have a laptop or an iPad.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.160]   No, this is the idea that wherever you are, hey, make it two degrees warmer in here.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.600]   I mean, that's magic, not going over and tapping something.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:15.600]   You could make the case.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.240]   No, no, and I don't mean tapping it, but being able to see results in a way.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:25.080]   I mean, I'm sure that this is on the R&D floor at a Cupertino now, of course, right?
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.280]   So how is that interaction?
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:29.680]   How are those experiences playing out?
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.080]   Do you want to have your hands covered in something?
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.760]   I was cooking something the other day.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.160]   I wanted that recipe that I had saved in Epicurious a while ago, right?
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.160]   I don't want to have to tap for it, but wouldn't it be great if that device was able to bring
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:47.120]   up that recipe right before me, right there on that screen, but could also be playing
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.240]   music and have it count down timer.
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.000]   There is a need for those types of things.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.560]   I think Apple probably is testing it.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.560]   I'm sure Amazon is probably testing it as well.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.320]   We don't know until we get our hands on it, right?
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:03.080]   You could actually do that on your Mac laptop now.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:08.960]   You can say, "Call up the Epicurious document called Marinated Flankstake that I had open
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.960]   last week."
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:10.960]   Really?
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:11.960]   I didn't know that.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:13.960]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.440]   You got to read Mac OSCR, the missing manual.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.280]   I got to read that.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:23.200]   No, I think it's not that Apple's missed the boat, but the boat is at the dock.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.760]   The engines are revved up.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.200]   It's about to sail.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.560]   What we don't know is what Apple's got hidden away in its labs.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.680]   They don't talk about this stuff, right?
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:34.920]   I think their mistake is announcing things like HomeKit.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:35.920]   It's here.
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:36.920]   Yeah, boy.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:37.920]   It's like, "No, actually, it's not."
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.080]   You got nothing.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.240]   But they're not alone in that.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:47.440]   Google also, everybody's announced home automation and nothing has happened at all.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.440]   Let's take a break.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:51.640]   I want to talk to you guys about what you're up to in a second.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:59.320]   We can also talk about the big, they're calling it Cloudbleed, the big security issue
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.320]   at CloudFlare.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:06.320]   We had a CloudFlare and Crypto guy yesterday on the new screensavers to talk about.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.760]   It's a fascinating case study, if nothing else.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:10.560]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.760]   Certainly, if you are in the market for a new home and you're watching this show, you're
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:21.760]   thinking to yourself, "I don't really want to go into a loan office and gather a box
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.760]   of papers together.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.160]   I'd like to do this all online."
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:26.600]   And guess what?
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.920]   Quick and loans has your back.
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.480]   Rocket loan is the best home lender in the country.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.880]   You don't have to take my word for it.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:38.000]   One year after you're the JD Power Customer Satisfaction Awards, they are really great.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.720]   Have decided to make a product just for us geeks an entirely online mortgage process.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:46.640]   They call it Rocket Mortgage because it's 21st century.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:47.800]   It's fast.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:50.960]   It will lift you up.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:53.480]   It's nice to work with a lender that you trust.
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:57.960]   It's nice to have the transparency and the speed of the internet.
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:01.120]   You don't even have to waste time searching through stacks of paperwork.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:05.160]   Rocket Mortgage, you can actually securely share all the financial info they need to get mortgage

[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:18.480]   You can tailor it to just exactly what you want and get turned around and get approved

[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.320]   Excuse me, will you?
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.520]   I have three things I'm very curious about.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:00.520]   One, what you think is interesting at Mobile World Congress.
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:05.360]   Two, what you made of the FCC, JIT-PY stuff this week.
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.200]   He was on CNBC and had some comments.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:09.200]   And three, this cloud bleed.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.200]   What do you want to start with?
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:11.200]   You get to be the boss.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:12.200]   All three are good.
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.200]   Is this show being hijacked?
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:16.200]   Sorry.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.200]   We go way back.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.200]   We go way back.
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:21.880]   Starting in 1998, when she produced the screen savers in Caulfer Help, she was the person
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.720]   in my ear who was telling me what to say, what to do.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:26.720]   So I just listened to whatever.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:31.120]   I would like to talk about my new book, my new show and my past.
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.920]   We are going to talk about your new show.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.520]   And actually, the first time ever I've seen a PBS Go to Kickstarter to raise money for
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.520]   a show.
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:39.520]   That's very interesting.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.480]   But I guess we should talk about Mobile World Congress.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:46.600]   It starts technically tomorrow, although all day today, there were press conferences.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.040]   We tried to cover the Samsung press conference this morning, but they started 25 minutes
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.560]   late, so I had to cut it off.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.560]   And as it turned out, you missed nothing.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:45:00.920]   They announced a Galaxy Tab 3, which is an exact copy of an iPad, 9.7 inches.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:04.880]   The only difference is it's an OLED screen and probably a very nice OLED screen.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.880]   But it has a stylus.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.880]   It has all the same things the iPad has.
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:14.080]   Then they announced an exact copy of Microsoft Surface Pro 4, a tablet, Windows 10 computer
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.920]   with a detachable keyboard.
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:19.080]   And then they announced a copy of Google's Daydream.
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:23.360]   They take the Gear VR virtual reality headset, and it's basically the same, but they've
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:27.320]   added something that Google added to the Daydream a lot of people liked, which is a
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:29.200]   little controller or push button.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.840]   So that was Samsung's announcements.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.600]   They did not announce a new phone.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.600]   They said they wouldn't.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.880]   They're going to do that March 29th in New York City.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.880]   And then the note, of course, is in the fall, but the Galaxy S8, we expect them to announce
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.480]   that in March and April availability.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:48.360]   LG did announce a new LG G6, which looks pretty nice.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.360]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.720]   It's a super tall 5.7 inch screen.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:55.200]   They've decided that people want big screens, but they don't want a big phone.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.520]   In fact, everybody's trying to solve this.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.720]   Apple, I'm sure with the next iPhone will try to solve this.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.360]   Samsung has two with a curved screen.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.200]   This is going to be a weird aspect ratio, a two by one phone.
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:08.960]   So it's taller than you're used to, but the idea is you can hold it in your hand and
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:11.080]   still get lots of screen real estate.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:14.320]   Dual cameras as before with the G5.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:19.120]   I said to say they're removing the removable battery.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.600]   The G5 was one of the last phones.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.840]   You could still get a second battery and put it in.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.320]   There'll be two G6s.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:27.080]   One, the smaller one won't.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:30.680]   We'll have a removable battery, but the high end will not.
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.000]   And as a result, we'll have better battery life.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.680]   Nokia is back from the dead with the 30.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:35.680]   What do you think?
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.680]   I'm going to buy a 3310.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.680]   I'm going to buy the orange color one.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:39.680]   I'm going to buy two.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.800]   It's going to be from my kids from Scotland.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.000]   I had that phone.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.120]   And it was the candy bar phone, one of the best selling phones of all time.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.120]   They sold.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:52.800]   I read the number was like 75 million, some huge number of these because they're cheap.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.560]   This will be $50.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.720]   It is not a smartphone.
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:58.600]   It has a browser, but I doubt you'd want to use it.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:59.600]   Doesn't have a real keyboard.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.400]   It has a regular phone keyboard.
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.720]   What does it say the resolution the camera is?
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.720]   I'm curious about that.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.360]   640 by 480.
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.160]   No, it's better than that.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.160]   I hope.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.160]   It will snake.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.160]   It will snake.
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160]   It will snake.
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.160]   Snake is on it.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.160]   Snake is on it.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:20.440]   They're claiming 22 hours talk time 30 days standby time.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:21.440]   Oh my God.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:22.440]   That's hilarious.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.080]   Snake in color.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.920]   Snake in color, color snake.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:34.000]   You can get it in warm red and yellow, dark blue and gray.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.640]   So pick your car.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:36.640]   You know what?
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.120]   This may actually, of course, it's aimed at the developing world.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:45.360]   It's not aimed at the US market where the big five ship phones are.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.400]   This is totally the phone my kids are getting.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.200]   I mean, it makes perfect sense.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.200]   No texting.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:51.200]   It's just a phone.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.200]   The laborious texting.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:54.480]   Well, you can text, but yeah, you'd have to learn how to.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.440]   It does support 2G, but since most of the carriers are dumping their 2G networks, I don't
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:01.360]   think that matters.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.360]   Awesome battery.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.240]   2 megapixel camera.
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.800]   You weren't far off.
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.040]   David.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.240]   You weren't far off.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:09.240]   2 megapixel.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:10.240]   2 meg.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:13.320]   It does have an iPhone jack.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.760]   Does have an...
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.960]   You know who may have given this an inadvertent boost?
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.120]   The customs and border patrol.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:25.840]   I think there are a lot of people traveling will bring a phone like this overseas so they
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:28.800]   can get it back in the country without fear.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:34.040]   I'm going to Cuba for New Year's Eve this year.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.040]   If I get in.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:39.760]   The border patrol will look at this thing or the TSA, the laugh at you.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:41.960]   Say, "Oh, we don't need your pin, La Porte."
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:42.960]   We don't need your pin.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:45.240]   Don't get to turn on that phone.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:47.800]   We believe you.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.960]   But I figure if I go to Cuba, I'm going to have a hard time getting back in the country,
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:51.960]   right?
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:52.960]   This is going to be...
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:53.960]   I certainly will be challenged.
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.800]   What were you doing in Cuba?
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:57.160]   And with good reason in your case.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.160]   I think so.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:48:59.160]   Mm hmm.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.160]   Great, David.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.000]   You just made it worse.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.240]   I might as well just put...
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.880]   There a turban and put this phone in it.
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.720]   Oh, Leo.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.880]   Oh, that would be provocative.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.560]   Yeah, so this was one of the announcements.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.920]   Not only is the 3310, but back, but Nokia's back.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.920]   They're back making phones.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:24.720]   They deal with Microsoft was they couldn't make phones until this year.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.720]   But now they can.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:28.080]   Not that this is going to compete with a Windows phone.
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:30.640]   What about the BlackBerry key one?
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:31.640]   Do you see that?
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:36.160]   So now BlackBerry's back to its physical keyboard.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.920]   Traditional.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.880]   This is not inexpensive.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:42.120]   It's $549, which...
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:43.120]   Yikes.
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:47.040]   A number of tech blogs said, "Well, that's it.
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.240]   It's over."
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.840]   It does look like a BlackBerry, right?
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:51.840]   Because it has...
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.800]   It's Android, but it has the traditional keyboard at the bottom, not a slider.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.160]   Hey, did you hear Sony has a new VCR?
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.600]   Hey, kids.
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.600]   Polaroids back.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:04.720]   Actually, Polaroid really is back.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.080]   People really love those instant cameras.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:09.480]   It's the one that was actually the Fuji that was really good.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:10.480]   The Instax.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.640]   Did you get the Polaroid or the Instax?
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.200]   No, no, I didn't get any of them.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:14.200]   Polaroid.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.200]   Oh, you got one?
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.200]   Oh.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:21.000]   See, the Instax is a little bit easier for them to use because my little have that too.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000]   So I'll be curious.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]   You got to do a comparison with your guy.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000]   Yeah, I have to check it out.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.200]   I feel so left to pay.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.200]   The paper is the ridiculous.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.200]   I mean, 10.
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:31.200]   You get a little...
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.200]   A buck of shot.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.200]   A buck of shot.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.200]   A buck of shot.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:35.200]   A buck of shot.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:36.840]   Yeah, but each one is a sticker, right?
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:37.840]   The Instax one's in.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.840]   Oh, good.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:39.840]   Well, that's worth it then.
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:43.080]   Peel off the back of the zinc paper, whatever, and it's a sticker.
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.360]   You can get them with a sticker or non-sticker.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:49.320]   I just want to package like 50 on Amazon because we're going on a trip this week to spring
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:50.320]   training.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:53.760]   So I want to get a box for the kids to break to the beach, you know, for their cameras.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.760]   Oh, wow.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.760]   Natalie's pilgrimage.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:56.760]   No, no, no.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.760]   This is Philly's territory.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.760]   Philly's.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:00.760]   Oh.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:02.760]   You're going to Clearwater.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.760]   Exercise.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.760]   Oh boy.
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:05.760]   No more Scottsdale.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:06.760]   Oh, oh.
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.760]   I don't know.
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:10.160]   You're in laws aren't going to like that, buddy.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:11.160]   Cheese steaks.
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:14.840]   They have cheese steaks in Clearwater.
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:16.400]   They do it the Bright House Field there.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.400]   They have all...
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:18.400]   Really?
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.400]   They have a couple of local vendors from Philadelphia there.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.000]   Yeah, they've got some good stuff.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000]   Spring training is awesome.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000]   I love spring training.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.960]   What a cool thing.
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.960]   That's going to be fun.
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:28.240]   I brought the kids to spring training a few years.
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.240]   It was really fun.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:32.480]   They all, of course, but it was really fun.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:33.800]   What are their phone announcements?
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:36.560]   I think that's it.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:41.840]   Well, no, Kia said they're starting to dive into like Fitbit type stuff.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.800]   They bought withings or wything stuff.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:44.800]   Ythings, yeah.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.680]   I like the wything stuff.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.680]   I've used wything stuff.
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:51.080]   Oh, they're going to finally get rid of that weird French name that nobody could pronounce.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.080]   Well, that's right.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:58.600]   And what's funny is I asked the wything's PR rep if it's withings, withings, wything's,
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:00.920]   or whatever you want.
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.320]   No, no, she said it used to be.
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:06.520]   She said it's changed.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.520]   It was originally wything's.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:11.720]   And now it's correct to say withings or the other way.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:17.800]   I was also told withings and I will tell you, David, I got the smackdown from Nokia.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:18.800]   It's not Nokia.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:23.440]   Every time we say it, we say we get people from Norway or Finland or whatever is calling
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:25.600]   and saying you're not saying it right.
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.520]   It's just south of Nokki.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.520]   It's just like Nokia.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:30.520]   Nokia.
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.000]   Nokia's the one that will really get you in trouble though.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.560]   Is it Nutella or Nutella?
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.560]   It's Nutella.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:36.560]   No.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.560]   Nutella.
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:38.560]   It's Nutella?
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:39.560]   Nutella.
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:44.480]   You'll find the two factions warring like red states and blue states over that one.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:51.440]   This was my nightmare when I was covering viruses back in the late 90s, early 2000s because
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.880]   people would make up these insane names.
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:57.760]   And there was no way of knowing what the correct pronunciation was.
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:00.640]   I think that's my favorite site online is how do you pronounce it?
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.120]   Have you ever done that?
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:05.320]   And it has the correct pronunciation for everything.
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.520]   It's the most ingenious site.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:13.320]   Today, speaking of Internet Wars, is exactly the second anniversary of the dress.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.320]   Oh.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.800]   In February 26, 2015, it's two years old.
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:22.120]   You know you're old when an Internet meme makes you feel old.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.960]   But we can resurrect it.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.840]   What color is this dress?
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.840]   Is it?
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.840]   No, no, no.
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:34.760]   That is so funny because on Tuesday, I was at USC for this shoot about the Star Wars
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:37.120]   dead character digital resurrection thing.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:39.480]   And they had that dress hanging up.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:40.480]   What?
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.240]   Yeah, well, I mean, you couldn't buy it.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.720]   It wasn't the one photograph.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.400]   It was the same dress.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:50.520]   And I asked, why didn't you explain it to me since you're an optics guy?
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.720]   And he said, give me your phone.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:55.680]   And he did the coolest thing, which you can do on your own.
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.680]   You see that dress.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:00.240]   So your phone has a white balance sensor, right?
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:02.880]   It tries to make everything spread the spectrum.
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:03.880]   Right.
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:07.280]   So when I held the phone back like this, it was clearly blue and black.
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.520]   The actual answer is blue and black, by the way.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.240]   No, it's gold and white.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:12.240]   What do you look at that?
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:14.120]   You say blue and black?
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.760]   Yes, I always have.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.320]   But in person is blue and black.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:28.120]   But if you bring your camera, if you bring your camera close enough that it loses the
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:34.040]   context of the background, the white balance thing says, oh, that blue, that must equal
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:35.040]   white.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.680]   I need to brighten that all up.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:39.680]   And it starts adjusting the contrast of the whites and darks.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:43.320]   So you're saying in person it is blue and black when you look at it with your eyes.
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:47.960]   In real life is blue and black.
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:48.960]   Wow.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.080]   We've learned something two years later.
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:54.080]   And it's with things.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:57.160]   See, I always say it's a Wi-Fi scale.
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:58.160]   It's a lot.
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.160]   It makes sense.
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.160]   But see, that's weird.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:01.160]   They're French.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.880]   It's probably with things.
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.040]   We think.
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:09.840]   I think their CEO even told me years ago at CES, I asked him and he said it's why things
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.840]   because Wi-Fi.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:11.840]   Wi-Fi.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:12.840]   That's why I've always said Wi-Fi.
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:13.840]   It's why they're just.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.840]   Clearly that's before it changed, Clay.
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:16.840]   They're just on.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:18.840]   The other thing is, is it not?
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:20.360]   I was talking about it.
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.720]   Is it Legoland or Legoland?
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:23.720]   Lego.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:24.720]   Lego?
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:28.000]   Yeah, it turns out it depends on which one you call.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.760]   I actually called them up and asked the receptionist.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.160]   Is it Molus Gine?
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.160]   Molus Moleskin?
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:35.160]   Is it Berenstein bears?
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:36.160]   Molus Gine.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:37.160]   That one I know.
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:38.160]   Wow.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.160]   This is going to be a little bit more.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:43.640]   Wow, this is going deep.
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.280]   So that was Story 1 Mobile World Congress.
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.800]   There's a lot more.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:55.720]   One thing I didn't mention, which was a little weird, during the Samsung event, somebody came
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:01.960]   on stage and a protester and the speaker was right at the beginning and said, "Okay,
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:02.960]   you've made your point.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:04.520]   Get off stage."
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:05.520]   We didn't see it.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:11.200]   There's a Greenpeace protester with an inscrutable message.
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.320]   He had a yellow flag with the recycling logo on it.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:18.680]   Inside it said Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and then hashtag Greenpeace.
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:23.960]   I'm not sure what the point was, but that's in case you were wondering.
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:28.240]   There's still like 17% of those phones are still out being used.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.640]   He wanted people to recycle the restaurant.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.200]   He was doing, yeah.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:37.640]   The factory that was recycling the batteries caught on fire.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.160]   Oh, God.
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:40.640]   Oh, God.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.840]   So it's just bad all around.
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:44.840]   Okay, so that was Story 1.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:45.840]   Right.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.000]   Story 2, I've been following the saga of your attempting to figure out your relationship
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.480]   with Jit Pai, the new head of the SEC.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:55.720]   Yeah, I'm trying to get him the benefit of the doubt, but he's not helping.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:57.600]   Yeah, you're kind of trying to figure it out, right?
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:04.480]   So this week he repealed privacy regulations for ISPs, and just make sure I get this right
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:09.520]   so that they can't sell your data the way that search engines and social networks can
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:11.760]   sell your data for advertisers.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:19.600]   This was a relatively new rule created last fall under democratically controlled agency
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:27.280]   that said that cable and wireless internet service providers had actually tougher privacy
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:31.760]   restrictions than Facebook, Google, or Google.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:36.400]   So for instance, the FCC rules said that marketing of web browsing history would require your
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.440]   permission.
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:39.200]   You're opt in.
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:46.280]   The FTC requires opt in only for certain sensitive categories of information for Google and Facebook.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:52.080]   So Pai's position, and this is by the way, I believe what's really going on.
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:58:00.400]   Pai wants to eliminate FCC regulation of the internet entirely and put it under the FTC,
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:02.480]   the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.920]   On this issue, not on every issue.
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:09.080]   I think on every issue, he doesn't, he doesn't believe the FCC should have a regulatory role
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.640]   when it comes to the internet.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:16.000]   Okay, so he was on CNBC, and I got this, that watched it, and I recommend watching it because
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.480]   he's got a measure of the man, more so than all of these discussions, kind of trying to
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.200]   figure out what he's about.
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:27.680]   So to give you a little, the most important part is my own view is that light touch regulation
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:34.360]   means we create broad regulatory frameworks to protect consumers, but blah, blah, blah,
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:37.040]   competitive marketplace being the primary thing.
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:42.560]   We shouldn't micromanage how these companies operate in the absence of evidence of a market
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:43.560]   failure.
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:48.680]   The problem is, it is in a competitive marketplace, and that's partly thanks to the FCC, but it
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:50.400]   is not a competitive marketplace.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:55.080]   86% of Americans only have two choices, your cable company and your phone company for internet
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:57.520]   service, and a great many have one choice.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.520]   That's not competitive.
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:03.400]   Yeah, and why are we talking about the privacy thing when this is the guy who wants to get
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.400]   rid of net neutrality?
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.400]   Why aren't we, why haven't we?
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:08.400]   Well, it's all of a piece.
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:14.120]   It's all of a piece, and I really think that, did he address this, this FTC thing?
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:18.080]   Because, you know, some people say, well, of course you don't want the FTC to regulate
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:23.000]   it because they're overburdened trying to regulate things like false ad claims.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000]   They have, the FCC does not have an enforcement arm.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.800]   The FTC does, but they're doing many other things.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:33.800]   In the CNBC article, or in the CNBC interview, he didn't address that directly, but in some
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:36.920]   of the other articles about this, he says that if they're going to do it, they should
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:42.600]   do a broad regulatory framework that affects everyone's sense of this as opposed to just
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:43.600]   picking and choosing.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:44.600]   Right.
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:47.760]   What does that framework look like?
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:49.680]   Who's going to, you know, who's going to, we get to weigh in on this framework?
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:51.760]   What does that regulatory framework even look like?
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:54.960]   It's nice to be able to throw around loose language like that.
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:57.560]   And why repeal before you have a replace?
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:02.840]   Well, the bottom line is, I mean, the elephant in the room is that he was a Verizon lawyer,
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:05.360]   and he is, he's a pro-
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:07.120]   But Tom Wheeler was also a king.
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:11.520]   Anti-consumer, I know, but Tom Wheeler got pushed back from the public and changed his
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.520]   mind.
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.520]   Right.
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:18.080]   And in fact, end up being a great defender of the public interest, I think.
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:24.800]   Everything Pi has done or said is to the benefit of the bottom line of the Comcasts and against
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:25.800]   the interests of the consumer.
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:30.880]   Well, I mean, if you could say that about the Trump administration in general.
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:31.880]   True.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:32.880]   Yeah.
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.520]   I mean, that seems like it's overarching.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:40.520]   I mean, his comment here was, otherwise we don't sit in judgment from Washington, D.C.
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:44.720]   My own view is that the internet should be run by technologists and engineers and business
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:48.200]   people, not by lawyers and bureaucrats here in the nation's capital.
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.200]   I mean, that's just-
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.200]   Who can disagree with that?
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.200]   I don't disagree with that.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:53.960]   Well, but then that's also just standard, you know, that's kind of-
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.440]   Spoiler, it's a public policy.
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:56.440]   Spoiler, yeah.
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:59.960]   Well, I mean, would part of the framework be, hey, these cable companies get the opportunity
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:01.200]   then to look at this data.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:04.960]   They get to understand it's their business after all the pipes through which these users
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:05.960]   are using their data.
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:09.160]   I mean, using their information through their pipes.
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:11.840]   And we'd like to know, can we provide better service to individuals?
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:16.200]   It's not merely though, it's not merely know that Clayton, it's sell it that we're concerned
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.200]   about.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.200]   Right.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:19.200]   Right.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.200]   Right.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.760]   I mean, and I think people often, we hear always people complaining about Google and Facebook
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:22.760]   what they know about us.
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:25.080]   No one knows more about you than your ISP.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:28.600]   Everything goes through your ISP, including your Google and Facebook stuff.
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:32.440]   Anything is not encrypted anyway.
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.040]   You know, I am still, I think the jury's still out.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:42.320]   I think what I hope for is a kind of more traditional Republican administration that
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:50.640]   favors deregulation as opposed to what I'm fearing we're getting, which is a Trump administration
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:58.160]   run chiefly by Steve Bannon's doctrine of eliminating government entirely.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:01.920]   I did not get that sense from him in that interview and it was much, it was comforting
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:03.920]   to me along those lines.
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:10.280]   Because at CPAC, Bannon basically said, what we want to do is get rid of all of these administrative.
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:15.480]   We want to get rid of these cabinet jobs, not cabinet jobs, get rid of these agencies,
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:19.400]   cabinet agencies, just eliminate them entirely.
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:22.600]   That would be a little more scary to me than a more, I'd be very happy with a kind of more
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.560]   traditional outlook, Republican outlook on this at this point.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:27.560]   We'll see.
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:29.400]   All I can say is we got to watch.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:35.240]   And here's why David, I'm being, I'm reluctant to, because Tom Wheeler, we really did think
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:37.400]   he was going to be a jerk.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:39.160]   John Oliver called him a dingo.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:44.440]   Was it John Oliver or was it, might have been on the daily show, might have been John Stewart.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:47.840]   He said, you know, I think he, John Oliver, did that whole thing.
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:48.840]   Putting internet neutrality.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:53.640]   Net neutrality in the hands of Tom Wheeler would be like giving your baby to a dingo.
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:03:00.440]   And he turned, and John Oliver apologized and Tom Wheeler said, I am not a dingo.
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:03.960]   And he turned out not to be.
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.360]   So I'm hopeful, right?
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:08.360]   And his privacy rules were pretty, I mean, they're pretty stringent.
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.000]   They go pretty far, exactly.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000]   And that's in fact what's being overturned right now.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.200]   I think that though you're right, David, when you say it was, it was the public response
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:22.520]   that changed his mind, overwhelming public response in the case of net neutrality.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:27.400]   So let's keep that pressure up and tell them what we want.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:29.400]   Maybe we can influence it.
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:33.840]   All right, last story, heart bleed.
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:36.760]   And it's not really, there's not much to say about this.
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:38.080]   It's a very technical topic.
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:42.920]   I guarantee you will be covering it in great depth on Tuesday with Steve Gibson.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:51.240]   But in short, on a week ago, Saturday, a Tavis Ormondy at Google started noticing some very
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:59.240]   odd data in cached information from websites dug deeper.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:03.880]   And he realized it was websites that were using services from CloudFlare, which is a
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:10.760]   CDN network often used by people to prevent DDoS attacks and for other purposes.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:14.280]   And contacted, well, he didn't contact CloudFlare.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:17.400]   He tweeted to CloudFlare.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.560]   And CloudFlare reacted very quickly on Friday.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:24.240]   It was an all-hands event a week ago Friday.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:30.400]   And within 47 minutes, they discovered and fixed the bug, a bug that was a kind of weird
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.640]   interaction between two different pieces of software they use.
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:36.320]   And so they mitigated it.
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:40.440]   They didn't announce it publicly until Google wiped the cached information, which took them
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:41.680]   another week.
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:44.720]   And we learned about this just a few days ago.
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:51.240]   And if Cloudble affected a large number of sites, although if you're interested, I do
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:57.400]   encourage you to watch the interview we did yesterday on the new screen savers with the
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:01.720]   chief of encryption at CloudFlare, who I think did a good job of explaining it.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:08.360]   And what he essentially said was, our CTO, who was a good friend of the show, John Graham
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:12.520]   coming, I've known him for years, and myself, we are not changing our passwords.
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:15.880]   So that should give you some idea of how serious we consider this.
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:19.760]   It is not hair on fire time, by any means.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:22.760]   But we'll watch this with interest.
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:23.760]   It's pretty technical.
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:29.480]   So I'm not sure there's a whole lot to say except I think CloudFlare responded appropriately
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:33.280]   and quickly and did what needed to be done.
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:35.600]   And I don't think they were to blame for this.
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:40.600]   This wasn't a case of them accidentally leaking information because they did things stupidly
[02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:41.600]   or badly.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:45.600]   But they were using a bug, a really pretty stupid programming bug in a library that
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:49.520]   we're using that interacted poorly with some of the other software they were using.
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:55.720]   What seemed interesting to me about this is wondering if it isn't a service or maybe
[02:05:55.720 --> 02:06:00.040]   incumbent, may not incumbent, but it would be a nice service from your password managers
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:04.280]   like LastPass to be the determinants of when you do need to change your passwords.
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.080]   They don't do anything like that, do they?
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:07.080]   They do.
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:12.120]   So if one password and LastPass have a security check up there, watchtower program on OnePass
[02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:14.120]   and LastPass security check.
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:20.160]   But the problem is it's not, it's very difficult to know A, what sites were affected and B,
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:21.320]   when information was leaked.
[02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:23.240]   There's no way to know that.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:26.960]   So this isn't like the target breach where you can look at a database released of target
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:32.000]   information and say, oh, well, look at all these email addresses you've been pwned.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000]   This isn't going to show up in that way.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.560]   So it's very difficult for them to do that in other words.
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:39.560]   However, if-
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:42.160]   And LastPass services is passive though.
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:46.840]   You have to go in and dig around and find that security check as opposed to when you
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:50.760]   log on to your vault and then it would say, hey, just so you know, this vulnerability
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:55.080]   happened and therefore this password could be vulnerable.
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:58.080]   It's impossible, unfortunately it's impossible to know.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:02.160]   So but the good news about any password vault is they generally have some sort of simple
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:05.880]   automated system where you can change passwords.
[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:09.760]   In my opinion, you don't need to, especially if you're using two factor authentication.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:14.140]   This, if you have two factor turned on an important accounts, you really don't have
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:15.680]   anything to worry about.
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:18.160]   But I would suggest you listen to our interview with Nick Sullivan.
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:19.760]   He's the head of crypto, a cloud player.
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:23.680]   We talked to him yesterday on the new screensavers and tune in Tuesday because Steve Gibson
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:24.680]   will have a deep dive.
[02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:30.280]   I'm sure into this bug and what it means and what you could do to mitigate it.
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:35.400]   In my opinion, there's nothing to worry about at this point.
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:36.400]   But it's hard to know.
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.400]   Good news and security.
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:41.840]   Yeah, it's better news than well, and if you, you know, for instance, there's a GitHub
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:46.880]   page that publishes a list of every company that uses cloud flare, they're not all affected
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:47.880]   by this.
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:52.920]   In fact, it was a very tiny percentage of companies that use cloud flare that were that are affected
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:53.920]   by this.
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:08:00.120]   So it's probably not a problem, but you never know, do you?
[02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:06.840]   All right, David Polk, tell me why Nova has decided to go to Kickstarter to raise money
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.240]   for, is it a show?
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:10.640]   What is it exactly you're doing?
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:12.800]   Yes, it is a show.
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:18.840]   It's a two hour special about molecules and the elements called beyond the elements.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:19.840]   And you're right.
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:25.120]   This is really kind of extraordinary that a public television show is seeking money from
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:27.600]   the public via a Kickstarter campaign.
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:30.520]   It's novakickstarter.com.
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:32.440]   And we're looking to get, yeah, there we go.
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:36.280]   We're looking to make $200,000 to start shooting this thing.
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.440]   And we're about halfway there.
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:45.200]   And, you know, it comes at a time when both public broadcasting is being defunded and science
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:46.920]   is being defunded.
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:53.080]   So to me, it's kind of like, guys, let's show the world that science matters, science education
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.080]   matters.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:58.800]   Nova is an amazing show. It's been on the air for almost 45 years. It's the most watched
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:00.720]   science show in America.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:05.040]   It's a great show and you're great on it. I watch it every single week. I love Nova.
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:06.040]   Well, thank you.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:11.000]   So we're, yeah, so this is a sequel to "Hunting the Elements" that I hosted in 2012. It's
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:18.200]   now a staple of high school science curriculums all over the country. And we're hoping to
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:19.520]   take it one step farther.
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:23.640]   But, I mean, just getting involved with this, as always with Kickstarter, it's not just about
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:29.480]   the money, right? They're these cool rewards. And one of them is, as we shoot this show,
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:34.280]   I will be sending you, you know, outtakes and bloopers and backstage videos right from
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:40.320]   my phone in the various places we go. And there's some cool rewards, too. You can have
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:41.320]   lunch with me.
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:42.320]   Yeah.
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.320]   Who wouldn't want to back that?
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:47.440]   I feel like we've cheated because one of the levels of rewards is a video chat with
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:50.840]   you, David. And here I am kind of doing that.
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:51.840]   So, but this...
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:54.080]   Well, I look for your name in the list of backers, Leo.
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:58.680]   Now, you got a ways to go. And I think that one of the things I remember you... Well,
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:01.240]   what did you initially ask for a million dollars? Was that right?
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.800]   Yeah, we... Yeah. The original ask was a million dollars. We're going to try to almost fund
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:11.920]   the thing through Kickstarter. And unfortunately, we launched the day after the inauguration
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:18.880]   when, you know, the country's hair was on fire and people were funding really important
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:23.800]   things, you know, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. And it was kind of like we ranked too
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:28.920]   low on the who cares meter, I think, at the time. So we close that, we've relaunched it
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:29.920]   to the much lower target.
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.200]   And you're almost there. You're halfway there anyway. 12 days to go. 91,000 raised. 200,000
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:39.280]   is the goal. There are 1,000 backers so far. This is definitely worthwhile. And this isn't
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:44.040]   really, in a sense, this isn't new for public broadcasting. It's always been supported by
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:45.040]   its viewers.
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:46.040]   That's true.
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:51.280]   That the stations are supported by the viewers. And then that money trickles back through
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:55.760]   a very complicated series of channels, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:02.600]   and WGBH and eventually winds up at the individual shows. But this is a really remarkable experiment
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:09.320]   going directly from Nova to the public. In fact, one particular special, one documentary
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.080]   that we're trying to make to the public.
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:14.760]   I like it. I think it's a great idea. Yeah.
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:21.000]   It'll be cool. I just kick in 10 bucks and become part of the movement that you'll get
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.040]   a lot of fun stuff just out of that.
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.760]   What did you say? Nova.kicksstarted.com? Is that the?
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:27.080]   Just Nova.kicksstarted.com.
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:31.920]   Nova.kicksstarted.com. One word. Great, David. Good luck. And thanks for the great work you
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:38.280]   do. You're really great on Nova and CBS this morning. Of course, at Yahoo Finance. And
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.280]   it's always nice to have you on the show. I really appreciate it.
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:41.280]   Thank you, Ken, sir.
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:42.280]   It's a pleasure.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:46.840]   Becky Worley, what are you up to? You're doing GMA every day, it seems like.
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:54.600]   Yeah. Well, that's my gig. I give my plug to David. Go give a buck to his Kickstarter.
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:57.720]   It seems important to me that we have to keep telling stories about science.
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:03.120]   Yes. Yes. Watch me on Good Morning America, but go give some money to David. And also,
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:05.840]   I don't know why I'm plugging everyone else. But Clayton, I have to tell you, I've been
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:08.200]   loving your real estate investing podcast.
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:13.000]   Well, you're very, very sweet. Thank you so much. Yeah. And I will plug, because my wife
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:19.200]   and I Natalie do that show together. We talk about real estate and building net worth and
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:23.240]   accelerating your financial freedom, how to pay off your house in a few years using our
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:28.600]   HELOC strategy. And so we tell you know how we do it with rental real estate. We, you
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:33.360]   know, we buy, try to buy a property once a month as our goal this year. And we tell
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:39.760]   you how we do it all the ways you can save on taxes, depreciation, all of the, more millionaires
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:45.080]   have been built in this country around owning real estate than any other form of investing.
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:48.960]   And so we walk you through our strategy on how we do it with single family properties.
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:52.440]   And so, yeah, the investing in real estate podcast, we do it three times a week if you
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:55.480]   can believe that. You're up to 122 episodes. Yeah.
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:59.840]   Yeah. And Inc Magazine this week just named us one of the top business podcasts. So thank
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:02.840]   you to Inc Magazine for that. Wow. Congratulations.
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:08.120]   Yeah. I would also like to add that this is the first podcast my new puppy has made it
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:15.760]   through. Oh, wow. This is Akamai. Nicely named Akamai. That's why it's bigger than you
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:22.640]   are. Does Akamai mean something in Hawaiian or I mean, smart? Oh, I knew it was the Akamai
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:28.240]   content delivery network. Yeah. That's a Hawaiian word meaning smart. Yeah. So there you go.
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:37.240]   So this is my plug. My entire department. Talk to my loves these tech. Not to mention
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:41.680]   your daughter being very quiet too. I know you're that's that went well. Yes. See, I
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:47.200]   broke my screen policy for you guys. Thank you. Thank you. We'll go all watch the Oscars
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:51.280]   because that's that's what's coming up next. Thanks so much to all three of you. Thanks
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:56.640]   to all of you for joining us. We do it every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific. That's 6 p.m.
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:00.640]   Eastern time. We started a little early today. If you tune in and said what they're starting
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:05.160]   already, well, we wanted to get everybody out of here by Oscar time. But normally 3 p.m.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:10.720]   Pacific's, 6 p.m. Eastern 2300 UTC. If you watch live, join us in the chat. Remierc.twit.tv.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:14.520]   And of course, we make it on demand audio and video available of every single show at
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:21.520]   twit.tv slash. I don't know what it is. Just go to twit.tv. This is the one show that
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:26.160]   doesn't have its own dedicated URL because it would be twit.tv slash twit. Does that
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:32.480]   work? Maybe it does. You can also subscribe. It's maybe a little bit easier to find twit
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:37.480]   in a podcast application where everywhere you subscribe. Let me just see twit.tv slash
