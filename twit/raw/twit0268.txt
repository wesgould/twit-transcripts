[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.120]   We chew on it.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.840]   We ruminate.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.720]   We masticate.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.800]   We spit it out.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.640]   And now you know the rest of the story, starting to my left.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.400]   Robert Scobble.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.120]   The Scobble Lizer is in the house.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.640]   How are you doing?
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.000]   Nice to see you, Robert.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.360]   We watched you drive up on a new site called Glimpse, G-L-Y-M-P-S-E.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.000]   And what's OpenStack?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.880]   And what's OpenStack?
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.640]   I got a couple in the car.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.080]   Is that a Rackspace thing?
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.480]   It's the OpenCloud.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.840]   We open the--
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.400]   That's right.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.440]   Rackspace supports the OpenCloud.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.720]   So we're going to recuse you on all cloud subjects today.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.640]   Ome's the expert.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.160]   Ome is the expert.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.960]   He's been writing great articles in the last three or four days,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.000]   or his team has been.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.640]   We're thrilled to have Ome Malek back on with us.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.040]   Ome is the man in charge of Giga Ome, which is now
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.520]   a network of blogs.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.200]   Good to see you, Ome.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.280]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.880]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.080]   Take a read back.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.160]   Also in studio with us today, Owen, JJ Stone.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.080]   You know him as O-Dokta.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.040]   O-Dokta.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.720]   Hello, sir.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.960]   Did you call me child?
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.880]   Sir.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   Hello, kid.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.440]   I knew you was a great classy.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.960]   Hello.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.920]   This guy drinks bourbon with a sweatband, because he knows.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560]   That's how we do it in the West Coast.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.320]   We do not want to dilute the fine bourbon.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.720]   So I think, I think, Ome, you get to pride
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.280]   of place for the scoop of the week earlier this week.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.200]   You announced that Tech Crunch was going to be sold to AOL.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.640]   That was a week, exactly a week ago,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.000]   because the next morning, Mike Harrington
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.160]   takes the stage with some AOL suit and confirms.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.520]   How did you know?
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.320]   It's my job, isn't it?
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   It is.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.520]   Are you happy to see Tech Crunch go to AOL?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.880]   I'm very happy for Michael.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.560]   I think he's worked really hard for it.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.680]   So yes, definitely happy.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.880]   I don't think they're going away.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.480]   Unlike a lot of people, I don't believe that's
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.600]   the last we've heard of Tech Crunch.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.480]   This is just a different parent company.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.960]   Just they'll be business-based people there.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.360]   Well, in their defense, they haven't gadget.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.000]   They haven't ruined and gadget.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.400]   It's still the same great place it always was.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.200]   Joystick.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.000]   Joystick.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.800]   They've got a lot of content.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.360]   TMC, there's a blog you'd like to change, but they haven't.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.760]   Nevertheless, you wonder how Mike is going to get along
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.040]   with the suits.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.800]   It's fun.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.000]   The night home broke that story I had dinner with,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.640]   the third shareholder in Tech Crunch, Keith's here.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.320]   And he says he thinks Arrington will do very well
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.200]   in a big company.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.280]   He's been blogging already about the meetings.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.200]   The meetings.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.560]   But that's sort of funny, you know.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.520]   No, Mike has a great sense of humor.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   You saw the--
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.440]   I hope he has a great sense of humor.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.960]   You saw the geek culture, Joy of Tech comic.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.280]   On the day it went down, it says,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.960]   Mike Arrington's first day at AOL.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.080]   Hey, do you have any stolen documents I can post up?
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.440]   By the way, his t-shirt says, you've got Mike.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.240]   And when can I start work on the AOL pad?
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.600]   Sheesh, you mean to say you jerks only work 10 hours a day
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.760]   here?
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.440]   What slackers?
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.200]   Holy crap, there's some people eating lunch together.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.600]   This is collusion.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.080]   AOL must be planning to control the flow of the internet.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.880]   It's AOL gate.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.120]   What a scoop.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.080]   Tim.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.000]   He's stuck in the seat.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.040]   I'm just reading my contract.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.080]   I see obnoxious arrogant and a-hole are on the OK list.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.200]   But can I still remain in the internet blow hard?
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.160]   Finally.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.800]   Screw this.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.760]   I can't wait three years.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.520]   He kicks him out.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.440]   Of course, that's fiction.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.240]   But I think a lot of people are saying,
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.800]   I wonder how long before Mike just rubs somebody.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.000]   Well, he has quite a few million reasons
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.800]   to stick around for three years.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.840]   How much do you think?
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.800]   Well, the rumor-- and tell me the latest rumors,
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.720]   but the rumor was $25 million cash and $40 million
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.680]   with the urnout.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.440]   So total of $40, not $25 plus $40.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.560]   Is that right to you, Oum?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.040]   I mean, that's the rumor I've heard,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   but I don't know anything.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.960]   Isn't that a lot?
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.880]   This could be a lot more.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.440]   Yeah, other people are like, wow.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.040]   Mike could have gotten more for it.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.600]   Look, I don't know the exact value.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.360]   So I wouldn't even say that's the right number.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.200]   It could be higher.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.080]   It could be lower.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.160]   I do not know.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.440]   So I probably won't speculate.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.040]   But--
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.640]   You can't see Mike going for less than Jason Calick.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.320]   Can I sold WebLogs, think, though?
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.880]   Well, WebLogs went for $130.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.320]   No, it's--
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.680]   Didn't it?
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.400]   $28 in the $28--
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.080]   I thought it was more.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.920]   I think that's a very simplistic view
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.160]   of thinking about things.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.880]   Robert, I think Michael is, at the end of the day,
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.240]   a smart businessman.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.560]   And he would have made a right smart business
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.040]   decision with this sale.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.120]   I don't think he's sitting there.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.880]   And it's not as much of an ego sale,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.840]   but it's more of like, what's the maximum return I can get?
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.340]   Right.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.180]   I'm talking about an ego.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.200]   Cringley says, well, I think it was $7.5 million,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.400]   because that's all I was worth.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.280]   And when I was talking to him, I don't know.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.680]   I think that sounds like rank jealousy.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.920]   What is Mike saying his revenue is on--
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.520]   Tech Reviews saying--
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.120]   Well, in "Ink" magazine was saying $10 million.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.040]   Wow.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.440]   That's a lot for a blog.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.120]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.800]   That's the kind of thing.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.200]   It's like unreal fake money.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.720]   When people throw out numbers like that,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.240]   at the end of the day, what's the value
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.480]   that they're going to get back?
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.920]   A lot of people say they make $2 million in ad revenue.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.220]   And Leo, you sell ads, and you have an audience.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.180]   And you know how hard it is to get that ad revenue coming in.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.460]   So it's still blogged at the end of the day,
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.060]   and AO will be in behind it.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.580]   Great.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.500]   We'll see what happens.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.780]   I mean, he got his paycheck.
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.340]   He worked hard.
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.300]   He busts his butt.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.180]   He's walking around bags in any of his eyes all the time.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.780]   Like, he has no sleep.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.740]   So he didn't look good at the--
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.980]   It disrupts it.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.220]   Hopefully now he gets to take a nap,
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.660]   because he really looks very tired.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.300]   He's walking around like he's on his death bed.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.580]   So if this check gives him some peace of mind,
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.600]   then good on him, at least for that.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.120]   But the value of things, I mean--
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.280]   Is this the beginning of a land grab, a gold rush for content?
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.840]   Do you think, Ome--
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.000]   Most of his revenues came from events.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.680]   It was events.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.000]   Like, it like, disrupt.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.680]   And like, Ome is building-- you guys
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.760]   have lots of cool events, right?
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.920]   We do have events.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.680]   We have research.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.720]   We have advertising.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.560]   So we have three different revenue streams.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.000]   So definitely not banking on just one revenue stream
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   to grow out of business.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.160]   It's kind of inside baseball.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.420]   I want to spend a huge amount on it.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.880]   But since you broke the story, Ome and everybody here
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.120]   knows Mike and has some sort of relationship with him.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.340]   Mike was actually pissed that you broke the story,
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:22.680]   which was the--
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.280]   He wanted a break, I'm sure.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.580]   Well, they were planning-- he told me they were planning
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.920]   on announcing it the night afterwards.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.520]   And they--
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.760]   So he had to announce it.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.480]   It disrupt.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.320]   Well, they had to announce it in the morning.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.560]   And they had to move Tim's flights around
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.040]   and all sorts of fun stuff.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.520]   So congrats, Ome, for disrupting.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.720]   Disrupt.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.280]   Nice job.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.560]   Somebody had to do it, right?
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.520]   If not me, somebody else would have done it.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.720]   So I think the more important thing
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.400]   is this is good for his team.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.800]   It's good for him.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.240]   It's a validation for this market more than anything else.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.880]   I remember five years ago, Leo, you
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.640]   know this really well.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.600]   That five years ago, people kind of
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.640]   joked about blogs, and didn't take them very seriously.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.080]   And everything was just-- especially the mainstream media
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.960]   dismissed them as just a bunch of hoo-haws.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.920]   And here you are, you know, one of few million reasons
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.160]   to think otherwise.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.520]   I think that is what is the key takeaway from this.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.840]   I think between Mike and Rafat Ali, you build and so
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.360]   paid content, I think we've proven
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.640]   that there is an opportunity in this new kind of media
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.840]   that some of us are trying to create.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.640]   And I think it's working.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.400]   But you know, I mean, look, at the end of the day,
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.560]   AO won't have bought TechCrunch if they didn't think
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.120]   there was value in it.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.160]   Nobody likes to spend money, especially somebody
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.000]   asked Martis, "Hey, Mom, strong would spend money on something
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.120]   without really thinking through the financial upside to that."
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.000]   So I think, you know, people are being pretty
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.760]   dismissive of the intelligence of the people involved
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.320]   in this transaction.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.800]   Not the people I talk to.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.160]   I mean, most of the entrepreneurs I've gotten around to
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.640]   this last week have said this makes AO well very interesting.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.520]   Oh, really?
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.280]   So was it good?
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.880]   I'll tell you.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.000]   40 million to make AO more interesting,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.920]   it's worth every penny.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.800]   What was the platform, was it Newsweek that sold for like
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.000]   five million dollars?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.640]   And you look at that and you're like, "Well, it's Newsweek."
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.720]   Like, you know, I go to my grandmother
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.800]   and I can say TechCrunch and she'll keep walking,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.880]   not know what I'm talking about.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.760]   I say Newsweek, she's like, "Oh, Newsweek."
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.800]   And she can start talking about it.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.560]   And I'm going to show you the difference between old and new.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.320]   And that's the thing that gives me about the evaluation of
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:37.520]   things.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.120]   I mean, not that he doesn't deserve the amount of money
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.720]   that he got.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.200]   It says, "How do you go from a staple and a natural culture
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.720]   and an icon of a company?"
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.680]   I mean, granted that it's the dinosaur, paper, back, whatever.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.560]   But, and then you go and triple quadruple quintuplet
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.520]   the value for a blog.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.520]   Well, Leo's talked a lot about this,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.560]   that the disruption that's happened in media in the last
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.000]   10 years is extreme.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I mean, Leo, look around.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.960]   You know, you have probably 50,000 dollars with a gear here.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.680]   But you can cut.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.960]   Which is nothing compared to a television studio.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.680]   As you know.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.200]   Yeah, on tech TV, you spend a million dollars on a phone.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.120]   A million just for a set.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.480]   A million for a control room.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.280]   And this represents a huge disruption in media, right?
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.840]   The fact that Mike, out of his bedroom, can write a blog
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.720]   and build it into something that now is worth more than news week.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.000]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.120]   That's a great stat, Owen.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.960]   I mean, that really does say--
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.600]   And that only has a company.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.560]   How many people working for you, Owen, now?
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.680]   How about 25?
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.040]   Wow.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.240]   How many people are working for home?
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.040]   He's starting in his bedroom.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.880]   You quit your job in mainstream news
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.680]   and started writing a blog, right?
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.120]   June 2006.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.560]   I think my answer to that comment is that 50 years ago,
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.440]   a life boy was a great brand.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.920]   Kodak was a great brand.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:00.200]   Well, great brands have a shelf value in historical
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.520]   and context.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.840]   And I think the cultural context is the internet today
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.560]   to the media.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.080]   And from that perspective, tech range
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.600]   is valued more than news week.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.680]   Every news week hasn't really done anything
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.040]   to be valued higher.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.240]   It gets been on the wrong side of the media equation
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.320]   for a very long time.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.320]   So that just is it.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.040]   And that's why AOL starts buying stuff,
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   because they're pretty much dead in the mindset of what they do.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.120]   They've made themselves relevant.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.600]   You know, they may not be done.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.600]   They're making themselves relevant.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.160]   They're not done.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.440]   But I'm saying to that point of older companies
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.200]   they're not really doing that much as far as the AOL brand name.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.000]   They are buying things.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.680]   They do have properties underneath of them.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.480]   But I mean, when I tell people I still use AIM,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.400]   they laugh at me.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.440]   And I'm like, I'm not a producer.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   Essentially.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.920]   They do.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.320]   And I'm like, whoa.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.680]   What do you get used to AIM?
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.160]   What?
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:46.840]   Cool, man.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.360]   AIM.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.640]   TMZ and--
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.800]   What's wrong with ICQ?
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.140]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:50.800]   Come on, really.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.120]   Look, type of shit inside.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.840]   Nobody bothers me on AIM.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.880]   I got my high school friends on there,
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.920]   and I got close friends.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.160]   There's some big, important people, Uncle Leo,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.360]   that still use AIM.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.640]   No, I have an AIM account.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.520]   People come stop going and Skype and everything else.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.040]   Nobody's looking for your AIM.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.960]   Is AOL done making acquisitions?
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.320]   Gabor Vera's on Twitter last night saying a media--
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.000]   or yesterday I'm saying I'm meeting with AOL.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.920]   He's making a lot of noise.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   That tech meme.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.000]   Oh, that gave his fucking--
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   He's just fooling around.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.000]   He's just fooling around.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.480]   Gabe would be another smart purchase.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:19.800]   Wouldn't it?
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.560]   Because he owns--
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.280]   He'd be cheap?
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.120]   Well, that's where I look for my tech news every morning.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.720]   Every morning, part of my beach check, I go to GigaOM.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.760]   I go to Scobolizer.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.280]   I go to Techmeme.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.960]   I go to Odocta.com.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   It's part of my--
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   Here's--
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.880]   Oh, what do you think about this?
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.560]   Because I have my iPad in front of me.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.840]   I have 22,000 people flowing into my iPad.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.800]   And I can refresh it and read those people.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.840]   That's a huge disruption of itself, right?
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.960]   The fact that we can listen to people all over the world
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.840]   that we want to listen to, and we can see tens of thousands
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.120]   of them on the screen.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.600]   And--
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.960]   You know, I want to talk actually about--
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.800]   You're right.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.200]   And this is going to segue into Larry Lessig's really--
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.320]   I thought great article in the New Republic,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.440]   he published it on Saturday.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.680]   It's his-- not exactly review of the social network,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.440]   the Facebook film.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.280]   I think we should talk a little bit about that.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.200]   But he says that Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher,
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.760]   missed the point of what happened at Facebook.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.080]   And it's relevant to this point.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.280]   So I want to talk about that in just a second before we do.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.360]   I also want to talk about our friends at Ford
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.960]   and the incredible Ford Fiesta.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.760]   I thought we were going to talk about the Edge today,
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.960]   so I went out and drove the Edge.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.240]   I'll tell you what.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.560]   Ford is crushing it.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.480]   They are not going to out of the park.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.000]   I drive a 2010 Mustang.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.160]   Couldn't be happier.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.200]   This is a car that is solid.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:34.920]   It feels good.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.480]   It is great to drive.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.920]   And now they've got this incredible Ford Fiesta, 40 miles
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.760]   per gallon highway.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.040]   And it's not a hybrid.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.520]   It's not-- it's a gas engine.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.000]   40-- it's this 1.6 liter Dura-tech--
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.120]   you know, I'm going to say this because I always
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.440]   hate it when like Connie Chung says, that was the best dose.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.280]   And I'm going to be like that because I don't know anything
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.120]   about engines, but I'm going to read this.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.400]   Dura-tech T-I-V-C-T-I-4 engine.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.040]   Does that sound right?
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.080]   It's an-- I'll tell you what.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.920]   I got in the car.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.360]   I drove the Fiesta.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.480]   It is peppy.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.280]   It is so cute.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.280]   That's a little bit better to judge that.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.000]   It is so cute.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.680]   And it is a great car.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.920]   Standard features like the Easy Fuel Capitalist filter.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.440]   I've got that on my 2010 Mustang.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:22.960]   I love that.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.560]   You never lose the cap.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.840]   You just press the thing and it opens up.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.680]   And you put the thing in and the thing goes in the thing.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.000]   This is standard-- 4-inch multi-functional display
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.200]   with LCD screen.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.520]   Heated leather-- this optionally heated leather trim
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.040]   seats, power shifts, six-speed automatic transmission.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.160]   And my favorite-- and you've got to get this--
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.000]   the Ford Sync.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.880]   They call it my Ford Touch now.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.840]   The in-car communications and connectivity system.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.480]   Have you tried-- have you put it--
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:49.960]   you know--
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.720]   Well, now that you try the Ford Sync on the expensive Ford
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.520]   Sync, then they-- on the lower end cars--
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.680]   you don't-- they have--
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   still got GPS.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.280]   You got GPS over the--
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.440]   Just talks to you.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:00.840]   Fun life.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.600]   Talks to you.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.440]   You never take your hands off the wheel, your eyes off the road.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.280]   You're always in touch.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.120]   You can say what to play on music.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.160]   You can-- mind on Android.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.320]   It'll read my text messages.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:10.920]   It's pretty fun.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.400]   I got to record this so you can hear it.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.360]   I got somebody who sent me a dirty text message just
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.560]   to hear what it would sound like.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.160]   It's a female voice.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.800]   Oh, baby.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.440]   Oh, baby.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.480]   I love you.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.040]   It's great.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.880]   I was laughing all the way home.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.480]   I love my Ford Mustang.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.080]   You were sleeping on a couch for a week, right?
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.120]   Oh, no, it was my wife.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.120]   I got it.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.680]   Oh, baby.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.520]   Oh, baby.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.680]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.200]   Oh, oh.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.880]   That's a proof.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.480]   Oh, oh.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.640]   It's really-- it's just a marvelous car.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.560]   You got to give it a try.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.800]   The 2011 Ford Fiesta with a package that looks good.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.720]   And mileage, you won't believe it is.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.800]   I think-- let me check.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.560]   I think this-- I think EPA said this was the highest.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.120]   Estimated highway mileage of any compact car.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.480]   There's no other more fuel efficient compact car.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.680]   I presume that includes the hybrids.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.920]   40 miles to the gallon.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.000]   Drive one this week at a dealer near you.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.160]   And if you haven't seen the YouTube video,
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.920]   the Lamborghini versus Fiesta, go see that on YouTube.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.680]   It is hysterical.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.600]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.520]   Stop by a Ford dealer this week and drive the new 2011 Ford
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.240]   Fiesta.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.640]   I am.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.880]   I think I'm supposed to say this from the legal department.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.640]   EPA estimated 29 city 40 highway 33 compiled
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.560]   MPG automatic SFE.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.200]   I don't know what that means.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.040]   I know you are-- did you get to test drive that 2011 Mustang?
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.120]   Yeah, I did.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.080]   I was a Shelby.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.320]   You wanted to trade yours in, didn't you?
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:34.920]   I did.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.840]   You wanted to trade yours really badly.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.360]   See, they run those commercials, boy.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.880]   And I'm like, OK.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.000]   And you know the guys at Ford said we could arrange that.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.000]   Yeah, trade them.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.400]   Well, come on.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.120]   For a price.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.760]   Get that gas mileage up.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.240]   Come on, Uncle Leo.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.280]   It's nice.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.160]   Have you driven it?
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.360]   You're making bad money, man.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.000]   I just want to drive it.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   If you get it, I'll be able to drive it, at least
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.560]   around the block a couple of times.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.320]   And somebody told me, oh, no, those aren't America.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:17:59.880]   They're made in Brazil.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.040]   And I look, no, it was made in Michigan.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.320]   That is an American car, end-to-end,
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.080]   stremter stern.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.520]   It is so--
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.400]   I feel so good--
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:07.880]   30 miles highway.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.280]   You'll find--
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.040]   Supporting American industry and American workers.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.560]   I just feel like--
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.240]   And my target is made in America, too.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.080]   Well, I know nowadays it's all made in Tennessee.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.920]   Told, docked off.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.920]   It was by Chevy or something, too, right?
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.160]   You know, my wife, I am ashamed to admit, right now,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.960]   is driving a Toyota.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.720]   A highlander.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.640]   You got a highlander, right?
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.560]   We sold it.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.000]   Yeah, you know, I want to sell mine and get a flex.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.600]   Have you tried the flex?
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.120]   Although, she wants the edge now.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.840]   She said the edge is super high tech.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.200]   We have three kids, so we had to get the mini man.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.000]   Get the flex.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.720]   We got the yes.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.520]   Man, I'm just loving it.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.800]   Thank you for your support.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.600]   I shouldn't--
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.200]   My producer has a Mustang.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.540]   Does?
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.520]   Really?
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.320]   Who, a Rocky?
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.920]   Rocky's got good taste.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.080]   I always liked Rocky.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.240]   Somebody drove up next to me.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.040]   I'm driving down the road.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.880]   I have a 5.0 GT, right?
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.400]   It's not like-- it's eight cylinders,
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.480]   but it's not like the top line.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.120]   And somebody drives up in a Shelby Cobra, right?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   Like the top of the line Mustang.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.520]   And he guns his engine.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.280]   All I can do is go.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.440]   Yeah, and mine back.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:03.880]   That's it.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.600]   I'm not racing you, right?
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.840]   No, no need.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.440]   But it was fun.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.080]   It was the little Mustang club.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.960]   So first of all, Larry Lysig, Sejesus, Sejesus.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.280]   I mean, he's this smart guy.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.800]   Sejesus, the way I should say that after Little Blans,
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.640]   it's hard to say.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.480]   He's a jesus.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.840]   He wrote a-- he said, though, look, this is a great movie.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.200]   David Denby said it was a great movie.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.240]   I did not think it was a great movie.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.400]   You've seen the social network?
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.120]   It's a good movie.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.240]   By no means a great movie.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.720]   I don't need to see it again.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.560]   At all.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.080]   Like there's no urge in my life to see it again,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.120]   unless it's a Sunday rainy night, and on board,
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.680]   and someone else--
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.000]   I'll watch it on video.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I had two movies to see this week when it was social network.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.720]   The other was Waiting for Superman.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.280]   I decided to go see Waiting for Superman.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.640]   Now that-- I can't wait to see that.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.840]   It's all about charter schools.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.040]   It's so frustrating.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.000]   These poor kids, smart, nice kids
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.720]   have to wait in a lottery to get in to a decent school.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.040]   Otherwise, they're stuck with a crap school that's basically
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.400]   wasting lives.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.920]   Horrible.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.480]   That's something we got to do something about.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.840]   It's infuriating, and actually, they filmed two movies.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.120]   One was about innovative schools that are actually teaching.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.440]   And charter schools like Kip?
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.640]   Charter schools Kip and stuff like that.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.560]   And then they filmed the movie about how bad the education
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.400]   system is.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.720]   And three weeks before the Sundance Film Festival,
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.120]   they added the two movies together and made one movie.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.560]   And it's really interesting to see it ping pong back
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.440]   and forth between those.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.120]   We're going to kill this country if we do not take care
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.120]   of the kids and get them good educations.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.280]   We cannot succeed as a nation.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.400]   We cannot compete if these kids are not getting an education.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   Hey, Patrick, you were learning Chinese.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.040]   The biggest thing too is that I was telling somebody
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.480]   the other day.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.880]   And I said, we are a service country.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.320]   We don't create or build anything anymore.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.280]   People used to be mechanics, machinists.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.640]   I mean, everything we do, we export anything that actually
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.280]   gets done.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.080]   So even if you're not getting a good education,
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.480]   you're not learning a second language,
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.600]   you're also not learning a trade or a skill
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.040]   because there aren't trade and skill jobs for us to do.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.680]   I mean, we sit here and I can run my mouth and make money.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.720]   That's not really a skill.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.080]   If the world came falling down, I can't put it together,
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.880]   a car, or engineer anything.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.160]   And that's our real problem.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.480]   We don't build our own stuff.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.880]   We don't take care of our own.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.560]   We outsource everything for cheaper and better.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.280]   I mean, we don't even talk on our own phones anymore.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   We send it to India.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.440]   So I mean--
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.960]   I talk when I talk to--
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.840]   I'm on the board at my kid's school,
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.000]   private school, fancy private school.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.280]   And because the public school's here,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.800]   I don't dare send my kids to.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.040]   Actually, Patrick's in public school.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.120]   Patrick's a self-starter smart kid.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.880]   He can make his way through the public school here.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.640]   My Henry needs a little more attention.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.120]   I think that will him high as a great school.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.000]   That will him high as a great school for a kid like you.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.720]   But I think a lot of kids fall through the cracks
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.560]   at school like that.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.400]   And then there's no budget.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.200]   He listens to jazz music after all that.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.080]   He listens to yacko-pastorious.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.280]   Sounds like a disease.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:52.800]   I got yacko.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.000]   Does he even know who that is?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.120]   Home knows who that is, because home's like really--
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.360]   Home listens to great music.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.800]   What kind of music do you listen to?
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.960]   I listen to a lot of international jazz.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   I guess I listen to a lot of new age, electronic.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.440]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.120]   And then a lot of classic--
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.440]   See, oh, it's like me.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.400]   I love that sound.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.440]   I would just jazz?
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.040]   I love that.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.440]   I love listening to your version.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.720]   Your version's OK, but not Enya.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.360]   You listen to Enya.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.960]   Not Enya.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   I listen to folks like T-Recorp and Tusk.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.280]   And this is a little bit on the electronics I've seen.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.240]   OK, that's all right.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.080]   I do listen to a lot of old rock, old jazz.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.280]   Now the new stuff.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.560]   Now the new stuff is, you know, I'm that excited.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.960]   So where you watching, Neil Young?
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   I've been listening to Lady Gaga.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   You know what?
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.120]   That Lady Gaga, hey, she ain't so bad.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.160]   Did you see Neil Young last night on YouTube Live on Farm 8?
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.000]   Man, he was rockin'.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.600]   He's awesome.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.240]   And his new album is awesome.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.760]   Lady Gaga is just Madonna.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.960]   She's Madonna with me.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.920]   I don't know.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.720]   Madonna-- I don't know.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.680]   It seems like the same thing.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.200]   I just love Madonna and I was going up.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.000]   I was going up to Donna shut everything down.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.960]   I've been to the Cute.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   Little cheesy movie.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.200]   I mean Madonna did it all.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.480]   But you know what you're bringing up?
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.120]   And then by the way, we're going to actually continue
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.000]   the tech news in a moment.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.160]   But what you're bringing up here is the fact
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.880]   that whatever you grew up to, that's what's imprinted on.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.920]   You're like a little duck.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.040]   You're like a little baby duck.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.200]   It's whatever when you emerged into musical awareness,
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.480]   whatever was playing, that imprinted on your brain.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.880]   I like everything but country.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.880]   I love country.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.480]   I love country but country music.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.160]   But I do think that's what happens when I say it.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   It's because you trust the country.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   It's pretty cool.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.440]   Music is about what was going on while you were listening
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.440]   to that music.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.320]   Or what your parents played.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.800]   I listen to a lot of stuff from my dad.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.640]   He's played all the time.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.800]   Nobody plays anymore but he played it.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.880]   Rosemary Clooney.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.760]   Love that stuff.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.800]   My parents played that too.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.360]   I was born in the '60s.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.880]   You know what I said?
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.240]   My playlist right now, I've got tracks from the '50s, '60s,
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.800]   and '70s like all time greatest hits, 100 tracks each decade.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.880]   So I can get my history on them.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.120]   Patrick's is born in the '90s.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.360]   What the hell happened in the '90s?
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:02.920]   Jazz.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.920]   Jazz apparently.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.760]   Yaako was born in the year Mozilla was born.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.520]   Wow.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.520]   Now so he's the internet generation.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.320]   He's a digital generation.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:13.840]   Oh, totally.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.920]   He'll never know a world without the internet.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.960]   OK, so what do we do?
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.520]   And so what I'm telling our local high school
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.280]   is teach kids to be entrepreneurial, teach them.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.520]   They cannot, as we did, count on a job
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.600]   when they get out of school, they
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.760]   may have to make their own job.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.560]   However, the good news is, and this
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.720]   is the Larry Lessig article, there's never
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.840]   been a better time to be entrepreneurial.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.360]   He says the story, as a story about Facebook,
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.680]   the movie is deeply deep in thought.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   He says this after saying what a good movie is.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.120]   As I watched the film and considered what it missed,
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.160]   it struck me that there was more than a hint
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.120]   of self-congratulatory contempt in the motives behind how
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.960]   this story was told.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:59.440]   Imagine a jester from King George III's court charged in 1790
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.840]   with writing a comedy about the New American Republic.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.400]   That comedy would show the New Republic
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.920]   through the eyes of the old.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.160]   It would dress up the story with familiar figures
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.800]   and aristocracy or wannabe aristocracy with grand estates,
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.360]   but none remotely as grand as England.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.200]   The message would be fear not, there's no reason to go.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.080]   The new world is silly at best, deeply degenerate at worst.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.920]   And basically, that's what that movie was.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.440]   It was old media saying, don't worry about the internet.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.840]   It's a bunch of anti-social creeps.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.480]   They're fighting amongst themselves.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.360]   It was very anti-geek, it was very anti-woman.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.840]   But this is the thing.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.880]   And this is what I'd like your comment on.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.560]   Again, Larry Lessig writing in the New Republic.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.920]   The most frustrating bit of the social network is not,
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.520]   or is I should say, it's failure to even mention
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.680]   the real magic behind the Facebook story.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.760]   In interviews given after making the film,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.680]   Sorkin boasts about his ignorance of the internet.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.560]   Bosts, and Colbert, he said, I don't know, I think.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.200]   This ignorance shows, this is like a film
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.960]   about the atomic bomb, which never even introduces
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.000]   the idea that an explosion produced through atomic fission
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.960]   is importantly different from an explosion produced
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.880]   by dynamite.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.480]   What's important, and Zuckerberg's story,
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.840]   not that he's a boy genius, he plainly is, but many are,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.680]   not that he's a socially clumsy relative to the Harvard
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.520]   elite boy genius, every one of them is.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.400]   And it's not that he invented, it's not
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.400]   that he invented an amazing product through hard work
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.760]   and insight that millions love.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.120]   That's the history of American entrepreneurism
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.680]   from 1776 on with different technologies.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.280]   Instead, what's important here is that Zuckerberg's genius,
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.200]   this is the key, I know there's a lot of words,
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.240]   but this is the key.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.880]   Zuckerberg's genius could be embraced by half a billion,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.360]   could be embraced by half a billion people,
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.480]   within six years of its first being launched,
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.960]   without asking permission of anyone.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.040]   He didn't have to go to Harvard and said, can I start this?
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.800]   He didn't have to, he took a thousand dollar investment,
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.320]   he did not have to get permission,
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.360]   he did not have to work his way through a distribution system,
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.600]   he was able to start Facebook 'cause he felt like it,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.680]   'cause he thought of it, 'cause he could do it,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.520]   'cause he stole it, he didn't, and that's the other side
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.040]   of this that I hated about the movie.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   - I know, I'm just asking, when you have lost people,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.400]   you pay people money, I mean,
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.000]   yes, the Winklevoss, I'm just asking, I'm not done,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I'm not done, I'm just saying,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.120]   I have 100 ideas a day and they're worthless
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:25.960]   without execution.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.000]   - Look, at my space, was there,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.720]   Friendster wasn't the Winklevoss' invented social networking,
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.480]   those guys were greedy, Harvard elites.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.600]   - I just wanted to say it, because again,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.360]   people had to get paid money, so there's something to that.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.000]   - $60 million, I mean, and Lesik talks about that,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.600]   he says that's what's wrong with our system here,
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.760]   he says, 65 million, they didn't deserve $650, he says.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.200]   - And what about the guy who funded it,
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.560]   and he got squeezed out of it?
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.560]   - And they're part of the story, though,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.160]   you can't just talk about how amazing it is
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.080]   to be an entrepreneur, and not talk about the drabs
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.160]   and the trials and tribulations,
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.200]   that come along with me on a trip,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.120]   as soon as you get on top,
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.920]   everybody wants to take you down, Uncle Leo,
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.280]   you know what it is, I'm coming at you.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.840]   - Lesik says to his credit.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.600]   (laughing)
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.480]   - You're taking over, Leo, right?
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.560]   Me as Gobletron.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.400]   - We're kicking you out.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.200]   - I'll just leave, that's fine.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.360]   - I'm taking my-- - I'm spreading it,
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.200]   I'll be behind the credit.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.040]   - I'm taking my ball and I'm leaving.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.640]   - We're paying the cottage black, Lesik's--
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.120]   - Tomorrow.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.400]   - Lesik says to his credit,
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.200]   "Sorkin gives Zuckerberg the only lines
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.960]   "of true insight in the film."
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.240]   In response to the Winkwinkle-Voss lawsuit,
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.640]   he says, "Does a guy who makes a really good chair
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.920]   "ow money to anyone who ever made a chair?"
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.440]   Oh!
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.280]   And to his partner, to Eduardo,
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.440]   who signed away his ownership in Facebook,
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.280]   "You're gonna blame me 'cause you are business
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.880]   "head of the company and you made a bad business deal
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.120]   "with your own company."
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.480]   Which is true.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.640]   The point is, and it kinda goes back to the school issue,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.080]   is we have, this has been an amazing time,
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.520]   an amazing opportunity.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.360]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.560]   You know, I started in mass media
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.600]   when you had to get permission from somebody.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.200]   You had to go to a radio station owner,
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.120]   a television station owner, or a movie company.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.360]   He says, "Why don't the movie guy
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.320]   "should know this better than anybody?
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.680]   "The movie industry, you can't go one step
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.240]   "without permission from some idiot capitalist
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.320]   "who's holding the checkbook."
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.560]   And that's what's amazing about this internet generation
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.520]   is that you don't need permission, you just do it.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.960]   - And there, oh, we can talk about the venture stuff
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.800]   that's happening.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.520]   I've interviewed four startups this week,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.400]   all of whom are most of whom were funded by Y Combinator
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.560]   for $17,000.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.720]   - They don't need a lot of money.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.920]   And they could use EC3, they can use Amazon's EC3,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.680]   or Google code to create a website
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.760]   that's working with Raspace's OpenStack
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.200]   to create a demonstration of a viable thing.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.880]   I mean, you can really, isn't that true,
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.400]   and you can, today, more than ever,
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.320]   you can create and start your own thing
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.960]   without permission from anyone.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.160]   - Yes, you can start, and you can create
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.200]   without permission from anyone,
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.720]   but to grow a big, and grow into a big idea
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.480]   and a big company, you still need capital.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   I mean, that's what Facebook did.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.240]   Yes, they started very tiny and small,
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.960]   but they've, they've--
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.400]   - To me, well, you're talking about a Facebook or a Google,
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.320]   but look at, look at Errington, right?
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.280]   He didn't take any VC or Smugmug hasn't taken any funding,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.440]   outside funding, or GoPro.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.880]   - I haven't taken any outside funding,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.200]   I haven't taken any. - I haven't taken any.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.400]   - I think you, what you're trying to,
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.080]   there are two different scales, right?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.160]   Like, if you look at Facebook,
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.320]   to get to the scale where they are today,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.800]   they needed to take money.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.480]   - Yes, but they could get to a sufficient point
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.640]   to ask for money. - For money.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.480]   - To deserve the money.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.640]   - But with a thousand bucks.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.960]   - Absolutely, I think we need to always remember that,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.880]   that we can't really just say,
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.760]   you can start a big company,
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.960]   and then you don't need a lot of money.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.280]   I think on the internet, you still do.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.840]   And there is a lot of things which need to go right.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.240]   Like, where, between, you know,
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.080]   like for every Facebook and Twitter,
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.160]   there's a lot of companies that don't make it.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.720]   For every cat crunch,
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.840]   there's a lot of companies who don't make it, right?
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.640]   Let's not, let's not get too carried away
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   by the upside of the entrepreneurship, right?
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.240]   There is a downside to it.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.480]   But I do agree there is a lot of tools out there.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.200]   There's much easier, there are more standards.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.000]   The open source software is out there.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.280]   There's a lot of things which make it easy to go
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.440]   and start your--
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.000]   - You gotta agree there's more opportunity
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   than ever before. - Absolutely.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.200]   You know, the dream is a lot closer than you realize.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.960]   I mean, let's just put it that way.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.880]   - And that's what I would tell a high school kid today
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.480]   is you're not gonna probably graduate from college.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.320]   You gotta go to college,
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.280]   but you're probably not gonna graduate from college
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.280]   being approached by five recruiters from Dow Chemical
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.520]   and US Steel trying to get you in the junior executive suite.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.360]   You are gonna have to find something
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.040]   and you may have to make something for yourself
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.840]   and I don't think that's a bad thing.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.600]   If you're the smartest,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.560]   I worry about the, you know,
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.080]   that's the smartest third like Patrick,
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.200]   but I worry about the--
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.280]   - Well, you know, keep it on mind.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.080]   Facebook's hired 1200 people
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.800]   in the last five years.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.200]   - They're making, they are creating jobs.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.520]   - But they're hired with 300 people.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.280]   - That's nothing compared to the tens of thousands
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.120]   that are losing jobs. - It's nothing.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.720]   - 'Cause the industrial basis crumbling.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.040]   - That's true, but the future of work
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.840]   is in the high tech industry.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.600]   Or even if you work at a company like Oakley,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.560]   I went down and visited Oakley.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.040]   Most of the people who are adding value
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   are the people who have come up with a technical idea
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.720]   patent where, you know, a new idea to bring to them.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.000]   And that's the new world.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.120]   You have to-- - Then come up
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:36.960]   with something new.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.640]   - The economy will bounce out a little bit too
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   and that'll help people out.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.560]   I mean, back in 2001, you had everybody
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.360]   that was an email marketing specialist
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.400]   and then the economy bounced back a little bit
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.600]   and people went back to their jobs.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.440]   I mean, it went away.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.560]   Now everybody's a social media guru specialist
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.400]   living in the town of Spacemen.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.240]   - That's pathetic.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   - That's just pathetic.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.160]   - Come on, Leo is the social media.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.960]   - That's just pathetic.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.720]   - But all those people go away when the economy gets
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.600]   a little bit better and they'll go back and have a job.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.080]   You know, having forbid social media
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.920]   is giving people some money.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.760]   - Do people?
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.680]   - Do people at home do people as much as it's pathetic?
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.440]   I mean, people are making money from that
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.680]   and if you don't know how to drive a car, Leo,
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.800]   and I tell you how to drive a car,
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.600]   and you're getting a car and you're driving it so easy,
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.440]   but you didn't know how to drive a car.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.280]   - Oh, that's true.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.120]   - That's bad.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.160]   - So I mean, as much as you say, it's silly.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.440]   I mean, trust me, I'm in that industry a little bit.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.520]   I'm trying to get out of it fully,
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.960]   but there are people that don't know
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.400]   and they're willing to pay to learn.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.280]   And as long as you don't treat them like a little child and say,
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.480]   let me tweet for you because it's too hard.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.680]   You know, if you can just educate them
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.960]   and send them on their way, take your money and go,
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.800]   that's fine.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.080]   But the whole kid sitting in a room tweeting for you
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.960]   for a megacorp is kind of weird
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.600]   when you talk about authenticity.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.080]   - You know who gets short-shrift in this movie?
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.280]   - Sean Fanning.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.120]   - Yeah.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.240]   - 'Cause they don't ever mention Sean Fanning.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.520]   It's like Sean Parker invented Napster.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.480]   And Sean Fanning, the guy who wrote the code.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.800]   - Yeah.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.200]   - Who?
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.440]   It was Sean Parker, it was Justin Timberlake.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.640]   This is the...
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:02.640]   - That's the Hollywood version of reality, right?
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.160]   Like that's what they do.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.960]   - Even Sorkin admits we didn't attempt to be accurate here.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.160]   - Did you see the movie?
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.000]   - Yeah.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.840]   - Yeah.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.600]   The writing was, man, I tell you what,
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.680]   if everybody talked like that, I'd be happy.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.000]   - Nobody talks like that.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:15.920]   - I wish they did though.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.840]   That was, it was just...
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.200]   - I know, I love Sorkin's writing.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.040]   - I'm a big fan.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.960]   - The funny thing is I walked around Davos
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.560]   with a Zuckerberg for three hours.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.400]   - He doesn't talk like that.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.520]   - He doesn't talk like that.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.000]   And in fact, he's not even, he's not confident.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.760]   I tried to follow him into parties
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.560]   and he was like, I don't think I wanna go.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.760]   - I watch, so you and Oam have talked to Mark
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.600]   many times, I'm sure.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   I wish you'd seen the movie
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.080]   'cause I'd love to know, is this anything like
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.800]   the Mark Zuckerberg you know?
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.960]   - Just based on the, I've read a lot of reviews and stuff.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.520]   And I've seen the trailers and no.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.920]   - In the movie, he was like anti-social, whatever, nervous.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.000]   But he was also a pimp.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.240]   Like there was a part where the lawyer was just like,
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.160]   do I have your full attention?
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.200]   And he's like, - No, I was good.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.640]   - He's like, no, actually you don't.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.560]   You deserve the minimalist about my attention.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.560]   - I love that. - And that's what you're gonna get.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.400]   - Great job. - And that's what
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.240]   I can give you right now.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.320]   Does that answer your question?
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.640]   Your snide question?
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.880]   And I'm like, gee, that's what you, and then...
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.200]   - Yeah, Mark's not been like that.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.760]   - Yeah, no, I mean, like he was cutting people
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.640]   at the knees left and right
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.040]   and not even looking at him in the eyes when he did it.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.400]   I'm like, if he talk like that, I wanna be his friend.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.800]   I don't care if he doesn't like people.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.000]   I don't care if he cuts his heads off a chicken.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.080]   - Now, he earned two round of heads.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   - Does talk like that.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   (laughing)
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.040]   - It was very well written, very, very well.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.400]   - Well, of course.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.000]   I mean, that's Aaron's story.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.680]   - And fiction is always very well written.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.160]   - Yes, that's the point.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.240]   I was just saying, I wish I lived in a world like that.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.320]   - I think in 10 years, he's gonna appreciate the movie
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.640]   being made 'cause he's gonna be like bigger than life
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.120]   because of this movie.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.920]   The patina of this movie is gonna stick to him a little bit.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.960]   And people will think he's the biggest, like you said, pimp.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.160]   - I didn't think it was so negative about him, to be honest.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.960]   I thought it was neutral about him.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.240]   It's almost you couldn't really figure it out.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.160]   I mean, one thing that the movie is a total lie
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.680]   is it implies that he created Facebook
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.040]   'cause he had his girlfriend jilted him.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.080]   Which is a lie.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.920]   I mean, he has--
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.760]   - He's still with the same girl.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.600]   - He's with the same girl.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.440]   - Maddie and Harvard, right?
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.280]   - Right.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.200]   - The other thing that come about that part of it was,
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.360]   it's like there's no real villain.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.800]   It kind of like it made everyone seem like they were just bad.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.720]   - All the geeks are bad.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.480]   In fact, Larry Lesk says, the heroes are little ears.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.440]   Evil little nerds out to get each other.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.400]   Nobody cares about anything but money.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.200]   And that's what it seemed like.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.120]   I'm like, as soon as you start feeling bad for somebody,
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.400]   you're like, man, he's a--
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.360]   - Oh, no, no, that's exactly the point.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.240]   - Yeah, so there's no real villain--
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.000]   - But they did nail-- - They didn't attach to.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.520]   - On that point, they did get close.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.440]   'Cause he does care about owning his business.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.280]   And having his role.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   - Oh, that's, it seemed like that's all he cared about.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.440]   It seemed like he was a machine,
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.120]   and all he cared about was his program.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.680]   Screw everybody else, screw friendship, screw love.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.840]   I never called my parents and said,
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.520]   hey dad, I made Facebook, nothing.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.440]   There's no emotional attachment.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.800]   - You know, you never even meet his parents.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.240]   - No, I'm just saying, there's nothing--
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.320]   There's nothing that attached to him to make him
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.760]   care about anything other than anger and--
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.320]   - Tell us about the Mark Zuckerberg you know, Robert.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.800]   - He was just, if he didn't start Facebook,
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.640]   he would be a geek that would be sitting here.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.760]   - We all know this geek.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.960]   We all know him.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.880]   He's the guy we know.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.480]   That's kind of what I saw in that movie is like,
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.000]   you know, I think people assume, oh, he's, you know,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.520]   he's always manipulating people in his head.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.360]   He's so smart.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.200]   He's running rings around and I just saw a kid
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.880]   who was just didn't really want to deal with anything.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.440]   - No, if anything, he understands how people work
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.120]   and he understood the features he needed to add to Facebook
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.760]   to get people locked in. - He did, didn't he?
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.600]   - Right?
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.320]   He took psychology, he told me he took psychology in college,
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.160]   right?
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.200]   And he studied how people work and what did he need to do
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.080]   to hook people in and make his system viral?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.120]   - Here's Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.800]   his interview earlier this year with Diane Sawyer.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.480]   - He able to stay apart and building that.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.080]   - As with any creation myth,
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.520]   it's been hard to separate the facts from the legend.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.680]   Just who built it along with him?
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.920]   How much of the company they're entitled to?
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.720]   - Wow, there's a woman.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.800]   There were no women except Skanks and Hoes in that movie.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.080]   - Settled months over the years.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.280]   - It was very anti-woman.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.440]   - Closely said them, man.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.320]   - Yeah, no, it was very not a very positive
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.400]   for trailer women.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.240]   - So do we, one person.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.680]   - One person in the film handed a folder
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.440]   so don't get upset about the women to play in the movies.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.040]   - Social network.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.480]   - Your actions could permanently destroy
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.320]   everything I can work in.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.320]   - We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,
