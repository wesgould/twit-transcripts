[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.360]   This weekend tech show that covers the latest tech news
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.000]   with journalists from across the world and around the nation,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.200]   starting with in the upper center square to block.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.240]   It's Barretunde Thurston.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hey, Barretunde.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400]   Good to have you back on the show.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.520]   Good to be here from Brooklyn.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.360]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.240]   It's representing Brooklyn from barretunde.com.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.000]   He's also the web editor, political editor,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.280]   for The Onion Magazine and a host of Popular Sciences Future
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.560]   of Show on the Science Channel.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.600]   And always glad to have you on.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.440]   Always good to be here.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.760]   Do you have a show tonight?
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.080]   You don't have a show tonight.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.160]   I don't have to rush to get you out of here, right?
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.520]   No, no, I'm good to go.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.720]   I've got a web 2.0 talk later this week,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.320]   but hopefully it will be done by Wednesday.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.000]   OK, I know that feeling.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.960]   Jeff Jarvis is stuck around, which
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.240]   is very nice from this week in Google's show.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.280]   And he's well-piggled.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   Fresh as a daisy.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.480]   It's good to have you, Jeff, from buzzmachine.com,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.960]   one of the really great commentators
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.400]   on the future of journalism.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.880]   For that, why get a book plug, Leo?
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.400]   And a book?
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.360]   We forgot to plug the book on the Twig show.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.960]   Yeah, you could plug it in.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.280]   That's OK.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.760]   I got trouble there, but this is a new bunch of sufferers.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.840]   The book is, "What Google Do?"
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.200]   And available better bookstores also is an audible book.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.080]   And on the Kindle?
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.640]   Yes.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.520]   On the Kindle, too.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.440]   That's fantastic.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.160]   Great to have you back, Jeff.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.240]   And in the lower right-hand corner to block,
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.960]   it is Mr. John C. Dvorak.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.200]   Is that a twit hat you're wearing?
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.160]   No, I don't think so.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.240]   I couldn't be so blessed.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.080]   What are you wearing there?
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.080]   What's that hat?
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.200]   Just a hat.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.800]   Just a hat.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.240]   It says, "Alumni for the Evergreen State College."
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.520]   Well, that's great.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.000]   Apparently, they don't know the difference
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.440]   between alumnus and alumna.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.280]   And why would they?
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.040]   They don't think they don't do "Ladley Latin" at Evergreen.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.680]   Great to have all three of you on the show today.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680]   Don't forget channeldvorak.com.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.800]   I almost forgot the plug.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.520]   Can't do that.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.960]   Channeldvorak.com.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.400]   Boy, this was the week.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.720]   Why don't you must be a gamer?
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.960]   I'm guessing Baratunde, you might play a gamer, too.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.600]   You as the youngest person on the show today.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.960]   I play a little bit.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.600]   I just got an Xbox 360 a few months back,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.000]   and I play Left 4 Dead and burn out.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.480]   I haven't played the modern warfare college.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.880]   You gotta go get modern warfare, too, baby.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.640]   Join the crowd, the largest, according to at least
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.720]   to the Infinity War, the creator of the game,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.160]   the largest media launch of all time,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.920]   4.7 million copies sold.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.800]   I mean, huge revenue, $310 million,
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.960]   bigger than any movie launch, bigger than the biggest movie
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.280]   of all time, Dark Knight, which was last year, twice as big
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.560]   as the Dark Knight first weekend.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.240]   This is in one day, by the way.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.120]   One day sales, bigger than the biggest record album out there,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.920]   even bigger than the last big video game, which was last year,
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:53.040]   was Grand Theft Auto 4, a huge $310 million sale in one day
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.640]   in the UK and North America.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.640]   And--
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.200]   Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.320]   No, you finished the sentence.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.520]   I wanted to talk about these numbers,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.440]   because it's always very popular for people
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.400]   to say video game releases are bigger than movies.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.800]   But what's always left out of those stories,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.520]   at least in the leave of those stories,
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.000]   is that they cost $60 a pop.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.760]   Right.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.480]   So if you're just talking revenue, yeah.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.000]   Like Dark Knight did at least three times as much,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.280]   because the movie tickets aren't yet $60,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.200]   which they don't get it.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.760]   But Dark Knight is a two-hour commitment.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.960]   And that's what a 40-hour commitment is like a job, right?
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.760]   It's the rest of your life.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.160]   It's like a job.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.320]   In fact, you guys at the Onion--
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.840]   The job?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.480]   I hate it, too.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.880]   You guys at the Onion did a very funny modern warfare three.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.760]   Yeah, ultra realistic modern warfare game
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.640]   features awaiting orders and repairing trucks.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   That was about five weeks ago.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.040]   It was just shows guys like fixing their Humvees
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.840]   and like waiting for them to come down,
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.200]   guarding, green zone.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.560]   It was really a very, very funny piece.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.840]   I think that the Onion News Network is so realistic.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.200]   Are those real news people that they use on those?
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.560]   That's a great question.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.360]   Some of them are.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.800]   So we've had Bobby Batista, a former CNN reporter
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.720]   reporting for us.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.560]   The most realistic people come for the morning show,
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.360]   which we call today now, which parodies Good Morning
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   America--
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.860]   Right.
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.840]   --earnly show with all these sunshiny people who are creepily
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.680]   happy.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.840]   And we found that actors couldn't be creepy enough.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.200]   They just did the--
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.920]   They had to have a real morning news anchor
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.280]   to get that disconcerting sense of positivity.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.600]   Only someone trained to do it.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.880]   You have to be a trained professional.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.760]   It's not acting.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.800]   It's something else.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.240]   I don't know exactly what it is.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.680]   It's just being.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.360]   It's truly amazing.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.240]   Leo, can the two of us get on that show?
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.160]   We should do it.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.400]   Oh, we could be creepily happy.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.680]   What do you think, John?
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.640]   Hey.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.120]   Hey.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.520]   Happy talk news.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.800]   I think that's a good idea, John.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.480]   Maybe we got something.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.200]   It's really funny because it's uncanny.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.720]   It looks like the real thing.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.240]   Just uncanny.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.720]   Be careful, or Onion will do a version of "Twint."
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.600]   No, it's not--
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.760]   That's how you made it.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.080]   We're not well known enough, exactly.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.040]   They haven't already?
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.200]   No, no.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.360]   When that happens, I will say, man, see, mom?
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.640]   I'm in the onion now.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.760]   Anyway, huge success.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   But you made a very good point.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.040]   If you talk about unit sales, it's not close to the Dark Knight.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.520]   But still--
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.480]   I think it speaks to people's desire to be in the story
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.240]   more than watch somebody else's vision of a story unfold.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.120]   It's interactive, it's collaborative.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.600]   You're playing with your friends.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.360]   All these things are harder to do in a movie theater.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.880]   You're just sitting there watching someone else's vision unfold.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.160]   This, you get to be a part of that unfolding.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.520]   It really pissed off PC gamers, though.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.640]   I had a PC gamer call a radio show saying,
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.080]   you got to dance with the one that brung you.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.680]   We made Call of Duty the successful franchise it is.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.320]   And on this one, they decided--
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.640]   in Finany Wars, decided not to have dedicated servers, which
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.400]   is something apparently PC gamers really count on.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.880]   And in Finany Wars, response to this was, well, first of all,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.680]   that's a small number of people.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.880]   And in fact, I guess the success of the sales shows that it is.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.960]   And we decided that we wanted to improve the experience
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.320]   of the participants.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.240]   They said, given the choice between making
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.720]   a small number of hardcore gamers happy
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.480]   and improving the overall experience for everyone,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.960]   we're just prioritizing the player experience
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.560]   above the modders and the tuners.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.440]   So Jason West is one of the heads of Infinity Ward.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.160]   He says, the cheating, the insular communities,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   the skill level disparities, we're making the game fractured.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.440]   It's true, when you go on one of these dedicated servers,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.680]   you die immediately.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.840]   Instantly.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.800]   He said, maybe we thought maybe it'd be cool if the fans could
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.600]   play the game.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.000]   But boy, there's a petition online, 200,000 plus people
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.120]   sign it saying, bring back the dedicated servers.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.680]   I don't know if that's too inside baseball for us to discuss.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.040]   Every time I've tried now to talk about this three different
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.120]   times, and each time the PC guy said, no, no, you're getting
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.480]   it wrong.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.840]   You're getting it wrong.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.240]   From the link that you had on the delicious feed,
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.360]   it sounds like the big benefit was,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.840]   A, you could have a private match going on.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.960]   But more importantly, you could modify the game and create
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.120]   your own rules.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   And that level of user-generated innovation and building on
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.800]   the platform of the game is where a lot of these web tools
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.600]   tend to take us.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.440]   You can do whatever you want on top of their system.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.400]   These were all violations of the terms of service, of course.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.080]   And apparently, it reduced the quality of the game
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.760]   players for some other people.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.320]   So the people who owned the game were like, sorry, hardcore
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.160]   fans who made us who we are.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.040]   We're big now.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.880]   We don't need you anymore.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.520]   But the other issue that they don't bring up is that it
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.040]   prevents piracy, because if you control the servers, you
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.280]   block people who don't have legitimate copies, they say
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.000]   60% of the players were using illegal copies.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.200]   But maybe this is the real reason.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.040]   And this is from an article that Fopo Gijo just sent me
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.320]   from computer and video games.com.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.400]   Activision says, you should expect paid for online models,
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.360]   such as those in World of Warcraft, where you pay a
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   monthly fee to make the transition to other games,
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.120]   including Call of Duty.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.360]   So it may be what they're saying is, we don't want you to
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.240]   run servers because we want to charge you a monthly fee
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.640]   to play online.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.480]   You're already playing that with Xbox Live.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.600]   I mean, they make a monthly fee off of it, so it makes sense
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.840]   that they do the same thing to PC players.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.720]   That's really what's going on there.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.640]   Money, money, money.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.920]   Well, you know, I guess in one way you can't blame them,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.280]   because that's their business.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.320]   But on the other hand, you made $310 million in the first day.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.720]   Maybe you should just let them have servers.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.680]   That's old news, Leo.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.680]   That's last week's news.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.240]   We want to make money this week and next week and the week
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.600]   after we can't sell the game again.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.840]   So we just slice it up into monthly installments.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.720]   It's like a layaway plan for the game.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.240]   Yep.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.760]   Pretty soon they'll charge interest on these monthly plans.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.920]   Hey, I want to take a break.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.120]   We're going to come back in just a second to talk about why
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.400]   text ads work better than all those blinky ads you see.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.280]   But right now I want to tell you about my car.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.240]   My phone mustang.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.320]   Did you guys see it out front?
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.000]   Isn't that sweet?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.680]   Isn't that sweet?
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.280]   OK, but actually the ad is not for my car.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.400]   It's for the stuff in the car.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.840]   It's for the Ford Sync.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.000]   This thing is amazing.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.320]   Microsoft showed this.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.240]   I remember a couple of years ago at CES.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.240]   And I, you know, at the time I thought, well, that's kind of cool.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.680]   But when I started using it, I realized, wow, this is incredible.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.160]   It's a hands-free system for not just for your phone.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.960]   I mean, yeah, you've got, of course, all the Bluetooth
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.800]   features you look for.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.000]   But it also lets you talk to the car.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.120]   And it's like Kit Knight Rider.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.440]   I feel like David Hasselhoff when I get in that thing.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.320]   I say things like--
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.560]   I press a button on the wheel, by the way.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.840]   You don't need to look down.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.080]   You just press a button on the wheel.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.400]   And I say directions.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.840]   And it says directions.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.320]   Where to?
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.240]   And I'll say Starbucks.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.800]   And it'll tell me the way to the Starbucks.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.760]   There's no screen.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.800]   There's a little LED screen.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.360]   But this is not a GPS, like the big GPS system.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   You pay thousands of dollars for it.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.440]   This is the Ford Sync system.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.800]   You can say, read text messages.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.440]   And if you have a compatible phone,
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.640]   it'll read you your text messages.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.160]   You can say, read me the front page of the New York Times.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.280]   It'll read you that.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.360]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.640]   It has 911 assist.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.440]   So if you get in an accident, the airbags are deployed.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.920]   It calls 911.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.600]   It plays a recorded message.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.520]   It gives you the chance, of course, to override it,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.400]   if you decide you don't want to make that call.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.120]   And then it turns the microphone on in the car.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.080]   So you can talk to 911.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.880]   If 911, and more and more of them are unable to do this,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.560]   has GPS capability, it will send them
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.400]   the exact GPS location so the emergency crew
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.000]   can go right to where you are.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.200]   Vehicle health report.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.720]   I have it set to send me one every 5,000 miles.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.080]   But at any time, I can just say, send me a vehicle health
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.680]   report.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.320]   The car tells me the status of all the systems.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.280]   I can just go on and on.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.440]   You get personalized sports.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.640]   If you're in a-- if you've got a fantasy league,
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.600]   you actually get your fantasy results.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.600]   All of it without looking away from the road,
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.120]   with your hands on the wheel, both hands on the wheel,
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.800]   it is amazing.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.320]   Even personalized traffic reports,
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.360]   because it knows your route to school or work.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.240]   You could say, play Twitch.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.880]   And if you've got-- you have to, of course,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.960]   have Twitch on your device.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.080]   But if you've got Twitch on your MP3 player,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   it'll play it.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.560]   And I mean, it's amazing.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.640]   This thing is-- it's like Knight Rider.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.880]   The future's here.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.680]   I want you to take a look at it the next time you're
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.080]   going to afford Lincoln and Mercury dealer.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.040]   I say, I want to see the sink.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.360]   And here's your chance to win a free nano or zoom

[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.160]   Just tweet, just tweet something like, listening to Twitter.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.400]   I'm in the Twit cottage listening to Twit
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.320]   with Baratunde and Devorak and Jarvis.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.660]   And then put the pound sign and sink my ride podcast.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.440]   It's all one word.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.320]   Pound, sink my ride podcast.

[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.520]   or zoom your choice.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.840]   They're given away 15 of each between now and December 8.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.280]   And all you have to do to enter is tweet.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:34.920]   See, he's doing it.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.600]   Look at that.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.240]   He's smart man.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.520]   He's doing it on his Android.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.560]   And you're using the keyboard.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.920]   That's interesting.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.360]   You find that keyboard usable?
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.720]   No, he's saying no.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.360]   Sink, but get it right now.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.960]   That's why NCNYRID podcast.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.220]   And we thank Ford and the great sink.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.420]   By the way, I bought the car.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.060]   Ford did not buy the car.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:58.980]   Did you get a good price?
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.340]   I hope?
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.300]   No.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.180]   I'm faithless.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.500]   So I went to a Mercury dealer and asked to see this sink.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.220]   And they sent me to the bathroom.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.540]   You spelled it wrong.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.940]   You guys say it's wrong.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.740]   That's why NCNYRID.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.540]   So no.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.340]   All these extra capabilities, does the car still
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.100]   function as a vehicle to transport you from A to B?
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.860]   Or is it just everything else in life?
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.760]   I don't need your--
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.120]   So how do you do it there?
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.160]   Exactly.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.720]   You're just in the parking lot all day.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   You're watching television.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   Giant and person PC.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.160]   You're inside of it now.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.440]   It is so cool.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.080]   The one I got-- not all of them have this,
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.280]   but the one I got has a hard drive in it.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.880]   Did you get the Shelby 500?
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.000]   No, I almost did, John.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.120]   I came close, but I got the next one down.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.520]   The GT--
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.520]   The Cobra?
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.360]   No, that didn't get a Cobra.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.320]   I got the GT premium.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.440]   Well, the Shelby 500 I think is better than the Cobra.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.200]   And then there's the GT.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:45.720]   No, they're the same.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.560]   There's a GT 500--
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:46.800]   No, no, no.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.640]   I think it has a Cobra.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.740]   We're playing midlife in the Shelby 500.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.360]   It's not my midlife crisis, Jeff.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.860]   I want to be very clear about this.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.260]   It's my second childhood, OK?
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:55.940]   That's what I'm telling you about.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.820]   You're the convertible?
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.140]   No.
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.700]   Well, man, you disappoint me here.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.220]   But it's bright, candy, apple, red.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.420]   John, I'll take you for a ride.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.260]   It's beautiful.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:03.620]   It is so beautiful.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.140]   That's a ticket getter.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.540]   I know.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.380]   It is insane.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.060]   Come here.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.100]   I'm here.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.380]   But it's got a V8.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.220]   It's got so much power.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.020]   And it's so much--
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.180]   It's got a V8.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.940]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.140]   Leo.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:16.940]   V8.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.500]   Leo.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.000]   Green Leo has got a V8 now.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.480]   Hey, I got 20 miles to the gallon when I--
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.120]   You didn't even get the V8 Lexus engine when you had a Lexus.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.640]   No, I know.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   Now you're getting a V8?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.760]   What changed?
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.120]   I don't commute anymore, John.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.640]   I just drive it.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.320]   He just sits at it and don't--
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.600]   I just sit in and listen.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.520]   You start the engine up and gun it.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.080]   I do.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.400]   I have to admit, when I pull up, just
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.320]   to make the staff crazy, I gun it.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.840]   And we got the license plate.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.400]   I've ordered it.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.020]   It hasn't come yet.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.100]   It says "Twit TV" on the license plate.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.600]   It's going to be--
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.860]   No, uh-oh.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.360]   What?
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.500]   We're talking stalkers now.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.320]   Everybody know.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.040]   Four people are in the studio.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.360]   Just showed up.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.600]   Stalkers.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.320]   They just showed up.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:00.920]   How did you find it?
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.020]   I understand one of the couples there is a--
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.640]   Honeymoon in there.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   Honeymoon in the studio for that reason alone.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.720]   Ben and Chris Patterson got married two days ago.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.520]   Can I say who you work for, Ben?
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.840]   I work for--
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.200]   You work for who?
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.600]   Pintare Pool Products.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.880]   Why does it say Salesforce?
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.200]   Because I'm the administrator first.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.960]   Oh, I've been saying Salesforce.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.320]   What is it, Pintare?
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.400]   Pintare, P-N-T-A-I-R.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.760]   Pool Products in North Carolina.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.040]   And his poor wife is--
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.360]   No, she's a geek too.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.040]   They're both here.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.000]   And it's great.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.640]   On their honeymoon.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   Is it your home that you have the secret bedroom upstairs?
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.040]   Maybe they could take a break during one of the commercials.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.520]   We do have a futon.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.840]   Or do you want to bed and breakfast over there too?
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.240]   It used to be a bed and breakfast.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.720]   There's a-- there's a clawfoot tub.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.280]   Next time-- when you come out, Jeff, I got to show you.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.600]   Is a clawfoot tub upstairs just made for honeymooners?
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.760]   Honeymooners-- I just want to clarify.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.560]   They took their honeymoon to Twit.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.480]   Did you twit out?
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.760]   It's a detour.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.600]   It's a detour from the honeymoon.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.080]   Like, that would be great for Twit.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.760]   It's a little weird for them is what you said.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.760]   Yeah, weird for them.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.680]   Great for the show.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.040]   We'll tell everybody that.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.560]   They are not the first honeymooners to come here,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.960]   to be honest with you.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.920]   So we're going to do any news today.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.840]   Just curious.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.000]   Yahoo pulls the plug after 14 years on GeoCities
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.640]   founded in 1995.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.760]   Yahoo bought it in 1999.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.880]   Seven million of the internet's first websites
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.080]   lost forever.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.160]   Are we sad?
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.840]   Do we know how much they paid for it originally?
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.040]   I could find out.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.840]   And then we need to know how much they paid for it
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.800]   and then how much money they lost running it.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.280]   This is another one of those great Yahoo moments, right?
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.480]   You know, I don't want to plug the book here,
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.880]   but I say in there that Yahoo is the last old media company
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.120]   and they asked the question,
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:47.960]   what are we really?
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.920]   And they gave the wrong answer.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.720]   They said, where show is?
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.160]   What they really were at AOL too,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.040]   was Facebook before there was Facebook.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.880]   Right.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.760]   And why they had an opportunity to create.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.120]   They dropped a ball more often than punchline.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.760]   Come on, comic.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.520]   Hi, it's all time order.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.280]   I don't follow sports involving balls of any guy.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.600]   Yeah, I'm with you here as a man.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.760]   There's number three with a week six.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   They paid more for GeoCities than they did for broadcast.com.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.360]   Yep, that's 3.6.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.360]   That's why both people is a happy guy.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.720]   And more than what it's believed.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.240]   They want more record of this transaction.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.360]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.880]   More than YouTube.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.680]   He's got me pissed away more money than it.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.640]   It's unimaginable.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.360]   But they were spending funny money
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.760]   because it was, you know, they're sock IPO, right?
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.880]   Danny Sullivan reported in February to 1999.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.920]   Three million.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   Unbelievable.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.320]   3.6.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.680]   Don't forget the point six.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.600]   I'd take 6.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.840]   That's a lot of money than that point.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.480]   600 million here or there.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.640]   Does that really matter?
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.360]   I'll tell you what I would call it.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.320]   Probably about 10.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   I got a friend in the grad school at CMU
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.440]   and we've been talking about how do you document
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.920]   the Internet's history?
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.320]   And if you're looking, you know, 10, 15 or 100 years from now,
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.080]   how will we record this period and how will we share it?
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.920]   Will there be installations?
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.360]   And I think the sad part for me,
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.000]   which is a little tragic, is that they just deleted it.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.240]   It's not like storage costs, anything.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.120]   There's no technical reason why this can't just sit there.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.320]   You know, as part of our collective history
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.800]   of this new fantastic and crazy media.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.280]   Buy a 1.5 terabyte drive for 112 bucks.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.480]   Yeah, you could have it.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.320]   We don't have our own copy of Geo City.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.400]   I mean, it couldn't be more than a terabyte and a half.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.840]   I mean, those sites, right?
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.120]   I mean, it can't be that much.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.640]   You know, I think it make a good point.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.240]   We could have our own Geo City or somebody could have just
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.400]   said you could have just turned it over to some, you know,
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.040]   like archive.org and kept the thing going forever.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.400]   Well, that's people were upset.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.640]   So how did that happen?
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.360]   I mean, we're in the age of transparency and everybody
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.400]   knew this was coming.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.440]   Nobody ran over with a thumb drive to the Geo City's headquarters
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.840]   and just said, wait a minute, let me pop you that first.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.040]   Let's put it on a thumb drive.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.080]   All right, seven million sites.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.680]   Let's assume that the site, the average site is a megabyte, right?
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.120]   Probably most of us know.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.760]   That's too low.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.880]   Oh, smaller.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.840]   Oh, yes, smaller.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.840]   You think they're more than a megabyte?
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.760]   People say they saved their photos.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.160]   And there's a lot of ways to--
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.960]   Five space.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.480]   OK.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.680]   All right.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.320]   Assume a gigabyte, then it's still only seven terabytes,
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.600]   which you can buy at Costco.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.360]   For $50.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.400]   $75 a terabyte.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.560]   So I mean, it's not that much.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.080]   You're talking about $500 a month.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.520]   They're all forever.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.280]   They just lower the price of their storage.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.800]   You can put it on your Gmail account.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.840]   You're really good.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.680]   Or a good email account.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.760]   That's just said of a bunch of Gmail accounts.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.040]   So there is--
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.800]   tell me in the chat room, there is this site called riosities,
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.640]   r-e-o-cities.com.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.960]   Here lies, it says, what we could salvage
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.040]   from the ashes of GeoCities.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.240]   So maybe, apparently, they've saved some of it?
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.720]   I don't know.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.560]   Question is, do we want to?
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.280]   I think no matter how ugly it's part of us,
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.320]   we have to look back and learn from our history
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.440]   and say, never again.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   Never again.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.240]   Never again.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.440]   Never again.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.240]   And take a look at this.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.000]   HTML1.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.760]   HTML1?
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.240]   Is that what it's written in?
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.520]   No, I mean, I'm sure most of the sites are in HTML1.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.480]   Are they all gray?
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.320]   Gray background, that gray netscape gray background.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:37.800]   Remember that?
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.000]   Oh, that was ugly.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.560]   You know, I thought it was all ugly.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.320]   GeoCities is the beginning.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.560]   It's probably all better looking than MySpace.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.560]   Speaking of MySpace, should we bring up the Rupert Murdoch
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.800]   story, Jeff?
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.640]   Oh, what the hell.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:59.320]   Rupert Murdoch, a paragon of brilliance in the media,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.280]   the old media, has decided that Google is just
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.400]   a bunch of plagiarists.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.120]   They're stealing my content.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:08.440]   And--
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.840]   Get off the lawn, you kids.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.920]   Get off of my lawn.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.680]   I'm trying to run a newspaper here.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.760]   And what are they doing?
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.120]   They're nothing.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.240]   So he's decided that when is this going to be next year
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:19.720]   or some time?
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.240]   They're going to--
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   Yeah, sometimes.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.840]   Pull himself off the--
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.440]   They're going to go--
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.800]   Hey, wall, and then they're going to threaten
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.440]   to pull out of Google.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.680]   Yeah, sure.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.640]   I'm going to pull out.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.960]   Let's take-- let's put a pull together.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.080]   I'm bet on that one.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   Yeah, there's no way.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   Oh, I'll give you one penny on that one.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.200]   It's not going to happen.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.000]   It's just macho sword waving.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.320]   Posturing, posturing, to where--
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.920]   Negotiation tactics here.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.880]   What is this?
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.880]   Well, they are renegotiating the $300 million deal for MySpace
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.080]   that Google did.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.040]   And MySpace didn't earn their end of the bargain.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.960]   What was the deal that was a search deal?
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.480]   It was an ad guarantee deal.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.240]   And so if they got a sort of amount of traffic they had to get,
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.400]   they'd get $300 million from Google.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.120]   And I wish I had this in front of me.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.000]   I don't-- I think it came in something
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.480]   like $100 million short.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.720]   Wow.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.080]   MySpace just dying on the vine is kind of sad.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.920]   I don't know what to do.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.000]   I'm going to take MySpace behind the paywall.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.800]   So what is the--
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.520]   I went through Murdoch's prior disasters on the internet.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.400]   I worked for Delphi internet, which was actually
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.440]   was the first consumer service to bring the internet
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.480]   to anybody.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.760]   And then that morphed into something called iGuide, which
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.480]   was a terrible disaster, millions of dollars, huge,
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.200]   loft space in Manhattan, now empty.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.560]   And everybody forgets Murdoch has had many disasters
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.360]   on the internet.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.320]   I remember that iGuide.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.040]   He built a newsroom that was stunning.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   It was beautiful.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.440]   Did it ever go online?
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.960]   I mean, did anything ever happen?
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.000]   It did, but briefly.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.680]   Then they changed strategy about 10 times.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.520]   And they became TV Guide Online.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.600]   That's a good idea.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.400]   And then died a terrible death the way
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.520]   the whole company might now.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.720]   I'm being bitter.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.280]   I worked for them.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.000]   They were fine.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.320]   And they were smart people.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.880]   But they don't know the internet.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.920]   Michael Wolf said that Rupert Murdoch, a year ago,
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.560]   had never used Google.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.320]   A year ago.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.240]   But in a way, it's great.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.800]   Now that Strom Thurmond is gone and some of the other paragons
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.520]   of the earlier centuries are gone,
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.680]   we need somebody like that.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.960]   We don't have Senator Stevens to kick around anymore.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.240]   The internet needs people like Rupert Murdoch.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.880]   Those are my pipes.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.080]   Is the idea of pulling out of sort of blocking Google's crawler
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   that they will make a deal with another search engine?
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.160]   Or that say you'll have to go to the property?
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.880]   Right.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.480]   That's what Jason Calicones and then Michael
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.640]   Harrington in turn speculated about,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.840]   arguing that the New York Times and News Corp should pull out
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.600]   and make a deal with Bing.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.720]   But the New York Times also owns about.com,
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.080]   which gets 80% of its traffic and 50% of its ad revenue
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.960]   from Google.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.640]   So I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.080]   You know, funny thing you mentioned, Jeff,
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.080]   do you realize that in 1993 Delphi, which was the first internet
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.560]   connection, was sold to Rupert Murdoch?
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.400]   I think he does realize that.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.440]   He was, I guess he couldn't deal with it.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.960]   And he sold it, apparently in 1996,
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   I'm reading the question about dubious source,
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.920]   was down to less than 5,000 by some accounts.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.480]   Wow.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.560]   I had a Delphi account.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.880]   I love Delphi.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.040]   Delphi was great.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.080]   Delphi was one of the big three.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.600]   They were trying to create their own AOL product.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.480]   You like GUI.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.480]   It was a disaster.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:32.880]   I remember.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.680]   And just I was there just at the moment when Netscape was released.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.800]   And I was among those who said, you know,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.480]   I think you might want to try this web thing.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.840]   And then go on for a long time.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.680]   And then I just went.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.120]   Go on the internet.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.880]   So when did you, Jeff, when did you kind of start seeing them?
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.200]   Because you're an old media guy.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.520]   When did you--
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.080]   I'm an old guy, yeah.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.560]   Like me an old guy.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:54.840]   Right.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.000]   Old, old media guy.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.760]   When did you start seeing the light?
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.920]   Were you working at Us Magazine?
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.760]   A people.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.080]   I'm sorry, people.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.120]   That's one inch above in the evolutionary scale of slime.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.840]   Yeah, but you said it very quickly.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.400]   Don't know.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.080]   Not us.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.600]   People.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:18.880]   I got my Osborne 1 and 81.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.680]   And I was on the source and all that stuff.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.040]   And I saw it coming.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.480]   And when I was a TV guy at News Corp,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.520]   I was going to Usenet groups to talk about TV shows.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.480]   Wow.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.080]   Yeah, so--
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.120]   Wow.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.000]   So yeah, you're in your credentials.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.400]   I remember--
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.280]   More than six, but it's been around at least 30 years longer
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:37.680]   than I had.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.640]   Well, he was a--
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.400]   I was in the internet in '45.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.240]   John, you were on the source, I remember.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.400]   I was on CompuServe.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.440]   And I think I used Delphi and Genie.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.880]   I had both the source and CompuServe.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.480]   Because I was at--
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.560]   I was a comfort.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.800]   Yeah, I liked CompuServe.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.000]   The source was the kind of disappointing one.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   1183.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.920]   I think that was my number.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.600]   75106,300.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   You know, so I never had any 8s or 9s in any of those numbers
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.720]   because all the computers were octal machines.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.240]   You're kidding.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:08.720]   It's not so bad.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.400]   I wasn't born yet.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.040]   Oh, no, actually, I created the internet.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.680]   So I got that.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.320]   OK.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.240]   Hey, you're silonning.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.960]   You can unplug and plug in.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.480]   Oh, man.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.040]   Pull out--
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:17.240]   Pull out--
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:17.240]   Pull out--
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.360]   --to the machines to the end.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.320]   Pull out.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:21.840]   Here we go.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.560]   That is just--
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.880]   --the pull out.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.000]   All right, so--
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.600]   And you're now.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.120]   Yeah, but you're coming through your laptop, Mike.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.960]   You have to set the--
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.120]   Sometimes when you would pull out--
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.680]   That's better.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.160]   --there it is.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:30.560]   It's all better.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.040]   OK.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.760]   Sometimes when you pull out, the laptop pulls in.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.360]   So these local BBS systems, and then I found a way
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.640]   to hack into the open internet through the Montgomery
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.200]   County Public Library system.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.840]   So I go in through their card--
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.440]   you could dial into their card catalog.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.080]   And then if you hit the right links,
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.560]   you'd find this open door.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.560]   And it was just like--
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.360]   It's propped.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.840]   And then from there, I could tell and I didn't
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.960]   so wherever I wanted to end up.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.920]   This was in maybe mid '94.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.960]   And I was so proud of myself.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.760]   I felt like such a little--
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.800]   --a little bit of credentials.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.600]   Were you using Gopher?
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.720]   I was using Gopher.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.560]   I remember Gopher.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   Gopher.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.720]   I had this kind of a similar experience.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.440]   I was on the Well, which was--
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.200]   The Well.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.800]   --the Well, Whole Earth Electronic Link.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.440]   And that was started by the Whole Earth folks.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.120]   And the Well, you could drop out of--
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.720]   they had forum software, basically.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.840]   Very primitive.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.160]   It was green text on a black screen.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.960]   But you could drop out of it to a shell, prompt.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.760]   And then you could use links to browse.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.360]   But I remember very well the first time when I got on Link--
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.520]   I was using mostly Gopher, which was a menuing system.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.200]   But the first time I used links--
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.800]   and there were probably not very many sites.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.640]   And this must have been roughly the same time, '92, '91, '93,
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.760]   somewhere around there.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.800]   But I got-- for the first time ever,
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.920]   that experience that, wow, there's a lot of people out there.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.520]   And now, of course, it's commonplace.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.640]   But that first experience of, wow, there's
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.720]   a lot of people using this is pretty transformative, I think.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.560]   What do you remember your first experience?
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.480]   Well, that's a fascinating story.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.920]   Leo, what else do you have to have to have that?
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.400]   We missed a job.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.640]   You know that-- remember, was it trinitra?
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.800]   What was the one trinitra that predated
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.000]   it was called something else?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.600]   Trinitra--
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.040]   Well, Prodigy wasn't it based on the mini-tell stuff
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.200]   that France did?
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.280]   No, but they had another name for it,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.000]   something triton or trinitron or something.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.920]   You know, I think in quantum, quantum, quantum, like--
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.440]   It's just the name of the thing before they changed its name.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.040]   This one, when the first investor-- I don't remember.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.800]   Somebody can look it up and pass it along.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.760]   Somebody will tell you.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.160]   But some of the-- I remember that they were going to do that system.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.040]   And they were going to put ads all over the place.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.400]   And everybody was upset.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.400]   Oh, they were so upset about these ads.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.320]   And now we're doing podcasts with ads.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.120]   Well, thank goodness.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.560]   There's your segue.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.480]   And that, ladies and gentlemen, like to tell you a little bit
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.640]   about our good friends at Citrix, the makers of Go to Meeting.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.200]   Should I do it?
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:00.760]   I should do it.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.720]   Why not?
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.920]   We're here.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.160]   You put us here, John.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.600]   But I do want to talk a little bit about when
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   the National Science Foundation--
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.920]   I think it was '95 when they said, OK,
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.440]   now you can run commercials on the internet.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.760]   Before then, you couldn't.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.560]   So we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.920]   You guys remember telephones?
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.160]   Three hours a gig.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.920]   We only use rocks.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.640]   I love it.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.440]   I want to talk about the folks that go to Meeting.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.880]   I mean, these guys have been around since those early days.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.320]   Citrix is one of the first internet--
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.720]   or remote access companies.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.600]   They kind of invented the product.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.680]   Microsoft licensed it.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.240]   I mean, you probably experienced it in Windows.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.120]   In fact, you can still run Citrix Server.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.320]   They do a whole host of consumer interfaces
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.360]   to this incredible remote access technology,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.320]   including Go to Meeting.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.280]   Now, let me tell you a little bit about Go to Meeting.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.680]   It is the way, if you're going to do online meetings,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.000]   to do it.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.240]   There are other products out there.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.280]   I'm well aware of that.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.640]   But this is the one we use.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.440]   We use it sometimes on the podcasts
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.200]   so that people can show us their screens while they're on Skype.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.360]   We use it for meetings all the time.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.320]   In fact, sometimes people say, oh, I want to use--
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.240]   I won't say any names.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.160]   I want to use XYZ technology and say, sorry,
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.400]   can we use Go to Meeting instead?
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.680]   And I'll start the meeting and say, OK.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.720]   And I'll give them control.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   Say, now show me your PowerPoint, your key note.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.480]   Now show me the slides of the presentation.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.480]   It's for collaborating, for training, for product demos,
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.640]   for sales.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.320]   There isn't anything better.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.360]   It's the best.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   And it's really good.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.920]   It's secure, 128-bit encryption.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.720]   You'll save money.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.840]   It's only $49 a month for as many meetings
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840]   as you want, as long as you want.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.360]   And that includes free voice over internet protocol
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.200]   and free teleconferencing, YWACE time and money
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.000]   going to meetings, flying across the country
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.560]   or driving across town, save money, save stress,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.320]   use Go to Meeting.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.560]   I want you to try it free.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.120]   I love our sponsors because they're really great
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.360]   on giving you a chance to try it.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.320]   They trust that you will--
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.680]   they know you want to see it, and they trust that you will--
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.400]   if something's really good, that you will buy it.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.920]   So try it free for 30 days.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.600]   Go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.560]   G-O-T-O meeting.com.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.200]   Somebody sent me an email saying, I
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.240]   bet there's a lot of people going to meeting.com
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.160]   and myPC.com because it's always go-to.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.040]   Sometimes I say go-to go to meeting.com,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.840]   but that's even more confusing.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:34.400]   So just the website is www.gotom meeting.com/twit.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.200]   Give it a try today.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.120]   I know you're going to love it.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.200]   Go to meeting from the folks at Citrix.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.400]   Thank you for that, Segway.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:39.840]   What was it?
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.200]   It was in '94 and '95.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   Do you remember?
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.240]   The National Science Foundation said, OK,
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.200]   that you can now send commercial traffic over the internet.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.840]   It was that recently, I'm pretty sure.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.160]   Anybody--
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.720]   I had to be by '94 because that's when the first--
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.320]   I think ads went up on Hot Wired.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:58.800]   The very first--
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.960]   So it's probably right then.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.520]   I was-- John and I were doing the radio show when it happened.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.000]   I remember very well when the NSF said, OK,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.640]   we relinquish our non-commercial rules on the internet
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.200]   and we'll allow--
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.720]   Boy, that's--
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.120]   And at the time, I remember thinking,
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.000]   this could be really bad.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.720]   So everybody was against it.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:28.000]   I still remember when businesses decided it was OK to announce
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.040]   that they had a website.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.320]   And so they go add these little tag lines
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.720]   to their commercial with the URL.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   But they would just mess up the whole syntax.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.000]   It'd be HTTP/backslash.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   Yeah, remember?
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.240]   WW.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.240]   It was like, what?
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.160]   Like, you just broke something.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.840]   What are you typing?
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.360]   When we started doing this site, which was the MSNBC show
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:52.440]   we started in '96, they would-- on all of the graphics
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.800]   they put on the screen, they'd have HTTP/slash.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.240]   And I said, you know, you guys, you probably
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.000]   could leave that off.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.800]   No browser requires that.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.920]   You're wasting a lot of space.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.200]   And then I remember at Tech TV a couple of years later
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.640]   saying you could also leave out the WWW.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.520]   Let's simplify this a little bit.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.520]   There was a period of time there where, for some reason,
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.880]   if you didn't set your server right,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.520]   if you didn't put WWW on it, it would die.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.280]   You could still do that.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:19.640]   Most people--
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.200]   I still see people who set them up wrong.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.200]   Most people know better.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.840]   But it's completely possible to set it up
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.160]   that if you don't do that.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.960]   And in fact, every once in a while, I'll find a place like that.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.320]   I'm thinking, what are they thinking?
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.720]   Who are these people?
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.880]   I'm talking about memory lane.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.440]   Remember the Fido net?
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:34.840]   Fido?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.680]   I was a Fido net cis-op.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.400]   Were you baritone?
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.080]   You're BBS?
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.200]   I wasn't a cis-op.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.880]   I had friends who were cis-ops and cis-admins.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.480]   And they gave me privileges.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.440]   But I never operated one myself.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.280]   The guy who wrote Fido net was Tom Jennings.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.520]   Remember him, John?
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.760]   Actually, we gave him a Devorak award one year.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.080]   First time I ever met him, actually.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.240]   He was quite a character.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.600]   He was a real-- I wonder what he's doing.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.360]   I ran a Fido net BBS.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.440]   They got off.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.360]   Yeah, he was a little whack.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.880]   Eagle.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.000]   Well, he's on media.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.120]   Let's see.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.400]   He's gained an age.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:14.920]   He's now--
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.920]   --at the time.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.600]   He's so funny.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.800]   You have it, Leo.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.320]   He's--
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.680]   No, I look exactly the same.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.320]   He's gained an age.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.240]   It says he's now a technician at the University
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.000]   of California, Irvine.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.520]   I ran--
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.560]   Sammy, it looks like he's on the witness stand.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.920]   I think he might be.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.360]   I think he might be.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.600]   He created Fido net-- I ran a Fido net clone called
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:41.880]   MacQ in 1984.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.920]   It was a Macintosh BBS in the early days of the Mac.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.200]   So we got to get ahold of him.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.440]   He works at the University of California, Irvine.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.640]   I wonder if he does any program.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.760]   But that was a very empowering thing.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.880]   This is before the days of the internet.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.000]   I had two modems.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   They were 1,200 baud.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.840]   And it was so hard to get in.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:05.960]   It was--
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.800]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   What was the point?
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.440]   Two lines.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.720]   Two modems, two lines.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.000]   I was very sophisticated.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.920]   Some of the BBSs would have four lines.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.280]   They had it.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.440]   That was really expensive.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.960]   And I remember--
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.440]   Oh, yes, sir.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.400]   You were taking stuff in.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.520]   People were calling you for--
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.160]   I was running the BBS.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.120]   And you only had two.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.480]   I said, guys, I'm-- the guys had racks of these things.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.980]   I know.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.960]   Cheap guy you are.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.240]   John used to write for "Boardwatch Magazine."
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.880]   So he knows a little bit about this.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   I remember that.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.800]   And I had-- I remember when Seagate came out
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   with their 20 megabyte MFM drives, that was a big deal.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.920]   I could have 20 megabytes of storage.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.040]   Not gigabytes.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.840]   I think my walk in a row.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.480]   And by the way, this seems cost a mint.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:48.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.120]   They were really expensive.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.120]   Like 1,000 bucks.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.720]   I think my walk in a row.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.360]   Does that sound right?
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:54.860]   Yep.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   OK.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.080]   1,600.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.480]   Yeah, it was $3,900.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.760]   $9.6K.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.880]   But also the memory.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   Oh, memory.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.680]   What did the original five-inch disk take?
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.960]   The single-sided single density was, I think, 120K.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.920]   128.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.120]   128.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.120]   And then you would-- there was a trick
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.400]   where you would punch a hole in it
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.440]   so you could flip the floppy over.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.000]   Remember that?
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.820]   That's hilarious.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.420]   Well, this is all fogy week here.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.420]   Oh, sorry.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.420]   Sorry.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.420]   Work ahead of it for a moment.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.420]   It worked.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.420]   It worked.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.420]   So the chatroom says--
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.320]   Format and verify.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.300]   Format and verify.
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   That's right.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.420]   Chatroom says 78K, 160K, and 180K.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.580]   But the double-sided were 320.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.660]   The first Mac flopies, the disk gets,
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.260]   those hard disk gets, those are 400K.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.620]   I remember that.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.120]   K.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.340]   That was luxurious.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.340]   Oh, there's tons.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.340]   Although--
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.900]   Do you remember that crazy one that Steve Jobs tried
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.060]   to put on the first lease?
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.060]   So what was that called?
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.060]   The Twiggy.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.060]   The Twiggy, yeah.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.060]   And the problem with that was--
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.220]   It holds all over the place.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.540]   The hole for the data read where the head went
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.820]   was right where you would hold the disk to put it in.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.740]   It was so stupid.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.560]   I don't know how we got off on this tangent.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.060]   Let's get back to the big big--
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.320]   Now, the chatroom says it's this week at Old Farts.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:13.820]   It is.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.460]   Yeah, this is this week in Old Farts.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.060]   Yeah, how'd you get here, Barreton?
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.660]   They went out the hell that happened.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.860]   Because in internet years, I'm pretty old.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.780]   I've been on since '94, which is pretty mosaic.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.340]   I have links credentials.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.540]   I've got FidoNet credit.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.380]   I've got Gofor credit.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.220]   I've got some hacker skills.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.660]   In fact, here's my last old school story, which
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.380]   is used to be able to tell that directly into the mail
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.260]   port on a domain.
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.100]   So I used to use Yale's email system to fake emails.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.620]   Because you could just manually type out the headers
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.140]   that you wanted that email to see.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:49.700]   You know what?
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.020]   And most people didn't know how to expose
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.660]   full headers at that time to verify it.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.740]   Don't tell anybody.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.540]   You could still do that.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.180]   What?
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.100]   Yes.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.060]   They haven't closed that.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.780]   You can tell that to port 25.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.180]   Absolutely.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.220]   And if you know what to type, you can type the whole session.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.060]   Am I right?
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.060]   You guys are cis admins.
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.860]   Absolutely.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.340]   I assume that they had closed that one.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.380]   No, I'll be right back.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.460]   This is the problem with email.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.940]   There's no authentication.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.060]   You can do anything you want.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.580]   You just tell that into port 25.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.220]   And if you know the right things to type.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.820]   Now, you were at Harvard when you were doing this.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.940]   Were you faking Yale emails?
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.340]   No, I was in high school when I--
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.260]   You were in high school.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.500]   I was faking Yale emails.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.500]   Why?
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.980]   They had a cool domain name.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.060]   It was like Minerva, that cis, that jails, all these guys.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.100]   That's right.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.580]   They--
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.580]   No, no, no, no.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.100]   Like--
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.220]   Well, this is kind of fun.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.540]   Oh, but geeks, memes to me.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.500]   Yeah, let me get back on the news.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.060]   Let's go back to the present.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.460]   Let's look at the--
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.220]   All right, so let's talk about the tech.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.940]   This is-- you know, this is actually kind of interesting.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.780]   Jacob Nielsen, who is fantastic,
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.340]   he is at the Nielsen Norman group
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.580]   at a real expert on web usability.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.620]   They have a new book you're going to love this--
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:03.300]   And why doesn't his site look something other than SH asterisk
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.220]   T?
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.660]   I'm always--
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.460]   Everybody, why is it?
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.460]   It's like, what's the story?
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.740]   You're asking why his site doesn't look like it was designed in 1989?
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.140]   Well, now I got to look at the site.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.060]   Oh, you're right.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.260]   It's hideous.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.180]   It's awful.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.740]   Wait a minute, you're absolutely right.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.660]   He's always held up as if some kind of guru of usability.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.740]   I wouldn't use this for 20 seconds.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.380]   I'm sorry, I'd like to vorac.
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.260]   You're sounding like me.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.260]   I like Jacob as a nice guy, but you're right, a science or dull.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.220]   He wrote, like, the book on industrial design,
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.060]   the design of everyday things, which I think is brilliant.
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.220]   But you're kind of right, his site is not so hot.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.540]   Now that I look at it--
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.100]   Anyway, they have a new book, which
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:55.180]   has the catchy title of eye tracking web usability.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.820]   But what they do, which is not so catchy, but very interesting,
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:02.820]   is track eye movements using, I guess--
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.220]   Yeah, they have some cameras that do it.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.820]   This is old, by the way.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.420]   There used to be a website, and I wish I unfortunately lost it.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.980]   But I remember seeing the site about 99 that actually
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.380]   did this to most of the sites.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.540]   They were doing eye-ball tracking.
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.540]   Yeah, it's very cool.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.580]   And they had all this crazy data about it,
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.540]   like why this works and why that works
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.620]   and why this doesn't work and what you know.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.340]   Well, so here's the kind of surprising, maybe counterintuitive,
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.900]   but I think very important result that they got,
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.340]   among other things.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.100]   Participants in the study looked at 52% of the ads,
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.380]   50% of ads that contain only text,
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.180]   52% of ads that had images and text separately,
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.180]   and 51% of sponsored links on search engine ads.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.220]   So in other words, they're tracking the eye movements
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.340]   as they're looking at these ads.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.540]   Ads that got less attention included those that
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:00.260]   imposed text on top of images, 35%.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:06.740]   Ones that included animation, punch the monkey, 29%.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.340]   But the ads that had text only did as well as the ads
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.100]   with images.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.340]   But isn't that really a Google factor where
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.940]   it's an issue not of the design, but of the relevance?
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.700]   Ah, yes.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.420]   So they don't take that into account.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.100]   Right.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.820]   The reason Google ads work is because they have relevance,
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   and it's also tied to the experience you're going under
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:31.540]   right then, as opposed to-- at Google--
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.100]   sells that per click value versus banners
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.100]   sell the old media model of messages and impressions
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.140]   and scarcity.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:39.900]   Here's something that might--
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.420]   I thought of it.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.060]   Here's something that might confirm that.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.740]   Well, I'm going to interrupt, too.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.620]   I think Jarvis is on to something here.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.100]   The fact of the matter is if you're
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:51.340]   in an environment where text is like the primary mode
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.900]   of communications, obviously people
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.500]   are going to be attracted to it as opposed to something
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.820]   like even when punched the monkey was up there,
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.460]   it never looked like the rest of the site.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.100]   It was an obvious ad.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.220]   And it was annoying.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.860]   But if you got into, let's say, a very media-rich site that
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:09.620]   had lots of pictures and photos and little captions
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.420]   to the photos.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.860]   I think you have to study that separately,
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.460]   because if you're looking at, for example,
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.740]   when you see a magazine and you see advertising,
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.660]   that is typically the advertising
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.900]   feels like the magazine does.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.940]   And people who don't have the right kind of publishers
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.580]   will let anybody advertise anything.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.460]   And there's nothing worse than going through a magazine.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.460]   And then you find some ad that looks like a cheap ad that
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.900]   doesn't belong in this magazine.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.940]   It makes the company look like a cheap company,
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.180]   and you wouldn't ever buy their product in a million years.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.860]   So there's a lot of variables here
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.500]   which aren't being discussed.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.260]   And I think that this probably is important as the notion
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.780]   that, yeah, text is great.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.260]   I mean, if you can slip in a paragraph in the middle of a
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.420]   news store saying to go buy a product,
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.260]   it's probably perfect.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.100]   That's the way we do it.
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.020]   Or like the ads we do, which--
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.180]   But it has to be in the same type font.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.020]   Well, the ads we do are kind of indistinguishable from the
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.180]   content, right?
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.780]   We say we're going to do an ad, but it kind of blends in.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.300]   Yes, because you've got to change the problem.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.500]   Because you've got the beautiful sonorous--
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:09.900]   And now with the wood from Bose Wave machines.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.460]   There's one more thing I'd pile on with Jeff and John,
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.540]   which is they're assuming that this is trying to assess
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.980]   sort of click per action or cost per action sort of direct
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.580]   response as rather than branding.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.660]   You can't brand with a text.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.580]   Well, but they're watching the eyeballs.
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.020]   So they're also watching-- you're right.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.780]   It's about click, but they're watching what eyeballs are
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.260]   looking at.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.580]   Well, here's an example.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.980]   And I get this on my Facebook page.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:32.220]   I don't know.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.700]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.020]   When I go to my Facebook page, there's always a busty woman
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:36.820]   on the right hand side.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.820]   Have you noticed that?
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.660]   That's your page.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.860]   You just take that sticker off your monitor.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.580]   It's targeted.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.900]   Leo, it's targeted.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.500]   Hopefully Facebook is--
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.020]   I don't know.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.700]   I get Yale dissertations online.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.580]   Yeah, I bet.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.260]   Chris, do you get busty women on your Facebook page?
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.260]   We have a woman in here.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:51.760]   Huh?
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.260]   Let's see it.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:52.620]   Go ahead.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.580]   Go there.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.420]   All right, I'm going to show you.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.580]   I'll go to my Facebook page.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.140]   You guys don't believe.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.100]   Bottom line.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:01.140]   So-- and by the way, busty and inappropriately.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.900]   So I mean, like not normal.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.860]   Well, again, targeted.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.420]   Me, you mean?
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:07.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.100]   But the interesting result--
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.740]   OK, first I'm going to show you the page.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.100]   I get dusty women.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.460]   Is that the difference?
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.460]   Busted or dusty?
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.620]   I don't know.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.140]   Actually--
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.820]   I got Mark Benioff's book online.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.020]   Boy, do I leave a call.
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.340]   Say, well, the busty woman Mark Benioff,
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.300]   you know, what's the difference?
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.300]   So now what happens after prostate surgery?
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:25.820]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.300]   Oh, yes.
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.180]   No care anymore.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.340]   Stop with the busty woman.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.860]   Jarvis has got nothing.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.100]   Unfortunately, it's not working right now.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:37.580]   I'm getting a tomato can label and being asked to donate.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.420]   To Muir Glen.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.260]   Uh-huh.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.580]   Um, rats.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.100]   But I used to get busty women.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:42.740]   Let me refresh.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.860]   Refresh.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.940]   Connect with more friends.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.060]   To bear with me today, what works-- well,
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.740]   what are the advertising sweet spots for the onion?
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.540]   What works for the onion?
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.220]   Well, I think the types of people that come to our site,
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.940]   they want our age group, which is slightly younger,
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.340]   a little bit more educated and smarter,
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.180]   because you have to be that to get the material.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.500]   So we get a lot of entertainment, new TV shows,
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.020]   movie releases, game title releases, a lot of alcohol,
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.460]   unsurprisingly, so liquor companies and beer companies
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.540]   come through not so much with software.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.260]   We've had Eve Online's been on the site a whole lot lately.
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.700]   That's like a sex thing, right?
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.140]   No, no, no.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.420]   Eve Online is a massive multiplayer video game
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:22.860]   that has to--
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.340]   Leo, where is your mind today?
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.140]   Never mind.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:25.860]   From busty women.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.780]   Sex, it's big busty women.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:27.540]   Never mind.
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.060]   I'll tell you.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.660]   It's not Facebook, Leo.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.340]   It's you.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.740]   No, it's-- you know what?
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:32.380]   Oh, great.
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.740]   Now I'm looking at my Facebook page,
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.620]   and it's an ad for soup.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.620]   I'd rather--
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.500]   I like soup.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.060]   It's not too much to chew.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.100]   It's for you talking tonight.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.860]   Anyway, I used to get busty women.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.380]   I must have crossed some line.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.260]   You have a double check of your cookies.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.780]   We've got to look at your web history, Leo, and see why that is.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.380]   So they tested these ads to get back to that point.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.420]   They tested these ads.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:01.100]   And according to Time Magazine, the guy
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.540]   came across a dating service ad.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.380]   They're watching his eyeballs, his pupils,
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.900]   featuring a bikini-clad woman.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.900]   He looked at the woman's face and chest once,
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.980]   and then it's surrounding text five times.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.740]   So even, in that case, the text was--
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.860]   The one who's one for girlfriend will go for a long time.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.140]   Yeah, but what about if it was a can of soup, would that happen?
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.780]   I mean, maybe he's looking at the woman.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.980]   He's saying, wow, this girl's hot, and he's reading.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.500]   He says, what?
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.900]   She's living near me.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:26.500]   She's here.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.820]   You get those ads too.
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.340]   You would get those ads too.
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:29.940]   You admit it.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.580]   Now you know-- I know you get those ads,
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.820]   because that's what it says.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.820]   This lovely young lady who lives in Oakland, California,
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.820]   would like to meet you.
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.940]   I'm not kidding.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.020]   Look at Campbell's--
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:40.340]   Yeah, I know.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:40.900]   I've seen these.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.580]   These are the ads from that group, the friend finder group.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.380]   And they do this, and they have the same pictures
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.420]   of the same women all over the country.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.420]   It's this woman is not living near--
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.500]   Oh, this is bogus.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.000]   No.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.980]   They should do something about it,
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.060]   so you keep looking at this.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:53.540]   Yeah, this is a bull.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.100]   She doesn't live here.
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:55.620]   I can't--
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.420]   She doesn't live here.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.500]   She doesn't live around here.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.780]   She's a model or something.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:59.940]   Are they stole the photo?
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:00.940]   I have no idea.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.620]   I think that's an onion story.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.740]   Woman who wants sex with you doesn't.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.100]   Doesn't live here.
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.780]   Doesn't live nearby.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.980]   I'll tell you something else creepy about--
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.980]   we do have a lot more ability to track what happens with advertising
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.100]   than we've ever had.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.700]   And one of the segments for the future
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.220]   show that I was working on--
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.860]   we visited this company called Neurofocus up in Berkeley,
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.100]   California, actually.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.340]   And they put electrodes on your head,
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:27.260]   and they track your attention to the 30-second spot
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.900]   or whatever you're looking at, your retention of what you saw,
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:34.220]   and your emotional engagement with what you saw, plus eye tracking.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.700]   So they have millisecond level understanding
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.620]   of just how you respond to that ad,
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.780]   and then we'll tweak it for future reference
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.980]   to have even more effective impact on your brain cell
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.660]   for ideally your role.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.700]   I can imagine them putting sensors in other places, too.
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.260]   Philip K. Dick.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:51.980]   It's all happening.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.740]   Rode about this.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.380]   That had nothing to do with John's comment.
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.100]   It was just a coincidence.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.140]   We let it go, Leo.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.940]   We let it go.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.460]   Rode wrote many a story where ads are on every surface,
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.020]   and they're targeting you.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:10.140]   In fact, Corey Doctorow has a story where the ads know
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.340]   everything about you, and they're on everything.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.380]   They come-- they're moving ads on the packages,
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.660]   and they sense who you are.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.500]   And they show-- I think this is just a matter of time.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:27.300]   Moving along, the Space Shuttle Atlantis launch will be twittered.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.180]   I'm not great to you.
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:33.860]   NASA is sending 100 of its Twitter followers
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.380]   to Cape Canaveral for tomorrow's launch of Atlantis.
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.660]   They awarded tickets to the first 100 people
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:41.740]   to register on the site.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.580]   It's a tweet up at the launch site.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.100]   What are you going to say?
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.020]   It's going.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:47.540]   It's going--
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:48.620]   It's loud.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.740]   Wow.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.260]   It's a big fireball.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.180]   Oh, no, the humanity!
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:55.660]   I think it's--
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.100]   How do they pick the people who get to go?
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.260]   First 100 people sign up.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:58.780]   Scam.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.740]   Now, if they picked a tweeter to go up in the thing,
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:02.420]   that would be new.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.420]   That would be talking--
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.540]   Ooh, I'd do that.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.020]   I'd laugh at you.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.780]   And they should just, in fact, load up the ship
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.220]   with a bunch of them.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:08.660]   Well--
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.140]   Just get them off the planet.
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:10.460]   Well--
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.900]   Just all the Twitters.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.180]   That would be a good idea.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.860]   Get off on my planet, you Twitters.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:26.340]   NASA has used its astronauts to tweet from space in May,
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.780]   Astro, Mike.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.700]   That's so sad that they make the astronauts have handles
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.260]   to begin with Astro.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.100]   They could have put NASA.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.300]   That'd be less corny.
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:39.420]   And now Astro Jeff and Astro Nicole
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:42.260]   are also on the list of tweeting astronauts.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:42.820]   Oh, this is--
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.340]   Astro Boy.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:43.340]   --is a--
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:43.840]   Astro Boy.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.540]   --tweeting astronauts.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.340]   Sounds like a rock band from the '50s.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.260]   It's insane.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.780]   I'm a tweeting astronaut.
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.340]   That's all that dignity is gone.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.340]   Just shot that at all.
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.100]   Dignity.
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.060]   It never was there.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.020]   Never was there.
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.860]   That's sad.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.420]   I'm peeing in my diapers.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.700]   And the dignity left then.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.140]   Right.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:10.980]   So how about the 19-year-old who was arrested
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.780]   and put in Rikers Island for robbing two men in Brooklyn
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.340]   who has been exonerated by Facebook?
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.340]   That's so cool.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.980]   It's cool and disturbing.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.700]   This kid was in jail for 12 days.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.180]   Rikers Island is in home.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.180]   Now, once they verified that he sent this Facebook message
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.300]   from his father's house in Harlem,
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.580]   now he was at his father's house with his whole family
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.780]   and their statements weren't good enough
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:35.500]   to get this kid out of jail.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.700]   But then they went to Facebook and like, oh, well, Facebook
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:38.860]   says you were there.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:39.940]   So we'll let you go.
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.780]   That is absolutely-- yeah, that's a great observation.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:43.620]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.140]   Yeah, it really is, Bartenday.
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.300]   But I think this is your hacker, Bartenday.
