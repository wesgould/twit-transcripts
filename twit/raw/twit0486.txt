[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.800]   tech journalists and my personal friends.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.360]   At least somebody, anybody who's available
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.960]   on a Sunday afternoon, that's basically all we can do.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.040]   - Jason Stell is here, it's always great to have Jason in here.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.080]   Present. - Available.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.280]   - Jason, formerly editorial director at IDG Publications.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.000]   When IDG folded world magazine,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.200]   he went out on his own,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.920]   he has a great blog, six colors.com.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.840]   A whole podcast network, which is, I think,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720]   keystone of that is the incomparable, which I love.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.160]   - Right, you know, podcasting is back, Leo.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   - All right, so I hear.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.480]   (laughs)
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.840]   All of us who've been doing podcasting for years
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.360]   are very grateful that the mainstream media
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.160]   has discovered, oh, we thought those guys were dead.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.080]   They were gone, they were over, it was history.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.680]   No, we're back. - Yep.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.600]   - Actually, we were just listening
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.440]   to a really nice piece on this morning's weekend edition
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.760]   on NPR by John Kalish, that included Twit,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.920]   but also John C. Devorak and a lot of independent podcasts.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.120]   That's the nice thing.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.240]   He briefly mentioned, serially, briefly,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.440]   I don't even know if he mentioned Blum's startup,
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.880]   but then he got into the real meat of podcasting,
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.280]   which is the indies, which I think is the most interesting.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.880]   Anyway, great to have you. - Great to be here.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.040]   Look, who else is here, hasn't been here in ages,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.720]   Becky Worley. - So happy.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.840]   - Oh, I am so happy to see you. - I miss you.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.280]   - Oh, my dear, we try to get Becky on all the time,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.280]   but you are so busy, the ABC with Good Morning America.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.640]   And you do Yahoo's, they're tech page now,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.680]   and we do a lot of pieces. - Yeah, with Grace,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.320]   Needleman and David Poe,
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.880]   and a lot of really holloggers over there.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.400]   - Yeah. - And then, you know,
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.000]   mostly it's just parenting.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.360]   I mean, my kids are six,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.640]   and I would love to spend my weekend with you,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.800]   but they win. - Most of the people
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.320]   that we really want a lot use that excuse.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.880]   Some of them don't even have children,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.080]   they have small dogs,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   - That's right. - St. Perikites,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.440]   but whatever it is, Sunday afternoon
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.720]   seems to be sacred. - Yeah,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.360]   they're knitting sweaters for their Chihuahuas
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.600]   and watching football.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.000]   - That's exactly right. - I know.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.080]   - I think it's really football.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.840]   - It's well, thank you. - So thank you for giving up
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.160]   whatever good thing you could be doing.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.000]   It's great to see you.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.640]   - And right after your birthday, happy birthday.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.840]   - Thank you. - Yeah.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.480]   - Day two. - Day two, how's it going?
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.560]   - Of being 58. - I just stopped.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.000]   - Stop, stop. - Hey, Harry McCracken
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.960]   is also here to see you. - There we are.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.480]   - Formally the technologizer at Time Magazine
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.000]   then on his own blog and now he's at Fast Company.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.280]   - I am, I mean, I think I'll always be the technologizer,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.600]   but my main gig is Fast Company.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.440]   - We'll call you Sir Technologizer.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.480]   - Very well. - Oh, I like that.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.120]   - Great to have you all here to talk about the week's
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.640]   Tech News.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.880]   Ah, where to start?
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.920]   Black Friday was Friday.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.760]   - Yeah. - Did you?
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.120]   - You don't, you don't.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.320]   I bet you for good morning America,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.400]   though you had to do black Friday.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.600]   - I did, I blest, right? - All the ministry media
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.640]   wants that. - Oh yeah, it's the,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.080]   you know, you have to think about it this way.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.160]   It is one of the, it's the woodstock unfortunately
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.600]   of our generation is it's a communal shopping experience
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.680]   from many. - I'm not waiting in line
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.840]   to get the iPhone, is the woodstock?
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.400]   - Yes, yes, yes, that also.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.880]   But it's in the vein, it's, it's a maybe--
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.960]   - I have never done it, have you ever done it?
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.360]   - Well, I've covered it. - Go out to Best Buy
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.000]   at midnight. - Oh yeah, I've covered it
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.680]   for 10 years and there's two types of people who do this.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.280]   One, it is a family experience.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.720]   And the other, it's an opportunity to get more for Christmas
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.280]   because their dollar goes farther.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.560]   And it's really, you know, survivalists,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.080]   people who are, every penny counts.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.400]   And so they think they save three to four to $500
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.160]   if they stand in line for those doorbusters.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.280]   - Are those good deals, are they really, or--
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.440]   - They're lost leaders, you still get lost leaders
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.320]   that you're seeing on Black Friday in store.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   They're fewer and fewer and what I noticed
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.920]   for the first time really in the 10 years
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.560]   that I've been studying Black Friday
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.960]   is that the deals online were as significant
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.600]   as the deals, not necessarily the doorbusters,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.640]   but the doorbusters weren't as extreme
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.120]   and the online doorbusters were much, much better.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.240]   They were, the online shopping this year was huge.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.240]   Best Buy site went down for a period of time Black Friday
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.760]   and they said it was 'cause all the mobile traffic
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.680]   that they got.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.120]   - It seems that Black Friday in real stores
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.200]   has gotten, it turned into Black month, Black week.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.720]   This is a picture of shoppers wrestling over
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.360]   at television on Black Friday.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.760]   There's something a little different about this.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.840]   This is England.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.680]   - Ah!
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.440]   - So now Black Friday is normally based on the day
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.960]   after Thanksgiving, they don't celebrate Thanksgiving
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.960]   in England, but apparently, according to Yahoo News,
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.800]   I think you've heard of them.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.000]   - Yeah, I have.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.160]   - Black Friday violence is stepping up all over the world.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.720]   - I'm so glad we could share that.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.840]   - It's an excellent word.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.920]   So I do one of my podcasts is with an English guy.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.960]   Mike Hurley and he was telling me that we,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.760]   he doesn't understand anything about Thanksgiving
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.400]   and the thing he really understands about it
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.640]   is that the next day they have Black Friday sales
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.120]   and they do that in England now too.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.080]   We have definitely exported the idea that consumerism
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.000]   begins right about now and runs rampant until Christmas.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.760]   - The worst part about, ugly.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.600]   - Yeah, ugly.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.200]   - Have you guys heard about singles day in China?
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.040]   - Yes, that was the one with a guy bought 90 iPhones.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.880]   - Yeah.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.440]   - And that proposed that she said no way.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.280]   - Yeah.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.560]   - It's their version of Black Friday.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.160]   It's a made up holiday for single.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.440]   - It was created by Alibaba, wasn't it?
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.640]   I mean, it was really, I think it was.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.200]   It was created by Chinese retailers a couple of years ago
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.160]   to try to gin up sales.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.320]   - And that was huge this year.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.800]   But to your point about it starting earlier,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.200]   PayPal analyzed their data and they said that the sales
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   started last Wednesday, was the start of the sales
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.480]   and the apex was on Thanksgiving, where the best sales
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.440]   and the most sales were and then it winds down to
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.080]   really through next week, cyber week.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.520]   - Amazon's doing all week.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.600]   They're doing like every hour a new deal.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.360]   Actually, I don't know why you would fight in a store
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.200]   for something.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.760]   I guess do you get better deals in the real world
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.600]   in brick and mortar?
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.720]   - Only the doorbusters this year.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.800]   And so that's really the beginning of the line.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.240]   Or in certain cases, the stores were doing a better job
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.600]   of managing Black Friday this year.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.800]   Some stores had bracelets.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.960]   So while you were in line, you knew, you told them,
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.000]   okay, I'm gonna go for this, I'm gonna go for that.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.480]   And they'd give you a bracelet or a ticket for that item
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.320]   so that it would alleviate some of the sort of the melee
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.360]   in the aisles.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.040]   And then Walmart has a one hour thing where even
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.560]   if they sell out, so long as you're there during the one hour,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.120]   you can get a rain check and come back for it another time.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.080]   - Just kiss me a stomachache.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.760]   I just feel like it seems like horrible,
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.920]   a horrible experience, but people seem to enjoy it.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.000]   - It has become a bizarre tradition.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.560]   I am not saying, and certainly the Thanksgiving thing
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.160]   just really irks me because I just--
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.920]   - Yeah, Walmart has a midnight Thanksgiving day.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.880]   - Even if it opened at five PM, six PM on Thanksgiving day.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.760]   - Yeah. - Most of them five and six PM.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.000]   - Is it bad for the rest of the shopping season
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.240]   if all of the deals are front loaded?
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.480]   Will people not buy stuff from around?
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.320]   - So that's the name Black Friday is,
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.400]   it's a chance for retailers to get in the Black.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.000]   Implying they've been in the Red all year.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.920]   And they're finally gonna make a few bucks on Thursday and Friday.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.600]   But is that the case?
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.000]   - I don't think that the Black and Red
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.200]   necessarily makes a difference here in terms of retail,
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.720]   although we know that the most technology products
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.600]   are sold in Q4, sort of from September till December.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.080]   But what I do think is that it's a cat and mouse game
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.120]   with the consumer and it's always changing
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.240]   and it's always going to change.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.840]   So at one point in time, it was just Friday.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.280]   Then they threw in Cyber Monday.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.520]   Now it's the week before and it's always moving.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.720]   One thing that's different this year
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.400]   is that their category is emerging on different days.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.000]   So phones, Android phones, unlocked phones,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.920]   generally before Thanksgiving and on Thanksgiving
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.160]   and Black Friday.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.600]   Then Black Friday and the weekend is clothing.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.720]   Cyber Monday is shoes.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   I know, crazy, it's now Cyber Shoe Day.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.000]   - Although I gotta tell you tomorrow, Cyber Monday,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.280]   my phone woke up.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.360]   Did I say okay, Google?
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.200]   - I think you did.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.440]   I think you knew that you wanted to go shopping.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.280]   - My phone woke up.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.560]   - You knew that you wanted to spend money
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.560]   and it just woke up, right there.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.480]   - Hoi telephone.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.400]   - Hoi!
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.840]   I should change it to a hoi.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.160]   - That's a good one.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.920]   - So on my podcast with the English guy,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   we used to say, "Hey, Siri" all the time
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.360]   and we were activating everyone's phones
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.200]   because you can't customize it.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.040]   - 'Cause you have just done.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.160]   - Which I have just done.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.920]   And so now what we speak in code,
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.080]   we say a hoi telephone because you don't wanna say
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.520]   the actual any of these trigger phrases
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.240]   you were ruining people's lives when you say it.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.320]   - I have been saying lately, okay, followed by Google.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.160]   - Yes.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.960]   - But, okay, period.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.360]   - I don't think I said it, but for some reason,
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.000]   my phone woke up for no reason at all,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.680]   which means others did as well.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.520]   - Hi Leo, we understand you'd like to spend some money.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.200]   Can you tell us how we can take your money?
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.360]   - Monday, maybe this is why,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.760]   'cause that is a Nexus 6
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.640]   and I was about to say that Monday Moto Maker
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.280]   is gonna offer 150 bucks off Moto Xs,
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.120]   which I think is one of the great phones.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.920]   - That's the unlocked price.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.480]   - Yeah, and if you wanna go with Verizon, it's a penny.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.320]   - Yep.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.720]   - If you've got time to renew.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.640]   - They're given the Galaxy S5 away all week
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.720]   and it's the penny, it's free, it's not--
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.400]   - That's 'cause Samsung can't sell them really.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.240]   - Yeah.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.080]   - Yeah, the Samsung said they only sold only 12 million S5s,
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.520]   but they expected 40% more.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.960]   - Oh, I bet they did that this weekend.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.040]   I mean, the push was massive.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.440]   - Maybe that turned to worse.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.160]   - So there you go, it's good for Samsung.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.440]   Sales online this Black Friday,
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.760]   we're up 20% this year over last year.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.040]   Black, this is, these are from a variety of sources,
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.000]   including Adobe, Channel Advisor and Cacitora
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.760]   between 20.6% to 24% year over year.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.600]   But what's interesting is that
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.520]   somewhere between 27 and 30% of you
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.960]   bought on your mobile phones and tablets.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   Not an on computer.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.160]   - That's 30 to 40% of all online sales were mobile.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.000]   - Wow.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.960]   - So that was a big change.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.280]   And as I said, that's what--
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.920]   - I can imagine shopping on my phone.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.480]   - That seems an even crappier experience
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.080]   than going for a doorbuster Walmart.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.880]   - I was with my mom over the holiday
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.360]   and she was doing tons of shopping on her phone.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.200]   - She was.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.800]   - I was driving around and she was in the passenger seat
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.080]   buying stuff.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.960]   - And why?
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.240]   Did she explain herself?
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.080]   - Well, we were in--
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.920]   - Did we get the deals?
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.640]   - Well, we were in the car, so--
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.480]   - She had nothing else to do.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.880]   - She had a mobile device, she didn't have a lot to do
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.360]   and a mobile device is easy
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.240]   and she's just very comfortable with it.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.720]   - And it was it mostly like Amazon or?
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.160]   - I think it was here and there.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.800]   Every once in a while she would ask me something.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.720]   She asked what the name of Boston's hockey team was
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.600]   that she didn't know off the top of her head.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.880]   - Was that like a password?
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.760]   - Despite having lived in Boston off and on for--
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.640]   - Do we have hockey team?
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.280]   - She was buying something for a Bruins fan
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.360]   but she wasn't sure what the name of the team was.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.640]   - So you told her Calthix, right?
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.480]   - Yeah.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.320]   - No.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   - Okay, so here's my Black Friday question for you Harry,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.040]   is that we saw the first four KTVs,
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.080]   you know, in the 50 inch range for sub thousand bucks,
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.480]   899 on Amazon.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.600]   People were asking me all my people who work at ABC,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.560]   I gotta get a new TV, tell me which one to buy.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.600]   What do you think, 4K, are we, where are we people?
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.840]   - We're sort of approaching the bubble words,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.160]   it's worth considering I'd say.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.320]   I mean, if you buy it today you still won't get
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.120]   very much out of it and it might be a long time
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:57.960]   before you do.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.800]   - It might even be worse than that because the 4K you buy
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.280]   today will not necessarily support 4K standards--
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.120]   - Right, right.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.320]   - Going forward, so it'll continue to work,
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.880]   it's not like these new standards will break it,
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.480]   but you may not get the best picture out of it.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.880]   4K TV that comes out after these standards are established
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.720]   will be better.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.200]   - I mean, I think that, I do think it is actually true
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.840]   that upscaling kind of works in some cases
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.680]   and stuff can look good, stuff which is not 4K,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.360]   can look at it on a 4K TV.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.120]   - But we're getting 4K content otherwise.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.160]   - You aren't, basically.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.520]   - Yeah, you have to buy, Sony gives you a hard drive
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.600]   with your 4K TV.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.440]   - You can get it from the last--
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.800]   - That's not the $800 4K TV though.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.440]   - No, I have a new campaign, I want my TV to be dumber.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.680]   - Hey man.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.400]   - Yeah, why are they putting smarts in these TVs?
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.160]   'Cause the smarts that Samsung and LG and all these guys
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.240]   put in is so dumb.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.080]   - I'll tell you why.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.920]   - It gets in the way.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.480]   - It's because it's the same reason why nobody
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.600]   in the mobile business or the cable business
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.000]   wants to be a dumb pipe, right?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.520]   They wanna add value otherwise they just have to compete
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.680]   on this basic service and their margins go down.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.240]   The TV makers, it's the same way.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.320]   They're terrified if all TVs are exactly the same
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.880]   because all we do is connect these little outside boxes
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.160]   to them but the outside boxes are a way better approach
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.920]   just like using Android Auto or CarPlay
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.720]   would be better in a car because there are companies
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.840]   that really are good at this stuff
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.800]   and then there are the companies that aren't so good.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.640]   - Seems to be. - And the TV makers
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.480]   are not so good.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.280]   - A monitor should be just the monitor
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.720]   and I can apply the smarts in whichever way up
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.120]   for an Apple TV or a Roku or a Blu-ray player,
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.520]   whatever I choose.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.360]   - Right.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.040]   - The problem, you know, we have a very fancy,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.080]   I bought the Samsung curved OLED display last year.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.360]   - Oh really?
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.320]   - Well, I had to, it was research.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.920]   - Well, mm-hmm.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   - And yeah.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.600]   - It was a very expensive TV.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.440]   - That's a lot of research.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.520]   - It's like $9,000.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.520]   - Oh, mm-hmm.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.880]   - And it turns itself off at random intervals.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.280]   You're watching a show and it just decides
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.560]   I don't think he's watching and it turns it off.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.960]   - That eye tracking technology.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.840]   - It, yeah, it's too smart.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.360]   It pops up so I'm watching the World Series.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.680]   I think the Giants were in it this year, right?
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.080]   - Miss Pass Me. - And the Keltex.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.160]   And then I was watching.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.240]   - The Bruins. - And the Bruins.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.760]   And I was watching and then all of a sudden
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.160]   it says Yahoo Sports.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.920]   It takes up a third of the thing.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.240]   - It wasn't like, I didn't do it to you.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.520]   - Would you like to watch?
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.400]   Would you like to get stats from Yahoo Sports?
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   I'm watching the World Series here.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.000]   I don't want to have to find the remote,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.920]   click the X and get rid of that thing.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.120]   It's very frustrating.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.720]   Periodically Samsung, very kindly sends me warnings
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.200]   and notices that pop up over the screen.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.400]   - Oh yeah, I love getting a software update notification
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.240]   while I'm watching a TV show.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.800]   - I think servers are gonna be down at midnight on Thursday.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   I just want to let you know, I'm watching here.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.880]   - Have you noticed that there are now services
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.200]   that have added buttons to the remotes on these things too?
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.480]   And I'd never heard this term before.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.760]   Dave Zats, you know Zats, not funny.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.920]   He's a, he writes about DVRs and stuff.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.640]   I first heard this term today, which is button spam.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.160]   Which is this idea that they suddenly,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.840]   oh great, I've got a Netflix button on my remote.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.080]   And for other services I've never heard from.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.280]   - That's the only power that these,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.760]   that the set makers have is they have the remote that works.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.080]   It's the one remote you can bet works
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.520]   because it's got a clear line of sight to the set.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.800]   - Well don't you use Harmony or one of these fancy,
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.440]   I mean, I've retired mine.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.640]   - Not all of the universal remotes work just perfectly.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.600]   That's a news flash here.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.360]   - I retired my Harmony one because another case,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.320]   these TV companies have decided that there's not an on switch
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.040]   and an off switch, there's one switch that toggles.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.360]   But the remote doesn't know what state the TV's in.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.840]   So in order for the remote to work,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.600]   you have to turn everything off.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.800]   First with all the other remotes, which you have to find.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.640]   Now I have all my remotes, what do I need the one for?
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.560]   You've got to turn everything off or it won't work
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.680]   'cause it'll turn the TV on,
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.280]   but it'll turn the box off and it's like, come on.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.680]   - I will go on a tirade is IO is everything
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.240]   with the connected living room these days.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.520]   It just doesn't work right yet.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.800]   And you know, smart features that I want,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.160]   I want a TV that knows that I'm watching
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.640]   a time shifted sports game
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.920]   and that it makes sure that I don't see any
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.000]   updated sports. - Wouldn't that be nice.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.480]   - That's a smart feature I want.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.520]   And as for why they put smart in there,
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.880]   because 3D didn't sell enough TVs
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.840]   because they didn't have any other new technology
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.440]   to put into it and smart is cheap.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.480]   - Right, or K is not quite real, you gotta do something.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.480]   I would love, I mean, jumping off on that.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.840]   I would love my TV to be smarter about whatever
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.480]   I'm watching and make some adjustments.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.560]   Now, I know people who just turn off all the adjustments,
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.000]   but like I've got a cinema setting and a sports setting
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.840]   because the sports setting makes everything brighter.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.680]   It's better for sports.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.520]   And a game setting that decreases the latency, right?
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.760]   I have to set that manually.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.120]   My smart TV should probably be like,
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.800]   oh, this is a game I can tell.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.840]   I don't know how it can tell.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.680]   It can tell. - It can tell.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.840]   - It's smart, right?
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.040]   Or this is a football game,
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   I'm gonna make everything brighter, but they don't do that.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.280]   - At least give me a button that says,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.000]   you know, lobotomy, I wanna lobotomy.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   (laughing)
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.720]   Give me a button that says, don't be smart.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.720]   - It's a button spam.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.600]   Just don't give me anything, give me a picture.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.720]   And I'll handle the rest myself.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.640]   - You know, I'll be nice.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.080]   - A couple of Chinese companies,
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.400]   I think I sense and TCL,
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.560]   they're working with Roku and Roku is responsible
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.360]   for their smartness, which I think is actually
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.800]   a really smart way to go about it.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.640]   - That's a step, that's a step.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.080]   - Because Roku knows, or Roku,
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.200]   there are lots of things that Roku does not try to do.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.800]   The stuff that Roku does do,
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.520]   it does better than most of the smart TVs out there.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.360]   - And it's--
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.960]   - The TV business is a bad business to be in.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.880]   Sony is, in fact, losing tons of money,
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.120]   Panasonic's, all the Japanese TV manufacturers
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.420]   are losing money on TV.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.840]   And it's these Chinese companies,
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.000]   the Korean companies have started to falter.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.760]   So now it's these Chinese companies like TCL and iSense.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.160]   In fact, iSense took over the Microsoft booth at CES
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.040]   and tried to write it, I mean,
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.720]   they wanna be your next TV.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.520]   - And guess who never jumped into the TV business, Apple?
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.440]   This very reason.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.280]   - Yeah, they were smart.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.000]   - And you know, they knew that it was a lot about
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.520]   just too many conflicting environments
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.040]   and ecosystems at war and you're never gonna win.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.160]   And Harry jumping off your point about Roku,
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.600]   I mean, one of the smartest things they have
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.320]   is that headphones jack on their remote.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.120]   - Isn't that awesome?
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.040]   - If other TV companies did that, wouldn't that be genius?
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:57.880]   I mean--
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.480]   - The Roku 3 has a headphone button,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.080]   the volume control on the Roku turns it up and down.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.120]   You just plug it in, you don't have any headphones.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:04.960]   - Any headphones?
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.800]   - Any headphones.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.640]   - Genius.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.720]   - Love that.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.560]   - We should be consultants,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.920]   all these different companies should be friends.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.760]   - Listen to us.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.600]   - We translate this into Korean
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.320]   because we would definitely make some impact.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.360]   - But I talk a lot on the radio show,
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.480]   you probably do in GMA, you talk to normal people.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.160]   And normal people really don't have the same experience we do
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.040]   and they want all these pictures,
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.280]   just 'cause they think that's gonna be better.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.240]   They want 4K, well, it's gonna be better.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.720]   It's like 64-bit processors,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.280]   it's gotta be twice as good as a 32.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.320]   I want that.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.400]   - Well, they got fooled into it
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.320]   because when they saw their first HDTV,
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.600]   their jaws hit the ground and they think that
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.160]   the next thing, the 3D, the 4K,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.240]   is gonna be a similar-- - I think the 4K
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.480]   would be the same experience if you saw it.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.200]   But you have to have content.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.080]   - Well, okay, so let me go back to the content thing.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.360]   This is what made me think that maybe it's time
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.760]   because one of my photographers,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.560]   he said, I gotta get a new camera and I'm gonna get 4K.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.920]   So even the guys in the field now are saying,
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.320]   you know what, if future proof myself,
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.040]   I need to next upgrade the 4K.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.600]   So that kinda tells me, you know, they're buying into it.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.760]   So I think it's gonna happen.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.720]   - Yeah, look at that Apple 5K display,
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.640]   have you played with that?
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.160]   - Ooh, I look at that every day.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.000]   - You have one.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.600]   - I have one, that's my main system.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   - Yeah.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.040]   - Although it's a laugh when you look at 1080 video content
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.840]   on it 'cause it's like little tiny.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.080]   - Funny?
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.880]   But I think that's an example where Apple
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.840]   has moved consumer expectations forward with retina
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.200]   and now with this.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.880]   People are starting to see higher quality displays.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.040]   Phones have gone crazy.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.680]   Most phones now are QHD.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.600]   They're 2560 by 1440.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.280]   You don't, on a five and a half inch device,
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.880]   do you really need all those dots?
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.640]   Ironically, Apple's being left behind by the high
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.640]   whereas display's another big item on sale for Black Friday.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.280]   Solid state storage prices, this is from Forbes.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.880]   But what's interesting is I don't think this is gonna be
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.840]   Black Friday only.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.280]   I think this is a general trend towards lower prices
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.840]   in SSDs.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.960]   - They're finally kind of cheap.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.800]   - Yeah.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.960]   - Even big ones like a terabyte.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.320]   - Which is great.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.680]   Here's the 840 EVO which is now being replaced
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.600]   Samsung's latest EVO is the 850.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.280]   But 120 gigs for $65.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.360]   Terabyte drive, we're talking 35 cents a gigabyte.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.920]   That is a big drop from the buck a gigabyte more
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.080]   that they were costing.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.120]   - And it's no longer, you don't have to choose
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.640]   between a lot of capacity with a real hard drive
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.320]   or a small amount of really good capacity with solid state.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.760]   You can get a terabyte.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.080]   - I asked Alan Malvin-Tana who's our SSD expert
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.880]   when he was here on Twitter.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.400]   He scared me, he revealed that he was an NSA consultant
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.880]   on that show and I went, what?
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.120]   - They're gonna have to whack him.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:41.960]   - He just stopped talking.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.880]   - I'm supposed to admit that.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.360]   - Ah.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.720]   But he's also an expert on SSDs
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.320]   for writing for PC perspective at PC Per.com.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.240]   He says the 850 is a very good choice
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.680]   if you're looking for an SSD.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.920]   He likes the Sandisk.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.080]   I'm sorry, the Samsung EVO series.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   - I'm completely spoiled now on storage.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.360]   I can't, 'cause I had that MacBook Air for long enough
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.840]   that when I bought this iMac,
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.920]   it was no doubt it was gonna be all SSD.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.680]   I just can't stand the slowness of storage
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.480]   and I know that, or of hard drives,
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.320]   traditional hard drives.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.720]   I didn't know there's a spinning disk in there
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.000]   and it's inevitably gonna fail
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.360]   and I just, I can't do it.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.200]   I just can't do it anymore.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.520]   It's so much faster to use SSDs.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.800]   - And I think if those of us who are worried that SSDs
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.560]   wouldn't last as long as spinning drives now,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.840]   we could put our fears to rest.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.600]   They've been out for a long time now.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.360]   They seem just as reliable a lot more.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.200]   - There are certainly reliability issues
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.440]   with using SSDs too.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.480]   They're different kind of issues from the hard drives,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.920]   but they don't seem to have that fundamental lack
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.160]   of reliability that we know.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.280]   They have an aging problem,
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   but it's not like with a spinning disk where you know
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.320]   it's just gonna die.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.240]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   It's gonna die.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.760]   - Yeah, I would not like keep my only copy
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.920]   of something really important on an SSD, but.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.760]   - Really?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.600]   - No, I wouldn't keep your own.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.000]   - I wouldn't keep your only copy of anything on it.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.480]   - It's like if you shouldn't have an only copy
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.560]   of anything, you should have at least two or three
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.160]   and some of them should not be stirred at your home.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.920]   - We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.880]   We're having fun, great panel.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.680]   This is, I feel like this is my,
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.640]   we're having a little holiday party.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.160]   Some of my favorite people,
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.040]   and you know they took the wine away, but I thank you.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.720]   I don't know if that was a commentary
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.280]   on my performance or what, but they've taken the wine away,
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.480]   but thank you 'cause Becky Worley brought some PR company wine.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.960]   - PR company wine for your birthday,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.800]   and it's fabulous.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.880]   - The best wine, you know, the sweetest wine is PR wine.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.400]   - That's right, PR wine.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.920]   Thank you, Max Borges Agency.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.760]   - Oh, I know them.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.600]   - Yeah.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.440]   - They're real, right?
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.280]   - It's probably not poison.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.120]   - It's probably not poison.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:34.960]   - Yeah.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.800]   - It's good.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   - It's a,
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.360]   a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.200]   - It's a Robles.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.040]   - It's a Robles.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.600]   - Hassel Robles cab, right?
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.440]   - Cabernet.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.440]   - From, from, down, down the coast, the best of Robles.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.280]   - Yes, it is.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.600]   - Yeah, coastline is the--
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.440]   - Coastline.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.040]   - 2012 cab, and yes, we recommend it.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.880]   - Okay, good.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.920]   - What did you want the bottle back
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.720]   so that you could put that on your wall--
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.560]   - No.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.400]   - With all your other PR gifts?
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.760]   - No, I'm not allowed to have glass in the house.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.600]   - Really?
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.240]   - No, it has gone to a very plasticated sort of world
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.080]   with small children.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.920]   - Well, until the way as we child proof,
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.080]   there's no wine bottles.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.440]   Thank you very much, John.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.280]   Our show today brought to you by I,
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.160]   fix it, you guys know about I, fix it,
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.320]   one of the things that probably I fix it
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.960]   is best known for is their tear downs.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.800]   When new hardware comes out,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.520]   they send, for instance, an I fix it,
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.280]   employee to Australia and New Zealand
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.400]   to get the first iPhone.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.920]   And then before you can even buy one,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.480]   they've torn it apart,
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.920]   which is great because then you know what's in it.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.280]   - I was wondering how they did that.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.120]   - Yeah.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.960]   - According to New Zealand,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   they go to New Zealand. - They go to New Zealand.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.440]   Yeah, oh no, these guys are very serious.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.800]   We've had them on the show before
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.840]   talking about tearing down all sorts of stuff.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.200]   And they were, you know, like the Nexus 6,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.280]   they said, if you can get it open,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.880]   high repairability, but getting it open is murdered.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.120]   And there's 21 screws and they cause it tedious.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.840]   Anyway, that's not their business.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.120]   You might think, oh, well, that's what they do.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.920]   No, they, in fact, they tear this stuff down
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.320]   so they can create repair manuals.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.680]   And if you go to ifixit.com,
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.760]   you will see literally tens of thousands of repair manuals.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.640]   These are all free.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.200]   This is not how they make their money.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.360]   They make their money by selling the parts.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.640]   So if you go to ifixit,
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   you can get step-by-step repair guides for everything.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.720]   I mean, washers and dryers, not just phones,
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.320]   anything that you've got in the house,
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.720]   you can fix it with ifixit.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.160]   They also sell the parts you need
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.400]   and they sell the tools you need.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.240]   And I want to tell you,
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.080]   if you're buying a holiday gift
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.520]   with a geek in your life,
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.480]   or if you're a geek in,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.040]   I have to admit, most of my holiday buying is for me.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.720]   - One for you, one for me.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.560]   - Yeah.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.560]   - One for you, one for me.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.400]   - One for me, one for me.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.000]   This is the Pro-Tech Toolkit 70 Tools.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.480]   This is such a great gift,
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.400]   especially with the 54-bit driver kit.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.200]   Even Becky, you could use this,
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.640]   not just to repair your electronics
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.200]   to replace the iPhone screen or fix your Apple TV.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.440]   There's actually, there's a bit in here for everything,
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.160]   Pentelobes, Torx, there's even a triangle bit
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.800]   which fixes McDonald's toys.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.000]   - I need that 'cause I'm still using my screen savers
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.800]   giveaway screwdriver kit.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.000]   Do you remember that? - Yes!
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.880]   - See, I need that.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.760]   - But do you ever, your kids don't eat Happy Meals, do they?
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   - Well, you know, my mom has them right now,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.720]   they might be eating a Happy Meal as we speak.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.560]   - They're eating them right now.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.400]   - You might need these. - You never know.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.240]   - You've got two handles,
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.880]   you've got, these are really nicely made
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.440]   from solid aluminum.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.840]   Then this is the extender handle
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.440]   'cause it's always the case that the screw
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.200]   is just around a corner. - That's cool.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.040]   - The 54-bit driver kit, 54 standard specialty
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.480]   and security bits, the swivel top precision driver,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.080]   the flex extension, the ESD safe precision tweezers.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.320]   They've got tweezers, they've got spudgers,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.760]   they've got everything you could ever need.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.680]   Lightweight compact, the durable tool roll
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.840]   makes it an on the go choice for anybody
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.480]   and the geek in your life is gonna like it
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.320]   whether he's fixing the eyeglasses
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.360]   or she's repairing cabinet doors and sync fixtures.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.280]   Plus it has tweezers and I mean like you said,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.680]   I don't age but I've aged 'cause I need those tweezers.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.280]   Chin hairs, I'm telling you. - Chin hair.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.520]   - Amongst other things. - I think that's not
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.360]   what I fix it, contemplated but--
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.720]   - Hey, it's multi-purpose. - It works, it's multi.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.360]   They don't tell you what you can and can't do now.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.640]   That's 64.95, but I'm gonna tell you how you can save
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.680]   and then let's show you this too, which I really love.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.400]   You should get both together if you're shopping for a get.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.040]   This is a get, a geek, a geek, a get.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.200]   This is the magnetic project mat
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.360]   and this is what we always wanted before.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.480]   This is a magnet, screws go on there and they stay
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.280]   so you can label each quadrant with,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.080]   what are those, that's a case screw,
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.920]   that one's on the left, that one's on the right.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.120]   It comes with a dry erase marker, this is dry erase.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.760]   It is a lovely gift, a stocking stuffer,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.240]   highly recommended and you can get these,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.800]   oh here's the dry erase marker, look at that.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.640]   - Nice.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.040]   - And I can erase or I can dry it.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.960]   You can get these right now at iFixit.com
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   and save when you go to iFixit.com/twit.

[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.320]   iFixit.com/twit, use the offer code twit
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.140]   to take 10 bucks off any purchase over $50 or more.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.480]   Let's see, where should we go here?
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.320]   - Get it boss.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.200]   - What do you like on that?
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.640]   I have a whole lineup of fabulous stories.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.280]   We were talking on Tuesday with Steve Gibson
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.840]   about this semantic discovered, this new virus,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   reg in, we say reg in because it uses the registry
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.640]   to hide itself on a system.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.560]   But what Steve pointed out immediately
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.720]   is this was not written by your everyday hacker.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.480]   This was written by somebody with lots of resources
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.200]   at their command, very sophisticated.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.120]   Semantic says they have seen traces of this since 2008.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.640]   So this is very much like Stuxnet or Flame.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.760]   These are viruses that are created by governments
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.000]   to be used against other governments.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.760]   Semantic said they don't have the dropper.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.400]   That is the very clever little bit of code
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.640]   that gets on the system, whether through a targeted email,
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.680]   USB, key, they're right, it weighs.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.080]   It then downloads encrypted pieces,
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.720]   decrypts them, deletes itself.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.000]   These are root kits, so no one will ever see
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.040]   that this has been installed.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.560]   And this stuff is very, Steve says very impressive,
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.520]   very well written.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.320]   Glenn Greenwald at the Intercept said it is a part
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.040]   of a decade long joint operation from our own NSA
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.440]   and it's British counterpart,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.920]   the Government Communication Headquarters, a GCHQ.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.000]   And that's based on disclosures from Edward Snowden.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.360]   Semantic said in the world of malware threats,
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.960]   only a few rare examples can truly be considered
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.320]   groundbreaking and almost peerless.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.960]   What we have seen in Regen is just such a class of malware.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.280]   You know, there's some credence to what Glenn Greenwald said
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.480]   because of the countries they've found,
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.320]   Regen in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.480]   India, Mexico, Ireland, Belgium and Austria.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.080]   Not one infection's been found in the US or England.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.440]   - Hmm.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.200]   - So that might be one little clue
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.520]   that where it came from.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.600]   What's interesting is it goes in,
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.280]   in fact, if you look at, I should load the Semantic PDF
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.400]   'cause they have lots of graphs and information.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.640]   But if you load the PDF, you'll see a pie chart
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.640]   of the industries that it infects and it's telecom,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.360]   it's airline reservations, it's hotel reservations.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.520]   It's exactly the kind of thing Saul would use
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.360]   to spearfish a company and get information about people.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.320]   What do you, how do you guys, what do you feel?
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:05.160]   Let's assume the US and perhaps Britain wrote this
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.840]   and has applied it in cyber warfare.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.440]   It seems to me that's better than shooting people.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.320]   - Well, can I ask this question in reverse?
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.960]   So let's look at Stuxnet.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.120]   Is here's something that's exploiting SCADA systems
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.620]   which were generally unsecured,
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.960]   going after nuclear environments.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.200]   How do you feel about that now
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   that we know everything about what they were doing?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.960]   As opposed to presupposing that we don't know
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.280]   why they would do this, let's reverse engineer it
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.840]   and say, okay, here's a case where we do know
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.880]   what they were doing, how do you feel about that?
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.120]   Bravo, they shut down the Iran nuclear enrichment facility
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.160]   by overspinning the centrifuges and not a shot was fired,
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   no one was killed, but I think a serious threat was avoided.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.080]   The argument on the other side as well,
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.520]   but if we start doing it to them,
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.160]   it'll escalate, they'll start doing it to us.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.080]   - Oh, they already are.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.920]   - Yeah, they would do it no matter what.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.440]   - It's not like any permission.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.800]   - Absolutely.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.640]   - So it's okay to do this.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.160]   - If you, do we have a choice?
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.560]   - Yeah, it's hard to put a value judgment
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.400]   on when it's more like this is one of the,
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.680]   I mean, and it's not a hot war, this is spy stuff, right?
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.600]   This is spy stuff.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.160]   Spy stuff like this has been going on
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.240]   and what I don't like about it is that you end up
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.920]   with a lot of independent people's computers getting
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.600]   compromised when they're kind of collateral damage
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.280]   for a larger story that's happening here.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.280]   But this is a front in an information battle,
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.560]   in a Cold War, it's a spy novel writ large on our hard drives.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.480]   - And you make a good point is that the source code
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.560]   goes into the wild and then it's amended
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   by someone who's less sophisticated and more nefarious,
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   then you have the power of intergovernmental spy agencies
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.280]   working against individuals and that seems like it's a problem.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.280]   - That would be bad.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.640]   And that is what happened with Stuxnet.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.880]   It did leak into the wild.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.120]   It looks as if great pains have been taken
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.520]   with Regin to avoid that.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.640]   So for instance, the modules are encrypted
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.840]   and can only be, so you can't examine the source code.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   The dropper, which is,
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.440]   Symantec put a nice little Trojan horse icon next to it
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.560]   so you understand that it's essentially a Trojan horse
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.880]   that sneaks under your system via email or whatever
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   and deletes itself as soon as its job is done.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.960]   It loads in and he crypts the next stage
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.800]   and the next stage and the next stage.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.520]   And it, you know, it's very hard to get any of these pieces.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.120]   In fact, Symantec says we don't have a copy of the dropper.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.560]   We can't find one.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.880]   So that means the bad guys probably
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.080]   are having a hard time too.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.400]   It's also highly targeted.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.680]   It's a spearfishing attack.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.480]   So it's not just spread out in the wild.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.880]   - And basically the stuff is not any more moral
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.200]   or immoral than any other form of spy inherent like.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.440]   - Right.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.160]   - And then the NSAID is stuff in all fronts,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.640]   cyber and non-cyber that we'd be very uncomfortable with
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.200]   and we've learned about a lot of stuff
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.000]   we're uncomfortable with.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.920]   It hasn't been used against anybody in the US so far.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.960]   What if though they attacked US airlines
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.960]   or US rental car facilities, US hospitality industry?
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.840]   Would we then have problems?
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.000]   - Well, I mean, there's the larger issue of spy,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.240]   you know, your spy agencies, your intelligence agencies
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.960]   are meant to be spying on other countries,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.160]   not on your own people.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.400]   And that's a, I think that's a different issue.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.920]   That's like if James Bond was sent to assassinate
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.400]   a member of parliament not to make this too ridiculous,
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.680]   but you know, spying is supposed to be on the outside,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.520]   not on the inside.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.040]   And most of the controversy about the NSA
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.000]   spying on American citizens or people living
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.160]   in the United States, that's what it's controversial.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.800]   Not that spying happens.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.480]   - I gotta tell you though, that particularly US centric
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.320]   point of view is not welcomed by a lot of the people
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.000]   around the world who say, yeah, it's fine
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.600]   and invade privacy as long as you're not a US resident.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.480]   - Well, I mean, there's a, it's just a different argument.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.160]   And then there are the allies who are being spied on, right?
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.120]   I mean, Angela Merkel is not happy
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.920]   that we're tapping her phone calls,
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.080]   'cause she's an ally.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.880]   I think I imagine the Chinese government
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.000]   and the Russian government probably expect that that
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.840]   is attempted on them and they're probably not surprised
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.680]   when that happens.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.720]   But it's a, these are all different issues.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.440]   But I think the reality is we live in a world
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.400]   where all of these devices are connected on the internet
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.920]   and many of them have huge security flaws.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.840]   And of course they're going to be exploited by spies
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.600]   and criminals and that's the world we live in.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.120]   That's the 21st century.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.560]   - There is collateral damage.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.240]   And I think maybe with this next story
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.080]   is some of that collateral damage.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.880]   One of the things that happens is that
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.000]   around the world US industry gets penalized
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.480]   or is less welcome.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.100]   And the European Union has voted,
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.400]   a European Parliament has voted to break up Google.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.240]   - Yes.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.040]   - And I-
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.880]   - Finally.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.040]   - I have a feeling that some of this of course
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.880]   is the way they treat privacy in Europe
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.400]   where they have a right to be forgotten
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.880]   and all sorts of things that break the internet fundamentally.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.080]   - Pretty Euro stuff.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.960]   - But I have to think that some of it also comes
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.840]   from the knowledge that the US is doing some of the spying
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.680]   and maybe isn't-
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.520]   - Not to be trusted.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.360]   - Not to be trusted.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.480]   - Well, I mean, I think there's a separation here
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.440]   between government and industry.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   Google definitely feels omnipresent, if not omnipotent.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.120]   - You can't search the internet if you just say,
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.720]   well, but only in the US.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.800]   - Okay, well, let's break this down.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.480]   So here's my question to you guys.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.000]   So Google provides a service which is search,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.520]   but their business is ads.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.240]   If you think about it, search is just their marketing.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   So why are those two things in conflict
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.720]   as anti-competitive, as being monopolistic?
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.200]   This is just, I'm playing devil's advocate.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.600]   Explain that to me.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.120]   - Well, I think part of the,
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.040]   that's exactly what this legislator is saying,
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.680]   is that Google is in some of the businesses
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.960]   that it searches over for.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.400]   And I've always kind of been bothered
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.800]   by the fact that Google is a content company with YouTube.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.680]   And there's always the threat, I don't think it happens,
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.400]   but there's always this threat that Google's search engine
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.040]   would favor its own content over my content, for instance.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.200]   I don't think that happens or do you.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.440]   - Well, they certainly weave YouTube into
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.720]   resolving a lot of YouTubers.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.720]   - The way they don't do it with some other,
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.800]   you think it's a certain-- - But they would make the argument
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.320]   that's 'cause YouTube is very popular.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.160]   - Which is true.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.240]   - If you could keep the search engine completely agnostic.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.480]   And Google has also bought ITA,
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.680]   which does airline scheduling.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.080]   And you're gonna see now when you do Google searches
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.880]   for flights, flight information, right?
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.160]   - So if you were breaking this up,
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.960]   you would say there's search and ads which can live together.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.600]   And then every other Google property
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.960]   should be a separate entity.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.440]   - I don't put down-- - Leo, get the Leo.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.280]   It's all about you.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.480]   - This is the European moment.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.640]   - You are controlling, you're not libertarian.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.440]   In fact, the United States government did say,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.080]   we think this is a terrible idea.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.280]   But you know, when you said it, you were right
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.640]   in the sense that Google is in a lot of businesses
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   that are crossing to the content side
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.480]   and that their search engine could in fact
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.000]   any competitively support those businesses.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.400]   Now, when we've mentioned that in the past,
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.960]   our chatroom is quick and quick to say, but that's business.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.560]   - Yeah, the always, the warning sign,
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.720]   and this is what Microsoft ran into in the 90s,
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.080]   is if you're using your monopoly power in one area
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.040]   to extend power over other areas,
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.240]   that when you're putting other people out of business
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.400]   because of your power in your monopoly area,
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.240]   you're extending out of business.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.080]   - What if Google puts without a business
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.760]   because every time you search for a view
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.520]   of an electronics product, it showed its own stuff?
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.760]   - Well, that would be the trick.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.600]   - That'd be bad.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.120]   - If they were promoting their own stuff
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.440]   and using their monopoly power to make you not exist
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.680]   because you're one of their competitors.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.920]   - Don't we have enough data to say they're not?
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.720]   - You know, it's always been debated whether Google--
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.360]   - Do we have data on how Google works?
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.120]   - I don't think they're like talking about that.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.400]   - Google says we don't favor our own content.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.360]   And in fact, you'll see Vimeo results.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.480]   The problem is YouTube is much more popular than Vimeo.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.880]   So you're gonna see more YouTube results
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.320]   when you search for a video.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.120]   - But I mean, Google also spent a lot of time
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.480]   weaving Google+ in Doot.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.760]   All of its services when Google+ was brand new
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.840]   and they didn't have the argument
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.240]   that this is already much more popular than the competition.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.040]   - So is the European Parliament right?
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.280]   Should Google be broken up?
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.840]   I actually might vote for that.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.520]   - Well, how'd that work out with Microsoft?
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.360]   - It didn't.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.200]   (laughs)
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.400]   But the good news is Microsoft in effect did the same thing
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.080]   by destroying its own monopoly.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.720]   - Right, but that was just market force.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.560]   - Yeah.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.400]   - And the cloud.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.040]   - And I think the same could be said for Google+, right?
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.800]   Market forces showed that that didn't really pan out so great.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.280]   - The cool thing about search engines,
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.840]   unlike operating systems, is any consumer at any time
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.560]   can switch with very little effort.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.960]   Unfortunately, I wish we did have three or four other search engines
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.800]   that were as good as Google and a fraction as successful.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.040]   All we have is Ben and Yahoo, which is a front for Ben.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.960]   And the only reason we have Bing is because Microsoft
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.600]   can afford to lose lots of money.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.040]   - And they have hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.880]   - I mean, that is what worries me.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.680]   The thing that worries me about Google's dominance is that
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.040]   while Bing is okay, we don't have a thriving competition.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.760]   We have DuckDuckGo, which is actually quite good
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.960]   and run by a few people.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.680]   - But isn't it really riding on Google's back?
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.080]   I mean, isn't it Google's results that they're delivering?
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.440]   They don't have their own search engine.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.640]   - No, actually they do.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.480]   - They do.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.600]   - But I don't, but is it mature?
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.400]   Is it actually working?
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   For a long time DuckDuckGo was just repackaging
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.320]   other search results.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.600]   - They've done a lot more and they're surprisingly good
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.400]   for a tiny, tiny, tiny company.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.200]   - Good, let's promote DuckDuckGo.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.240]   - But it's not like AT&T and Verizon.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.000]   We're both AT&T and Verizon are far better than they would be
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.920]   if the other guy didn't exist.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.080]   And it would not stun me if one day Microsoft comes
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.960]   to the conclusion that it is just not worth investing
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.680]   as much as Bing as they do.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.240]   And if, when that day happens,
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.480]   I do get really worried about Google's dominance.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.000]   - Well, Google has 95% market share in Europe
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.680]   and only about 70 in the US.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.880]   So you can see why this is particularly European
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   probably as well.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.960]   - By the way, they're a little blow against Google
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.360]   and for Bing, Firefox has just,
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.160]   which had a deal with Google to be the primary search engine
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.120]   in the Firefox browser for many years.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.960]   In fact, made hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.480]   on that deal, we think.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.600]   In fact, it was probably the deal that kept Firefox
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.960]   and the Mozilla organization alive
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.760]   has made a five year deal with Yahoo,
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.440]   which is really weird because as you point out,
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.440]   Yahoo's just re-wrapped Bing.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.880]   So I don't understand that at all.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.840]   But the Firefox browser will now by default use Bing
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.680]   all the, or Yahoo, I'm sorry, Yahoo Bing,
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.040]   but you could reset it if you wished.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.960]   And there is word that Apple probably will do
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.320]   something similar next year.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   - I mean, not to, first of all,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.760]   I have to disclose I work for Yahoo,
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.160]   but if you talk about a conflict in terms of search
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.560]   and content,
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.920]   - Yahoo's even worse.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.040]   - You've got content issues way bigger than Google
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.640]   in terms of their overall business model.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.920]   Google's not making the lion's share of their--
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   - But if I search Yahoo.com for Leo Laport,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.160]   am I getting results from Bing?
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.280]   Aren't I?
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.000]   - So, when I look on Bing and see if it's saying--
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.920]   - I think it's powering behind the scenes.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.680]   - Does it brand Bing?
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.520]   - But although that's--
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.760]   - Yeah, powered, so there it is.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.720]   - They're not in the monopoly position.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.840]   - They're powered right there.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.360]   It says at the bottom, powered by Bing.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.600]   So these results are not,
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.360]   Yahoo doesn't have a search engine anymore.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.840]   These results are now,
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.400]   although Yahoo does have some ad--
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.240]   - I think they can change,
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.360]   and I think they can change the waiting and things on it,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.720]   but they're using Bing's search engine
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.240]   and then waiting it and tweaking it.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.080]   - There are things they can do,
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:40.920]   there are things they can't do.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.960]   And I think they can't really just mess around
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.400]   with the order too much.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.000]   And I think part of why Yahoo did the deal with Mozilla
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.280]   is if Nurse Amyer had been CEO of Yahoo,
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.760]   when the deal with Bing had happened,
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.880]   that deal wouldn't have happened,
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.000]   because it really,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.800]   it was Yahoo kind of giving away something really important.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.520]   And I think today's Yahoo was much more interested
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.560]   in search as being important than the Yahoo
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   that did that deal was a few years ago.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.520]   - Yeah, who's gonna make it?
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.760]   (laughs)
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.160]   - You know-- - You just sometimes wonder that.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.320]   - Nurse Amyer, the quarterly results
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.800]   were kind of flat, right?
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.680]   But it did look like Yahoo might be a little bit
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.840]   turning the corner, especially on mobile, right?
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.000]   That was about a month ago, that those were announced.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.080]   Are you worried for your job?
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.280]   - No, no, I'm just curious what the--
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.840]   - How could Yahoo not make it?
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.680]   - The tech minds of the world are--
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.520]   - How could Yahoo not make it?
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.440]   I mean, what does making it mean?
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.880]   Will they survive as a company?
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.560]   Or will they become another Google?
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.440]   - I think a bunch of people talking about tech
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.960]   on a podcast is both the wrong people
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.000]   and the wrong audience.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.840]   - Yeah, we don't use Yahoo.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.680]   - Just whether Yahoo make it or not.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.080]   I keep likening, like remember when David Poe got up
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.840]   at CES and announced Yahoo Tech
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.480]   and all of the tech bloggers made just like snide comments
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.600]   about how ridiculous the whole thing was?
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.920]   Well, those guys are speaking to the super techy audience
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.240]   that we're speaking to.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.760]   And Yahoo, and I don't mean this as an insult,
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.040]   Yahoo is more like a newspaper.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.560]   Yahoo is reaching a really different audience.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.960]   These aren't people who are super into tech
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.200]   or super into other specific topics.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.720]   There, it's an older audience,
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.600]   it's a less technically savvy audience,
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.440]   and there is a lot of traffic that still goes to Yahoo.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.880]   But it's not the people that we're used to talking to,
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.040]   so it's really easy for us to put them down.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.400]   When, if you start thinking of it as something like
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.800]   a newspaper where there's just general interest,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.720]   there's a lot of traffic,
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.960]   they're not interested in anything in particular,
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.800]   Yahoo has that power, so we might not get excited about it,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.320]   but it doesn't mean that there isn't a place for it
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.320]   in the internet somewhere.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.800]   - I wonder if it was like this at times,
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.040]   working at Yahoo is like standing next to a lighthouse,
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.360]   it's dark for most of the time,
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.960]   and then when the light shines on you, it's blinding.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.360]   It's like, come on. - It's a big company.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.200]   - There's a huge amount.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.800]   I mean, I'm talking to people who work at Yahoo Tech,
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.880]   that's what I hear, is like,
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.480]   you get featured on the Yahoo homepage,
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.400]   that fire hose comes at you,
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.680]   and it is just a massive amount of traffic.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.640]   But that's a little bit like to use my newspaper analogy,
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.560]   I mean, it's like writing about tech
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.680]   in the business section of the newspaper.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.280]   People aren't buying the newspaper for the tech column,
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.360]   but it's in there, and they might read it,
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.280]   but it's just, it's not, it's part of a much bigger package.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.960]   - And they've gone with the magazine format,
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.000]   which is speaking to a different crew
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.040]   and a different audience.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.880]   - It's not for people to read the Verge, right?
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.720]   It's not the same audience.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.520]   - Actually, it's looking more and more like the Verge,
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.000]   and there's a lot of Verge content now on that.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.080]   - Well, they've got, they also got all the content deals,
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.880]   but that again feels like a newspaper thing,
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.600]   it's a syndication thing, where they've got content deals
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.440]   with almost everybody.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.600]   - I think my biggest problem with this format is
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.720]   it's hard to tell the ads from the content.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.560]   - Oh, they're succeeding.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.520]   - Some people consider that a feature, Leo.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.240]   - Yeah, I mean, the ads look exactly,
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.720]   this is a Princess Cruise Line ad
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.160]   next to Four Ways to Take Better Care of Your Laptop Battery.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.880]   - Well, it's-- - It does say sponsored,
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.920]   but that tile looks pretty much the same,
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.200]   and as you scan through this,
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.120]   unless you look carefully to see which is sponsored,
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.360]   which isn't, you're gonna see quite a bit
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.760]   of Dollar Shave Club sponsor stuff, you know?
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.880]   And I think that's, of course, that's what they're trying to do.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.720]   - You know, it's funny because, you know, Becky,
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.160]   for years at Tech TV, I fought the fight
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.160]   for high geek content, and I always felt like,
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.560]   and maybe, and I guess my question is,
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.240]   have times changed, maybe in those days,
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.440]   I really felt like you made a mistake by saying,
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.280]   I'm gonna do, and everybody did it,
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   tech content for non-geeks, nobody cares
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.400]   if they're not a geek.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.600]   The people who care the most about tech content
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.360]   are enthusiasts, so make your content aimed
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.080]   at the people who care the most about your content.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.520]   Enthusiast, it's like, at the time I would say,
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:43.840]   it's like ESPN doing a show about football
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.480]   for people who don't like football.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.040]   So here's the rules, you have to make 10 yards every,
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.760]   and nobody would watch that,
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.160]   'cause the enthusiast would go, that's stupid.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.320]   And if you're not an enthusiast,
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.160]   you're not gonna watch the-- - I don't watch
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.680]   the show every week. - Are you broadcasting,
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.880]   or are you narrowcasting?
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.280]   And that's where you made your call,
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.600]   and made the business out of it.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.080]   - Yeah, and I've done very well as a result,
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.120]   tech TV went away because tech TV decided to be broader,
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.880]   but maybe times have changed,
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.600]   and I think that's what David Pogue is arguing,
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.920]   that everybody uses technology now,
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.680]   and everybody wants to know about technology,
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.560]   so there is a market for content
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.320]   about technology that is not aimed at enthusiasts.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.640]   - Enthusiast, what is it?
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.760]   They used to consume, 10% of the population
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.160]   used to consume 80% of the content around technology,
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.800]   that used to be the metric,
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.600]   and now it's changed,
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.480]   but in a different way than we expected.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.680]   Instead of everybody wanting to go to the verge,
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   the-- - You've looked at the verge now.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.160]   - The vertical of technology
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.840]   is basically consumer reporting.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.680]   - Right.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.760]   - So, I mean, there's no distinction.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.600]   - That's what you do.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.280]   - That's-- - For our mainstream audience.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.400]   - I'll cover phones, and makeup,
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.120]   and parenting, and food, and it's all the same.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.240]   - It's not that there aren't people
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   who are enthusiastic about subjects,
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.480]   it's that I think right now, the internet
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.960]   doesn't have a lot of places
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.600]   for people who are not super into that topic,
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.800]   who are like mildly interested in technology,
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.280]   but aren't gonna read a website about technology every day.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.360]   What do they do?
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.760]   And I feel like sometimes that's what Yahoo's trying to do.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.080]   I don't know whether it'll succeed at it,
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.920]   but I do think that's a missing piece of the web right now.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.360]   - On the radio show, which is the most universal thing I do,
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.200]   and probably the largest audience,
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.760]   I never attempt to dumb it down.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.320]   And if somebody calls up and says,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.360]   my router is, I'm pinging my router,
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.960]   but I'm not seeing the pings back,
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.040]   and I'm wondering if I have a DNS problem,
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.920]   I will answer that question.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.440]   Whereas, and I just feel like that's the right way to go.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.800]   Now maybe, and I could very well be a dinosaur in this.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:40.720]   The Verge, look at the Verge.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.480]   The Verge barely even wants to talk about tech anymore.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.800]   (laughing)
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.960]   - I don't know about that.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.120]   - The Verge, even--
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.440]   - There's a lot of reviews of Android phones
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.440]   on the Verge, and it's a pretty beautiful--
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.280]   - Yeah, but when I talk to me like--
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.600]   - I know, that is what they want to do.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.440]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.760]   - He says he wants to do content
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.960]   that geeks would be interested in,
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.480]   but that's not specifically geeky content.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.440]   - That sounds so vaguely familiar.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.280]   (laughing)
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.040]   - Yeah, I feel like that's a death knell, but I don't know.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.040]   - I've read, I recently dumped my Comcast modem,
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.320]   and went out and bought one and installed it myself,
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.000]   and I did that after reading a story on Yahoo Tech.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.800]   So I do, the thing I like about Yahoo's tech coverage is,
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.080]   it's an attempt to do stuff for a general audience,
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.160]   but to do it well.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.000]   - That's true.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   - There's quite a bit of general--
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.840]   - No corners are--
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.280]   - General audience tech content out there,
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.320]   that's really not so great.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.160]   - Right.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.000]   - I think Ray wrote that article,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.640]   and it was about like, just an everyday,
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.800]   common experience that someone who's interested
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.520]   and not necessarily an enthusiast, but like,
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.360]   I'll take it on. - It's smart.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.600]   - I'm gonna do that. - Yeah.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.040]   - And it's not, I mean, it's actually a little bit
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.360]   of a challenge to do it, so it's not done down,
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.240]   it's kind of assuming that the reader
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.040]   is gonna devote some time to this.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.560]   - That may be the future, actually.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.400]   - Yeah.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   - And it's hard-- - And you've got you, Harry,
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.440]   I mean, you're the biggest geek I know.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.560]   - Talking up, I mean, in the long run, talking up
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.760]   always does better for you than dumming it down
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   and talking down.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.840]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.640]   - Ten terrible tech annoyances that should be illegal.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.080]   Number one, Microsoft pre-roll ads in your video.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:13.200]   I'm sorry, I don't think that was the intent,
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.040]   but that's definitely one of the annoyances.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.120]   Captures should be banned, I agree.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.600]   It's a rape needleman. - Yeah.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.960]   - Captures do nothing, they don't slow anybody down.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.840]   - They don't? - They only slow real people down.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.680]   - They say, yeah.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.480]   - They probably slow the bad guys down.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.640]   - If you're over 40 and your eyes have done that thing
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.160]   where they fall apart at 41 and a half,
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.720]   you can't do a capture. - Word is this.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.680]   (laughing)
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.760]   - Off the torch.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.200]   - I tried to put a Microsoft license code in the other day
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.160]   and I had to do it like 10 times,
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.560]   I'd take my glasses off and hold it right up to my face
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.520]   and control class. - Control class,
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.600]   capture, it's like this is made so that no one can read it.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.680]   - You know, really, Eric's musiant is porn sites
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.680]   are starting to use it and I'm going blind.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.520]   (laughing)
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.880]   - From what? - Doubly, so.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.720]   - Why?
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.160]   See, you see where this happened?
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.720]   - You see, they clearly don't know their audience.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.080]   - Your mother was right.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.400]   - I captured the blind. - Get on the blind.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.240]   - And the point being, and Steve Gibson's
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.640]   pointed this out many times, bad guys actually set up
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.160]   bogus sites with captures, often porn sites
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.760]   and they take the capture from the real site,
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.200]   they put it on the bogus site and so many people
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.240]   are signing up, they're just solving the captures.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.040]   - That's genius.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.360]   That is so smart.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.280]   - Bad guys are smart.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.080]   - They are so smart. - The problem is real users aren't.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.120]   (laughing)
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.360]   - And so the capture foils, with all of this stuff,
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.680]   foils normal people, more than--
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.840]   - The show's gone off the rails.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.240]   - I think it's a good time to take a break.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.480]   We're gonna do that and actually this would be a good time
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.960]   to see what you missed if you didn't watch every second
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.720]   of what happened this week on Twit, take a look.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.480]   - Previously on Twit.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.640]   - And as you know, it's bad to look with
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.480]   and to feel good to feel good to feel good to feel good.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.160]   - Do you ever just look at us and think what's happened?
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.400]   - Tech news tonight.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.480]   - The last week Mozilla ditched Google for Yahoo.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.680]   - Now sources till the information,
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.240]   the Yahoo and Microsoft are separately pitching Apple
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.200]   with a Safari business.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.320]   - Security now.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.960]   - We have an entirely different class of malware.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.280]   Gives me as a developer goosebumps.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   It is clearly the work of somebody with extensive resources.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:14.000]   This is explicitly targeted.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.120]   - Triangulation.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.800]   - We're talking about super smart things, super intelligence.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.360]   - I think there is no necessary connection
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.120]   between how intelligent are and what goals you have.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.960]   - The conceivable that you can have a super intelligence
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.960]   all the goal in life is to make paper clips.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.080]   A world where there are as many paper clips as possible
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.880]   is a world where there are no human bodies.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.120]   - That's kind of where we lose out
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.080]   'cause we're a resource that's just getting
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.440]   in the light of the paper clips.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.360]   - Twit, it's what's for dinner.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.040]   - I'm stuffing you into another leader.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.360]   - Actually that was a very interesting interview
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.200]   on Triangulation on Money with Nick Bostrom,
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:46.560]   who was fairly dry but he is one of the foremost researchers
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.600]   on these new smart machines and the idea that machines
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   may at some point, super intelligence may at some point
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.960]   emerge and he points, yes you heard, he pointed out,
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.480]   just because they're super smart doesn't mean
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.160]   they share our values, they may just really
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.880]   want to make a lot of paper clips
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.320]   and that would be the end of us.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.960]   So now's the time to plan for the future.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.200]   If you didn't see it at Good Interview
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.360]   and a great book, Super Intelligence,
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.400]   we got a brand new sponsor.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.880]   I want to welcome speaking of super intelligence.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.680]   I want to welcome Oscar to our show.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.080]   If you live in New York or New Jersey
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.760]   and need health insurance, this is a new company for you.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.240]   Now I apologize in advance if you live somewhere else.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.640]   This is for New York and New Jersey.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:26.640]   Oscar has a different approach from other health insurers.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.960]   Oscar focuses on everyday people as their customer
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.520]   instead of big corporations.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.000]   You can check it out at highosker.com/twit.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.200]   Very technology focused.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.800]   They're making health insurance simpler,
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.000]   more intuitive, more human at their heart.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.880]   Oscar is really a strong IT department with engineers
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.640]   who came from Tumblr, from Spotify, from Google.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.520]   They think, and I think, I want Oscar to succeed
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.760]   'cause I want it to go and come everywhere.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:54.880]   They think that if they have a customer focused app,
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.560]   that this will help people do a better job
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.400]   of health insurance.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   They developed a personal timeline
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.800]   so you could track your medical history
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.040]   that includes doctor appointments, visit notes.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.080]   I wish I had this, prescriptions.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.320]   You can get do phone calls with a doctor right from the app.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.080]   It also helps you find doctors and care in your area.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.480]   By location, languages, spoken hospital affiliation, et cetera.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.640]   iOS only right now.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.960]   Android's coming in January.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:23.960]   I want you to check it out, highosker.com/twit.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.520]   Oscar's plans focus on you and your family.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.640]   They include free checkups, some free generic drugs,
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.760]   free primary care, doctor visits and more.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.760]   You don't need to referral to get care.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.400]   You don't have to go to your primary care
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.680]   and go to the Oscars like having a doctor in the family.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.880]   And doctor on call from Oscar
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.320]   gives you access to a board certified doctor 24/7.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.000]   I'm doing this act 'cause while they're in New York
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:46.880]   and New York and New Jersey right now,
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.920]   which are big metro centers,
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.440]   I want them to succeed and roll out everywhere.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.360]   So if you're in New York and New Jersey,
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:57.360]   visit highosker.com/twit or call 1-844-OSKER-25.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:02.600]   If you sign up for Oscar by the 15th of next month,
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.800]   you will be insured by the first of the following month.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:10.800]   Highosker.com/twit or 844-OSKER-25.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.480]   We are back to the news.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.440]   Google is being asked to extend the right
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.240]   to be forgotten worldwide.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.360]   This is another one of them European things,
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.680]   and it makes sense, you can't do the right to be forgotten.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.520]   If somebody could just say,
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.080]   "Well, I'm gonna go to google.com and find it."
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.080]   But really, this to me is a problem.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.480]   This will break the internet,
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   or at least break Google,
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.200]   which as far as I'm concerned breaks the internet.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:41.760]   Because if you can request that information
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.000]   taken down from every Google server,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.240]   basically one country's laws are enforced globally.
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.920]   I think that's a problem.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.000]   - Well, it can be a good or a bad.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.760]   I mean, that concept, I mean, that's how--
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.160]   - Well, there's some things I would like to be forgotten.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.200]   - Well, yeah.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   - As Jeff Jarvis points out on this week in Google,
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.880]   he says, "You think Germany's like a country
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.920]   "that really should not be promoting the idea
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.040]   "that we want to forget our history."
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.760]   And I think he's right.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.920]   And in fact, that's very much part
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.600]   of the modern German ethos is,
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.520]   "Let's not bury the past, right?"
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.040]   Unless it's a Google search.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.400]   - Well, how, yeah, hello, Henry, now.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.920]   - God, he's 19.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.840]   - Well, I was just wondering,
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.360]   like, kids who are probably 26, 27,
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.720]   they grew up with the internet.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:25.560]   You know, they've got all that stuff.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.560]   - Certainly he did, yeah.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.640]   - To be embarrassed.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.120]   Well, how are they handling it?
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:29.960]   What are they doing?
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.240]   - Well, I think that whether you inhaled or not
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.120]   is not gonna be important in the future.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.320]   Whether you went to a party in more funny hat
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.040]   and got wasted and then put it on Facebook, we all did.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:40.880]   - Well, and that's the thing.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.040]   It's like all those scary stories about teacher fired
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.800]   for photo of her holding yellow, red solo cup.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:46.760]   - That's old fashioned.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:49.200]   - Right, and so, you know, it's the issue of,
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.080]   is that anonymity going to be an issue?
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.640]   I think it is a little bit classic
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.840]   because right now the only way to get forgotten
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.760]   is to bury yourself with, you know,
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.280]   sort of the reputation.com approach to bury yourself.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.280]   - And that is not effective.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.320]   It's very expensive.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.840]   You have to pay them thousands of dollars a month
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.600]   and they basically make fake articles
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.240]   and fill the internet with fake stuff on your name,
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.640]   hoping to bury the other stuff.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.400]   - Yeah, I know someone who did it.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.240]   - Did it work?
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.720]   - It did because he was early enough in the process
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.600]   that it was still sort of cat and mouse
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.520]   and he got ahead of their algorithm, but.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.440]   - Hey, share it with the world.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:23.280]   What was he trying to hide?
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.280]   - No, you can't do it.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.400]   Wouldn't be prudent.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.080]   - I got a few things I'd like to hide.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.040]   You know who would like to hide some stuff?
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.880]   Uber.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.400]   - Oh, what a fuck.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.520]   - Uber, now did you have you?
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.280]   Okay.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.120]   - I deleted.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.440]   - You did.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.320]   - Did you delete?
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.360]   - I don't think I haven't installed
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.840]   'cause I've only used it like two times.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:42.720]   - Yeah, I've used it twice.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.240]   It was in France and then we don't have it where we are.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.560]   I think we do now.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.960]   Do we have Uber up here?
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.800]   - Yeah, everywhere.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.080]   I mean, it's day by day.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.640]   - They have to drive up from San Francisco.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.800]   You're not gonna get it right right away.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.640]   - Really?
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.840]   - We had a guest on all that Android.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.400]   - There's drive right in the Sonoma County, yeah.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.560]   - So now I don't have that excuse anymore.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.640]   - No, the good news is that Lyft has announced
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.000]   that the FISBump is no longer mandatory.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.160]   They're de-emphasizing that they already de-emphasize.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.000]   - They're just the pink mustache.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:09.840]   - Right in there.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.200]   - And they're saying you can sit back to you.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.880]   - You had to give the driver a fist bump?
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.560]   - The driver was gonna ask you for a fist bump.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.400]   So basically--
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.280]   - That's a reason not to ride a lift right there.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.120]   And the pink mustache.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.480]   - The pink mustache was enough for me
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.240]   to be like, forget these guys, they're jokers.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.200]   And they're trying very hard to get away from that
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.600]   'cause they sense an opening now.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.440]   - Yeah.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   - Do you think the world knows about this whole Uberka fuffle?
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.080]   - It went big.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:32.920]   - It did.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.760]   - Oh yeah.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.360]   I mean, it was just bad behavior.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.160]   - Is there a general, oh, it was terrible behavior,
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.560]   but is there a general feeling among regular people
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.440]   that I'm not gonna use Uber
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.280]   because I don't wanna support the company?
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.240]   I'm afraid of using Uber, that kind of thing?
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.080]   - Number two.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:46.920]   - Number two.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.760]   - Yeah.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.600]   - They feel it's not safe.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.760]   - Afraid because of tracking, afraid because of bad behavior,
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:55.760]   afraid because of the walk of shame aspect of it
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:56.760]   that they were promoting.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:00.200]   That was kinda creepy, that they had data on, okay,
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.960]   you went someplace at 2 a.m.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.960]   and then you left at 7 a.m.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.120]   And they had some sort of, you know, that kind of stuff.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:12.120]   Is that data collection and filtering is creepy?
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:14.680]   Not to mention their problem with women
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.360]   and all the other issues, the Sarah Lacey thing
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:20.920]   that came out, I think they just, they bombed.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   They got way too big in there.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.280]   - Did Uber censure the New York executive
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.640]   who used tracking to?
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.560]   - They took disciplinary action of some sort.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.520]   - Oh, I really trust them.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.360]   - Yeah, you can't tweet first.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.760]   - They don't say what it was though, do they?
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   - No.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.280]   - Don't say stupid stuff anymore.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.480]   - An email Michael, the guy who got in trouble.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.600]   - He has, or Lacey. - He's a lady, penalty.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.240]   - No, as far as we know at least.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.080]   - Yeah.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.360]   - I don't think us getting upset about Uber
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:44.760]   is going to make a huge difference,
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.560]   but I think there is this perception of them
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.840]   that used to be more positive,
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.200]   that is going to be reflected in future coverage of them.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.960]   There was the sense that they were the one hope
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.160]   fighting against entrenched taxi companies.
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.840]   And now everybody's taking a step back and saying,
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.000]   "Are they too big?
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.440]   "Should we be looking at alternatives to Uber as well?
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.320]   "We were giving them too much credit."
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.080]   So I do think this will have a long-term impact on them
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.360]   of some sort.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.760]   I don't think it's like everybody's going to delete Uber
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.520]   off their phones tomorrow and it's over for them at all,
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.240]   but I do think they're not,
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.600]   they don't have the halo around them
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   and people who cover them are not as predisposed maybe
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.920]   to give them the benefit of the doubt
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.560]   because they've done too many things that are so jerky
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.680]   for them to get away with it.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.320]   - Okay, so here's a little quick lightning round.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.560]   CEO, tech CEO, bad behavior.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.120]   So one that comes to mind is Mark Pincus talking about
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.560]   all of the crushing competition
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.080]   and how he was just trying to steal people's money,
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.480]   who was using his dumb games.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.320]   You know, that's one that comes to mind.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.160]   - Whatever happened is Zinga.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.680]   - Harry, any that you can think of?
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.760]   Jason, tech CEO, bad behavior that really impacted him.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.440]   - There was one CEO of a--
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.800]   - Mark Heard, Spide-On.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.280]   - Mark Heard, journalists and--
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.880]   - Pre-texting and it got in trouble.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.720]   - He got fired.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.200]   - He didn't get fired for some kind of journalists.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.040]   He got fired for supposedly--
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:02.880]   - Messing with somebody.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.440]   - Oh, that's right, that's right.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.440]   - But by the way now, that was pre-heard.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.400]   - He is Larry Ellison's successor at Oregon.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.960]   So he landed on his feet.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.000]   - That didn't go so badly.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.040]   - I mean, Mark Zuckerberg used to get in trouble
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.400]   at regular LA and people said,
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.200]   I'm gonna quit Facebook over this.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.280]   And oddly enough, Facebook's membership
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.720]   just grew and grew and grew.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.560]   - Right.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.480]   - It's really more sensible.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.320]   - It's more as--
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.160]   - It's more as--
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.000]   - It's more as--
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.840]   - It's more as--
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.680]   - That's the CEO, bad behavior
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.520]   that you're talking about right?
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.360]   - Oh, it's just interesting.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.200]   - No, I don't know, the CEO--
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.040]   - When you reflect.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.400]   - The problem is when the CEO's behavior is mirrored
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.720]   and the behavior of people down the chain.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.560]   - Yeah.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.400]   - And it's a corporate culture issue.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.240]   - That's right.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.400]   - 'Cause then you start getting a weird feeling.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.840]   And maybe if it's a company that makes your software
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.000]   and it's software that you use
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.240]   and you can brush it off,
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.600]   I think I've heard from people who think,
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600]   you're putting yourself,
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.040]   your life in their hands in a way
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.160]   by signing up for the service
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.640]   and getting in a car with their drivers.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.880]   And there is, whether it's realistic or not,
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.000]   there's this feeling like there's a partnership
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.320]   and there's a trust level there.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.560]   And so to have a culture issue
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.720]   with a company that you feel like
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.000]   you're putting some trust in,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.840]   that is a problem.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.680]   - Nailed it.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.520]   Because you know why?
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.800]   I think that Uber has a barrier to entry
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.600]   with normal people,
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.840]   which is I'm using my phone to call someone to--
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.680]   - I don't know.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.880]   - To request information of someone
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.480]   who's not been vetted by anyone.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.440]   - Once you use Uber once.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.160]   And you then go back to writing a taxi
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.760]   which we did this weekend in San Francisco
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.320]   'cause Lisa would not use Uber.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.200]   It was a horrible experience.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.120]   (laughing)
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.320]   - I don't like the taxis, son.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.720]   - You think taxis are better than Uber?
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.120]   - No, it's just a different, it's a different--
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.600]   - I think what people experience Uber,
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.120]   they want that friction-free experience.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.600]   They don't want the fist bump.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.720]   But they certainly like the idea of pressing a button
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.440]   knowing when their car's gonna arrive.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.360]   Getting in that car, it's a nice clean car,
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.480]   driver's nice.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.720]   You can rate the driver right,
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.080]   so if the drivers are jerks, they're out of business.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.120]   He can rate you.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.440]   If you're a jerk, you're out of business
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.240]   and you don't have to pay him,
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.080]   you just get out of the car when you're right.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.440]   - But you said once you try.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.120]   You think people won't try it now because of this?
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.680]   - There's a social contract with a taxi
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.280]   that is hundreds of years old and well-established.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.440]   And so breaking that to engage in a new social contract
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.440]   with a company that's suddenly gotten shaky on their morals
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.360]   I think is a barrier to entry times two.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.240]   - I think Uber makes for an interesting contrast
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.400]   with Airbnb, which has worked so hard
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.440]   to create this warm, fuzzy image
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.960]   that they're making a world a better place
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.960]   by introducing strangers to each other.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.760]   - Uber up until a couple of weeks ago was almost glorying
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.040]   and having an abrasive, unpleasant, sassy culture.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.080]   And I think that is probably over.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.840]   - But isn't it the case if you're a startup,
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.400]   especially a startup like Uber,
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.600]   that is fighting against a deeply entrenched incumbent
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.200]   like the taxi commissions of the world?
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.080]   They were just banned in the state of Nevada.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:43.920]   - Right, and Uber had--
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.760]   - They were just banned in Toronto.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.040]   - Uber has to be pushing unpleasant on some level.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:47.880]   - Absolutely.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.560]   - They had to have that scrappy mentality that,
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.200]   yeah, it's us against the,
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.640]   it's the David versus the Goliath, we're David.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.480]   - But Airbnb-- - But now they're
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.440]   a $40 billion David.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.200]   - Airbnb has some of those same challenges
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.880]   'cause they're fighting the hotel industry.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.720]   - Right.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.880]   - And they've managed to do that.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.720]   - Do you think I was conscious?
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.560]   I think it's conscious.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.400]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.360]   - We're the anti-uber.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.840]   Although we've just learned that 19 people
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.000]   make the blind share of money from Airbnb.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.800]   These are the big businesses that have become Airbnb businesses.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.400]   19 individuals make more than half of all the money,
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.120]   wasn't that it, that Airbnb?
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.120]   So maybe they're not the scrappy little guy either.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.760]   - Well, they-- - Maybe that's a myth
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.360]   around the company that's bringing people together.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.200]   It's bringing, it's formed a new,
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.240]   it's created a new form of entrepreneurship, which is--
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.440]   - It's just very conscious on their part.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.920]   It's the brand that they have created.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.760]   - It's a brand thing.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.000]   - But it's working for them.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.840]   - Yeah.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.760]   - Give me a wrist.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.080]   - Uh-oh, are you gonna electrocute me?
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.480]   - I am, I brought this for you.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.200]   - So we talked about this on the show.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.840]   Becky Worley does these reviews for Good Morning America,
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.160]   and this was what Smartwatches--
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.840]   - Yeah, and this one I did a little bit on GMM
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.640]   and a little bit on Yahoo.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.360]   So let's imagine that you have a Fitbit--
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.680]   - I'm really nervous.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.960]   - Or a, this is the Pavlock, that's on the Pavlock.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.120]   - It's a fitness band.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.720]   - It could be a fitness band, but it's a motivational tool.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.520]   So let's just work with it in the fitness band.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.320]   Let's say that you've told your Fitbit
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.640]   or your whatever that you wanna do 10,000 steps a day
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.760]   by 4.30 in the afternoon.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.760]   Well, if you don't do it by 4.30, it does this.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.560]   - Nothing?
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.400]   - Nothing?
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.240]   - Oh, I'm gonna do a fast hold on.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.680]   - Just try and pain.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.520]   (laughing)
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.840]   - There you go, there you go.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.960]   - When my mom gave me my dinner, right?
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.200]   - That's terrible.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.040]   - It hurts, right?
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.760]   - That is terrible, you shocked me.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:37.160]   It's like a bad static shock.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.400]   You know, when you touch the dog's nose
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.280]   after you walk on the carpet, it's on that one.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.760]   - It's 220.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.520]   - It's 220, but it's brief.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.320]   - Yeah, but it's not--
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.800]   - And you are brave to have done that.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.200]   I didn't know what I was getting into,
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.760]   so I don't get any-- - That's how much I love you.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.600]   - I don't get any credit for being brave, but that hurt.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.440]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.800]   - It wasn't like a taser. - You're not a taser.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800]   - You hurt like a taser.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.640]   - This is good luck, hasn't it?
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.480]   - No.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.840]   - It's not that way.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.880]   - No needles, come here, Nia.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.440]   So by the way, I love it that Becky does this,
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.240]   and you're right, it was Yahoo or not GMA that we--
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.320]   We actually reviewed this.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.160]   - It hurts.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.000]   - But you're a tough person.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.880]   You don't, you know, you're a mom, you're a rugby player.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.480]   - How many knee operations have you had?
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.760]   - I've had six knee surgeries, 15 broken bones,
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.040]   and I gave birth to twins, and it hurt.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.560]   - And this little watch.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.120]   Do you wanna try it, Jeff?
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.960]   - Come on. - Come on.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.800]   - Kevin and Jeff.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.040]   - It's surprising. - Jeff will try,
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.360]   we love Jeff, he'll try anything.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.280]   - And I wanna say--
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.560]   - It's like a spinal tap drummer.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.400]   - Here, come on, we're gonna--
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.240]   - You got another one waiting.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.080]   - But you know how it goes.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.920]   You can do this now, it's not only a negative reinforcement.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.240]   There's also, it's actually--
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.960]   - Jeff works for me, so I'm gonna make you do it.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.800]   - Okay, come here, right.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.040]   - 'Cause I don't wanna get sued for some sort of--
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.240]   - You're a little nervous?
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.080]   - You're a little nervous?
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.920]   Okay, so let's get this a good contact point.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.040]   - Yeah, make sure it's tight on the first.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:48.880]   - That's right.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.880]   - Hey, feel it?
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.880]   - Hey! - Do you feel it?
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.720]   - Yeah, I feel it.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.040]   - Hey!
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.560]   - See, I'm like the sadest person in the first time.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.720]   - It made me jump.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.560]   - Yeah.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.640]   - See, you-- - I didn't do it that time.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.800]   - Why? - I felt it the first time.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.640]   - You felt the best-- - You didn't make it tight.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.480]   - They could make it tighter.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.320]   - Yeah, they could make it tighter.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.880]   - They get tighter. - I'm so mean.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.800]   - You don't wanna try this.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.640]   - You're doing it. - But you know what,
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:14.000]   that would motivate me. - It didn't make it that adjust.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.040]   - Did it make your hand go a little bit of a contraction?
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.400]   I won't do it anymore.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.240]   - No, it doesn't.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.480]   - I can't abuse a man in a sweater like this.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.320]   - Yeah, that's his eagle's stance.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   - Eagle's Christmas?
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.280]   Okay, all right, yeah, goin' with that.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.280]   - Christmas-y, isn't it?
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.360]   - I've just shocked a person in a Christmas sweater.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.680]   I feel evil.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.840]   I'm so mean.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.320]   - I know, I wanna be an eagle.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.720]   - I know, I wanna be an epiple,
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.320]   so I don't have a free rush for it.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.840]   - Oh, yes, it's so--
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.320]   - I love the name Pavlok,
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.040]   because it's like Pavlov's dog.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:41.880]   - Right.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.440]   - And it's a personal coach on your wrist.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.880]   I think, is it safe?
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.280]   - It's, is it safe?
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.120]   (laughs)
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:47.960]   Yes, it's very, very safe.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:48.800]   - It's safe, right?
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.640]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.480]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.320]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.160]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.000]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.840]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.680]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.520]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.360]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.200]   - Is it safe?
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   - Is it safe as a fitness span?
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.240]   - They still, this is not available for purchase.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.960]   He's still well in development.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.000]   - But you would tie it to a smart app.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.680]   - So the app, you can do multiple things.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.480]   A monetary, a social, and a--
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.320]   - I think I need something that has punishment.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.400]   - A punitive aspect.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.120]   So monetary one is, and this is how packed works.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.000]   You say you're gonna go to the gym or do 10,000 steps,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.600]   and you put five bucks in.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.440]   - Yeah.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.840]   - It debits it from your PayPal.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.960]   - Five bucks, no big deal.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.120]   - If you don't do it, it takes it.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:24.960]   - Big deal.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.120]   - You can, well, say--
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:26.960]   - Shock me would do it.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.320]   - Where does the five bucks go?
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.560]   - It goes to the rest of the pool of people
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.960]   who are using it, who do use it.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.800]   That's about packed works.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.200]   - So if you do it, you get paid?
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.520]   If you do it, you get, this is packed.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.680]   If you do it, you get paid.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.200]   If you don't do it, you lose the money.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.800]   So that's one way of motivating you.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.120]   - Oh, I might do that.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:43.960]   What is that?
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.800]   P-A-C-T?
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.640]   - P-A-C-T.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.920]   And then, so this is a little bit of that built into it.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.120]   And then it also has the, you have to check in
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.680]   with a friend who then checks you in.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.120]   So you have to call a friend and say,
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.480]   I didn't go to the gym.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.080]   And then they, you two have a deal going.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.480]   So you have to be accountable to another human.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.560]   - Can your friend have control of the electric shock?
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.440]   - And then the electric shock is the third method
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.280]   that it uses.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.440]   - But could like I give Lisa,
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.280]   is which she really wants this, by the way.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.960]   Could I give her the electric shock?
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.360]   - See, that's funny, 'cause that's not how
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.120]   I would have seen your relationships going.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.960]   (laughing)
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.400]   - Oh, how little you know.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.680]   - Do you know when it's gonna shock you,
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.440]   or is it at some random point in time,
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.080]   so you can't just take it off?
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.120]   - When I beta tested it, it doesn't,
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.880]   it's not built that way yet.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880]   It's still like--
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.200]   - It sounds like it's very early.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.200]   - Yeah, it's very early.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.960]   - Now, packed is real, packed is now.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.920]   - Packed is real.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.720]   I met a woman who lost 85 pounds.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.680]   - I wanna do the Jim-packed P-A-C-T.com.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.640]   And you put it on your phone, Android or iOS,
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   and then it takes your money, or gives you money.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.000]   - Yep.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.840]   - I think I could, I think this would be good for me.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.320]   - And I don't know if they have this,
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.120]   but there are other sites where they'll donate it
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.120]   'cause of you hate. - It's pathetic.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.400]   - Oh, really? - Yeah, so not only
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.920]   will they take your money, but they'll donate it to like--
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.960]   - Oh, wow. - It's gonna send
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.320]   money to the Koch brothers or something.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.880]   - Then Lisa would press that button all the time.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.160]   - So, wow.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.040]   - I think it's just interesting, HCI,
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.680]   and kind of bringing in levels of--
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.400]   - I think it's how messed up we've become,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.520]   that we just can't bring ourselves to do anything.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.840]   So now we need some outside electric shock.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840]   - Well, okay, get this.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.760]   So the guy who made the Pavlock,
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.160]   the way this started was he had some big thing
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.800]   that he had to get done, and he was so procrastinating on it.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:28.640]   - Oh, I'm terrible with it.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.880]   - But on Craigslist, he hired someone to come slap him.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.840]   (laughing)
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.480]   - It worked? - It worked.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.880]   I don't know if it was a great story.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.920]   - Or a project or whatever,
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.560]   he hired someone to come slap him.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.320]   And so he made him so nervous, the slapping,
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.920]   and the social interaction around the slapping,
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.520]   and all that, that he decided if I could just come up
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.240]   with something that had a negative reinforcement,
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.400]   some people need negative reinforcement.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.880]   - You're smart, you made a vine of this,
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.640]   so I can watch it shock you over and over and over.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.120]   - How much fun to watch a blonde get shocked over.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.760]   - Over and over and over.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.720]   - This could be a great business for Uber to move into,
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.040]   or somebody comes over with an Uber to slap you.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.280]   - If I get the fist bump, we're gonna shock you.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.280]   (laughing)
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.480]   We're gonna slug you.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.120]   - Just slap, slap car.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.440]   - Can I get underwear with that?
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.040]   - Whoa, moving into a nude.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.640]   That's a whole not a big thing.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.440]   - I'm gonna fill out a capture for that, wait.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.200]   (laughing)
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.160]   - Wow, wow.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.120]   So, leave it to me, whenever I come onto it,
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.240]   I gotta do a little Gallagher,
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.400]   I gotta bring you some props.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.240]   - That's good. - You know,
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.280]   when I first saw this, I kind of laughed as we all did.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.520]   Now I want it.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.680]   - Okay, well, I'll tell you why I just--
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.880]   - I don't want that, I'm gonna do a gym pact.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.720]   - Gym pact is good.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.720]   - I don't really wanna get shocked a lot,
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.760]   I'm afraid it might stop my heart at some point.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.600]   - Let me tell you this.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.440]   - Or start your heart.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.400]   - Hey, everyone.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.480]   - Look at this thing, and let me put it back on your arm.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   How does that make you feel?
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.680]   - Don't do it, Leo, don't do it, it's a trap.
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.640]   - I'm gonna do whatever it takes, not ten, I think, shocked me.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.280]   - I'm not putting it on there, but just that feeling,
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.600]   that's how I felt, that I knew that it was a positive,
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.520]   it was gonna really work.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   'Cause when I thought about the thing on my arm,
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.040]   it made me nervous.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.440]   And I thought, wow, that's a really,
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.560]   that's a visceral feeling that goes beyond that,
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.920]   sort of, you know, how we put off the things
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.720]   that we really wanna do by the more immediate things that--
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.280]   - Three-toed sloth in our chat room says,
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.200]   just like his name, I just wanna say that again.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.200]   - Three-toed sloth in our chat room, what did he say?
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.960]   - Like a nine-volt battery if you're cheap.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.520]   - He said if you're cheap, lick a nine-volt battery.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.280]   You don't need the watch.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.120]   - That's good.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.960]   - It's worse than licking a nine-volt battery.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.320]   - It is, that just tastes like metal.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.160]   - Well, it'll give you a little tongue tingle.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.800]   This ain't no tongue tingle.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.080]   - No.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.560]   - This is like the worst static shock you've ever had.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.600]   - That's right, right?
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.440]   - That's right.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.280]   - Would you say that?
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.080]   - Well, it also, I mean, I was impressed by
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.480]   Christmas sweater guy because he didn't jerk away
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.280]   'cause I couldn't help myself.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.880]   - He probably doesn't have any nerve endings.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.040]   He's worked for us too long.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.320]   - Maybe there was a hair barrier.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.920]   - I think the Philly connection there also is.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.760]   - He's from Philly.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.160]   - Right, for him you gotta throw like batteries at him.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.000]   - He's from Philly.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:05.840]   - Yeah, right.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.800]   - Otherwise he's fine.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.280]   - Wow.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.680]   I still haven't been up.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.280]   He, by the way, he's joined Jim Pekt already.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.120]   - Oh, he has.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:13.960]   - But you know, I saw Jeff,
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.840]   I saw him get excited about it.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.280]   He's not excited about paying the money.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.800]   He knows he's gonna get one.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.640]   - He's gonna get one.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.200]   - And that's all he really carried.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.840]   I'm gonna get five bucks.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.760]   I'm going in there to get the five bucks.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:29.080]   What is your resolution gonna be?
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.080]   What are you gonna do?
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.360]   Go to the gym every day?
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.200]   - Three days a week.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.280]   - Three days a week.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.880]   Nice, that's good.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.880]   Tell me how it works 'cause I've met people
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.360]   that it worked for them but I'd like to know,
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.320]   you know, on the more data that you have.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.800]   Those are good apps.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.640]   These are good.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.760]   - Can you make it a hundred bucks?
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.600]   - Sure.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600]   - 'Cause that it hurt.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.600]   - That it hurt.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.200]   - I know it's $10 by Mrs. Day.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.200]   - Yeah, but what if I make it a hundred dollars?
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.200]   - It's a hundred dollars.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.680]   - You can set it for a hundred dollars
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:54.680]   if you miss it then.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.520]   - Yeah.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.360]   - That would hurt.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.160]   Five bucks I'm gonna go, it's worth it.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.600]   Not to go to the gym.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.640]   That has to be more than the it's worth it number,
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.560]   whatever that is.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.400]   - Yeah.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.240]   - Can you set the amount?
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.240]   - Uh-huh.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.120]   - If you're a rich, did you do 500 or whatever?
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.840]   - One more thing on Uber and I don't know
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:11.960]   whether this is bad or not.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.120]   Maybe we'll get the panel of experts to explain.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.040]   Uber's Android app goes out and Twitter's gonna do
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.760]   this too and looks at every app on your phone
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.080]   to see what you got.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.560]   Looks at all the data it can get.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.720]   Now, we've seen before and I've always calmed people down
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.480]   when they look at the Android permissions
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:36.160]   'cause Android requires you to request a lot of stuff.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.560]   Even if you wanna do one little thing
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.280]   it's kind of got a big umbrella category
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.120]   and people look at it and go,
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.160]   my God, it's gonna make phone calls.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.000]   No, it's not.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.440]   It just needs to be able to access the dialer or whatever.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.200]   But this looks like according to JirenSec
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:53.200]   the Uber app actually calls home and sends data back
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.240]   to Uber about your SMS log, your call history,
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.800]   your Wi-Fi connections, your GPS locations,
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.080]   your device ID.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.400]   It's a long list.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.000]   Now, this is the Android version.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.400]   - Did you say neighbors Wi-Fi?
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.320]   That was the one that creeped me.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.440]   - Wi-Fi neighbors.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.720]   So it's not just the Wi-Fi you're connected to.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.800]   It's the Wi-Fi in your vicinity.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.480]   You could make the case that Uber's trying to make
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.120]   a kind of a sky hook style map location map
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.720]   or something like that.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.920]   But really does this seem like,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.600]   again, this seems like more bad behavior from Uber.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.320]   That's a lot of information.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.720]   Battery level, health, device info.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.680]   I mean, this is a ton of stuff.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.360]   This is from the Cult of Mac.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.520]   Uber has provided some clarification
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.480]   to the company's data gathering.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.200]   It mentions that the blanket access
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.400]   is actually a requirement from Google.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.160]   Access to permissions including Wi-Fi networks
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.800]   and camera included so users can experience
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.360]   a full functionality of the Uber app.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.560]   This is not unique to Uber and I'd agree with that.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.520]   But in fact, Recode notes the Uber competitor lift
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.120]   does require the same access.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.520]   So I'm unclear.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.960]   It sounds like this company that,
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.560]   Jaron's sect that revealed this saw data
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.760]   of a variety of kinds being sent.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.760]   And that's the problem.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.840]   Asking for the permission is one thing.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.480]   Everybody needs to do that.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.140]   It's what actually happened.
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:24.520]   So we'll just have to see.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.200]   - But this is what I mean about how Uber has lost
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.560]   some of the benefit of a doubt from any story now, right?
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.080]   This might be something that we shrugged off
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.860]   and it's like, look, it's just another Android
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:33.840]   app permission story.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.680]   It's not that big a deal.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.840]   This happens all the time.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.520]   But now it's sort of like, oh well, it's Uber.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.360]   You never know what it might be doing.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360]   - Right.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.760]   Well, we'll watch that one and see what happens there.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.800]   Maybe that they're just doing what everybody else is doing
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.040]   which is asking for.
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:46.880]   Like a creation.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.440]   - Which is stealing all of your personal data
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.720]   and using it for unknown purposes.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.560]   - Twitter has said.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.800]   - Like everybody else really.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.000]   - Twitter has said it's gonna look at what apps you have.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.600]   - Don't you assume that with OAuth
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.200]   that if you're using,
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.560]   now it's not just if you're using your Twitter identity
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.400]   to log on, they're gonna look at everything.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.960]   - Well, what it's looking for is the URL registrations
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.840]   in your system.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:13.440]   So it knows what apps have registered for URL schemes,
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.480]   I believe is what they're doing.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.240]   - And Facebook does this already with all the apps
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.320]   that you're-- - Yeah, these are apps
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.760]   that you have logged into with Twitter
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.840]   and you've given Twitter permission.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.560]   - No, I believe you've installed them on your phone
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.600]   and they route the apps register for a URL handler.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.720]   Like you could, so you can pass,
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.880]   it's like on iOS how Inter-App communication has.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.960]   - This is what Twitter wrote
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.440]   to help build a more personal Twitter experience for you.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.400]   We are collecting and occasionally updating
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.600]   the list of apps installed on your mobile device
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.360]   so we can deliver tailored content
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.080]   you might be interested in.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.160]   - I think that's the idea that if somebody posts a link
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.040]   to Facebook or Evernote or something else
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.160]   where there's a sort of a URL format,
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.800]   if they know that you have the app,
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.680]   then when you tap on the link in their app,
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.960]   it will just open that app up instead of opening.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.000]   It'll rewrite the URL to be an app URL,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:02.840]   if that makes any sense.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.640]   - That I would understand and forgive,
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.720]   but they gave examples including improving suggestions
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.040]   on who to follow based on similar interests.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.920]   - Yeah, well, that's less cool, isn't it?
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.160]   Adding content to the timelines of users
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.640]   such as tweets and accounts that could prove
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.320]   to be interesting to the user,
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.000]   showing you promoted content that's more relevant.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.620]   You've got, we see you have angry birds installed,
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.240]   would you like to perhaps buy the product
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.080]   red level of angry birds?
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.080]   - That's so nice of Twitter.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.760]   - Well, we can opt out.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.480]   - The best thing about Twitter is that I get to decide
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.600]   what might be relevant to me rather than Twitter,
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.720]   which makes it so different from Facebook.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.400]   And so my main concern is not that they're invading
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.760]   my privacy so much as they're getting a little bit too clever.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.280]   I'd rather find people to follow myself.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.800]   - It's so good to do this show with you guys.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.720]   You just boil it down so quickly.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.560]   - They're good, aren't they?
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.360]   - It really tells you why they're in this business
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.200]   as long as they have.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.800]   You get it, you can take any story and automatically.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:54.640]   - They're brilliant.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.840]   And you too, like you were, like you too.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.440]   Twitter says we are only collecting
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.040]   a list of applications you've installed.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.400]   So they are collecting a list of applications you've installed.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.440]   - Yeah, so my understanding is this is happening
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.480]   through this URL handler registry on iOS at least,
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.000]   where apps register for URLs and you can ask
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.240]   to see what URL formats have been registered,
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.400]   at which point you know what apps register those URLs
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.400]   and you've got a list.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.360]   - So if you don't want this to happen,
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.280]   using Twitter for Android, tap the overflow icon,
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.160]   tap settings, tap the account you'd like to adjust.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.880]   Under other, you can adjust the setting
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.000]   to Taylor Twitter based on my apps.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.280]   - So five steps to opt out.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.600]   - But you can turn it off.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.440]   - Right.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.760]   - On iOS from the Me tab, tap the,
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.840]   it's so hard to figure out what Twitter's app is doing,
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.240]   but tap the gear icon, tap settings,
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.800]   tap the account under privacy,
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.920]   adjust the settings to Taylor Twitter based on my apps.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.040]   So there will be a new setting,
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.480]   look for it in your Twitter app on iOS and Android
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.240]   and you might want to turn off Taylor Twitter
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.560]   based on my apps.
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.600]   That's hubris, isn't it?
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.040]   That seems like hubris.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.120]   We're just going to look at your apps
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.480]   so we can give you better people to follow.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.480]   - I mean, you can opt out.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.320]   I mean, it's exactly what it looks like.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.160]   - You can opt out.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.000]   - You can always delete that.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.600]   - You don't have to.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.440]   Well, by the way, I'm not going to use a Twitter.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.400]   I used to use a Twitter app.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.320]   Thank God, there's still a few third party apps
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.680]   like Tapbot.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.120]   - Not for long.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:17.960]   - Tweetbot.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.640]   - Not for long because all of the new features Twitter adds,
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.000]   they add without an API.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:22.840]   - Right.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.200]   - So more and more, I mean, on the Mac,
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.600]   I'm using the stock Twitter app now
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.640]   because I want to use that.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.840]   I want to see retweets that they have.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.680]   - I use a Tweetbot?
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.040]   - No.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.360]   I never really liked Tweetbot.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.000]   - I've reluctantly moved off Tweetbot
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.880]   and on to the Twitter app, although on Android,
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.720]   I cannot make heads or tails out of the official.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.600]   - There's no good app on Android for Twitter.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.160]   - I'm still using Twitterific on iOS,
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.360]   but on the desktop on Mac, I'm using Twitter
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.320]   because the notifications tab is so great
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.880]   and that information is not available to third parties.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.480]   - Let us take a break, come back with more.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.160]   Becky Worley is here from Good Morning America
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.120]   and Yahoo Tech.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.280]   Great to have you.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.760]   Becky, for many years, worked with me at Tech TV.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.160]   - You're a producer there.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.080]   - A lot of it behind the scenes.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.360]   You were a producer for both Call for Help
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.480]   and the Screen Savers and you know Jason Stell
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.760]   because it was during that time that Jason came on
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:08.880]   as a Mac world editor.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.720]   - Mac Tip.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.760]   - Well one of your producers I went to kindergarten with.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.760]   - Jerry, right?
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.600]   - That's right.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.440]   - Jerry Rice.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.280]   - Jerry Rice.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.120]   - Jerry Rice.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.360]   - No, I did not go to kindergarten with Jerry Rice.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.680]   - Jerry is Jerry Rice.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.760]   Jerry Kelowna.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.320]   - We used to play in a Columbia Elementary School play
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.160]   for the Nerf Day.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.000]   - I did.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:26.840]   - I remember it.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:27.680]   - I would throw the Nerf football to Jerry Rice
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.520]   in the playground.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.360]   - Yeah.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.040]   - Was there a Tech TV reunion that I missed that?
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:31.880]   - Yes.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.280]   We missed you.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.280]   - You know May 11th of next year will be
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.400]   the 15th anniversary of the launch.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.240]   - Yes, 1990.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.080]   - We should do something.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:40.920]   - Let's do it.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:41.760]   - I missed the 10th.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.600]   - Okay, let's do 15th.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.080]   - Yeah, and I'd like to do that.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:44.920]   - Roger Dodger.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:45.760]   - Roger Dodger.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.680]   Harry McCracken, the technologist is also here
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:51.680]   from his new job at--
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.520]   - Fast Company.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.880]   - Be fast company.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.720]   Nice to have you.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.280]   What is your beat at Fast Company?
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.280]   - I have a very vague beat which lets me do
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.000]   almost anything I'd like to and we call it platforms.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   So it's iOS.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:02.840]   - Nice.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.240]   - Android, it covers Facebook, Microsoft,
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.720]   almost anything that involves levels of technology.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.680]   So chips, devices, operating system.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.680]   - I think that's actually the most interesting.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:13.520]   - Yeah.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.600]   - You can talk specifically about Uber and Twitter,
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.480]   but what really is interesting is ride sharing
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.920]   or social media.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.760]   That's where the trends are.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.600]   That's where the interesting stuff is.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.880]   - It's less to be covered wearables
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.800]   and the internet of things
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.760]   'cause those are all about platforms.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.720]   - Yeah.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.160]   I'm using the Moto 360.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.560]   That seems to me the best of the bunch.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.360]   I was wearing the Galaxy Gear S for the last three or four days.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.760]   God, is that a big clunky?
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.680]   - Yeah, what do you think?
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.240]   - A clunky thing.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.240]   - So yeah, we got--
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.600]   - It has its own phone number.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.920]   - Really?
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.480]   - In fact, they suggest you forward your phone to your watch,
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.640]   which seems like a bad idea.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.040]   - Wow.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.400]   - But yeah, wow.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.240]   - Don't know.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.440]   - Wow, that's right.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.560]   What do you wear, Pebble?
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.400]   - I do.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.920]   My battery died 'cause my Thanksgiving guests
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.000]   unplugged my charger.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.360]   - Son of a gun.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.200]   - It lasts a week, but not long ago.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.440]   - It's just hate it when family comes in
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.360]   and tries to improve your life.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.520]   - They've ruined, they decluttered.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.400]   - Those cables are gone now.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.240]   - It was an idea.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.800]   - It was helpful.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:08.880]   - Really?
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.720]   - Is it a relative?
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.560]   - I think it was an accident.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.720]   I think I just popped it out of the wall,
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.240]   but it was a sad trombone sound.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.800]   - It just came and it took all your cords.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.640]   Harry, what do you wear?
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:18.480]   Do you wear a smartwax?
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.280]   - I drop back and forth and I'm wearing a Pebble,
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.720]   which I put on a leather band.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.560]   - Yeah.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:23.400]   - And a Moment.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.320]   - Pebble has gotten a lot better lately,
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.600]   partially 'cause of things they've done,
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.920]   but also stuff like the Health Stuff Apple
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.600]   has done in iOS, helps.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.920]   Now you can use the JobZone app with Pebble,
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.240]   what you couldn't do until recently.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.240]   - That's great.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.080]   - Yeah.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.080]   Pebble was somewhat rudimentary when it came out
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.920]   and little by little, it gets better.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.200]   - I have to go back and try it.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.200]   I give it a chat.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.760]   I like the Moto 360 and you wear the Pavlock.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.240]   (laughs)
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.280]   - I have Casio Dive Watch that I destroyed while surfing.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.320]   I'm that bad, but I have to go back to tech TV
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.480]   and tell you this, that I go surfing in Pacifica
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.560]   and I always imagine Jim Louderback
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.160]   sitting up on his deck watching me.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.400]   - Yeah, he is.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.160]   - Yeah, as woolly again, surfing.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:06.000]   - You have him up here?
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:06.840]   Everyone's sorry?
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:07.680]   - I haven't had Jim in a long time.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.600]   He left revision three and I think he took some time off,
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.040]   but I get the feeling that he is resurfacing
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:15.960]   to do something new.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.600]   - I sense that, that's why Jim was here.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.440]   - Do you get that sense too?
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:19.280]   - I do, get him up here, I'm curious.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.120]   - He's up to something.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:20.960]   - I know.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:21.800]   - That louder back.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:22.640]   - Shout ahead, he's doing something.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.040]   - Shout ahead, we call him.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.240]   He said, "You can call me Jim Lopsdubak."
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.680]   That's what they did at school.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:28.520]   - Back in Vermont.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.000]   - Vermont, Lopsdubak.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   You seem like you'd wear a runner's watch,
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.760]   like a GPS watch with the helmet.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.600]   - I've been testing sleep devices lately,
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.120]   so I've had the basis, I've had the jawbone up 24,
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.640]   and then I've using these other ones,
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.240]   I test out the sleep number bed
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.000]   that keeps track of your sleep completely through the mattress.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:48.840]   That's bizarre.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:49.680]   - Really?
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.520]   - The mattress, the mattress, the monitor's.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.680]   - The mattress, it knows your temperature,
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.920]   your respiration rate, when you're in deep light
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.280]   or REM sleep, how long do you have?
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.000]   - I like that information useful in any way.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.120]   - Oh, I love sleep.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120]   - Well, I like looking at the information,
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.080]   but what do you do with it?
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.440]   - Well, I'm trying to get more deep sleep,
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.280]   because what I noticed--
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.160]   - But how do you get that?
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.960]   - Well, there's lots of little ways to hack it,
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.120]   so you can work out later in the day.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:10.960]   - Oh, okay.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.800]   - You can--
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.000]   - So you're marrying it with behavioral information
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.640]   from the day to see what helps you sleep better.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.720]   - Exactly.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.960]   - And trying to figure out,
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.120]   well, what makes me feel better?
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.640]   What makes me, you know how when you,
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.160]   do you ever have this thing where you go to the gym
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.200]   and you're like, "I'm gonna go run for do whatever."
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.600]   And you get there and it's just like,
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.560]   "Mwah, mwah, mwah."
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.960]   And you just can't do it.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.840]   A lot of that is because of how you slept.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.240]   - And then my watch shocked me.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.840]   - Yes, see, and then you got on it.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:36.760]   - Yeah, and then I got on it.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.040]   - See, but if you hack your sleep and--
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.280]   - That's what Jessica Corbin's all about.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.680]   She makes a device, she should probably get that too.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.080]   She makes a device that measures your recovery rate,
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.560]   your heart rate recovery index.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.480]   You look into that, it's a fascinating thing.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.600]   It's another health watch.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.720]   - That's the ultimate arbiter of your fitness
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.200]   is how fast you recover.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.040]   - Yeah.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.800]   - You go from high respiration rate to low respiration rate.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.520]   Some of the wearables nowadays are crazy.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.440]   They have these shirts that measure
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.000]   how much exertion as you lift.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.400]   Because if you think about it,
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.840]   a number of OI lifted 20 pounds or 120 pounds,
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.720]   that's a number that's meaningless
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.600]   unless it's relative to your weight, gender, strength,
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.440]   bap, bap, bap.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.520]   But exertion, the shirt measures this
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.480]   and I don't know whether they do it in force
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.680]   or perceived calories.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.520]   - That's wild.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.360]   - But I mean, some of these wearables
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.400]   are insane that they're coming out.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.320]   The one that I'm waiting for that still doesn't exist,
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.600]   a device that measures your actual caloric intake.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.560]   - That I want, 'cause you know, all these watches say,
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.800]   well, but you have to enter it all in.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.000]   I want something that looks at my mouth
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.160]   and says, "Good God, Leah."
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.120]   - They have apps that use the camera, right?
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:49.720]   - And there's that cup that's supposedly--
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.760]   - Yeah, and the fork.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:51.600]   - There's a--
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.960]   - The happy fork. - Yeah, the happy fork.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.360]   Well, there was a company in Toronto
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.600]   that said they were making a watch that measured--
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.240]   - How could it watch your food go?
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.080]   - This is what it did.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.520]   It was measuring the fat, soluble fat,
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.000]   and sugar in your blood,
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.040]   through your wrist pulse, was that your distal or whatever.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:08.920]   - Wow. - And then,
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.120]   but that turned out to be vaporware shock of all stocks.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:12.960]   - Yeah.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.320]   - There was like a tricorder.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.200]   - Something like that. - Yeah.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.400]   Well, look at this, this is fitness.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.760]   This is Jessica's business, fitness RX.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.800]   It's a fitness band and it measures your recovery, right?
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.200]   And it apparently tells you, like today,
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.600]   you're gonna be want, want.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.440]   - Yeah.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.760]   - Or today, you're gonna be great.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:29.600]   - Huh.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.440]   - Well, we can say, "vitness."
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.280]   All right, I'm gonna go to--
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.480]   - Fitness RX, yeah.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.480]   - Cool.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.440]   - Our show today brought to you
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.200]   not by any of those fine products,
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:39.200]   but by carbonite online backup,
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.040]   when it comes to data protection,
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.880]   carbonite means "bitness."
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.320]   I use carbonite everywhere to protect my data.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.600]   In the cloud, we're talking on the radio show,
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.760]   carbonite's network center, their data center,
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.040]   where your data is stored.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.840]   It's encrypted, by the way, on the way there,
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.160]   and it's encrypted there.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.640]   It is in a temperature control 24-hour guarded facility.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.240]   It is backed up at all times.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.520]   It is, your data is happier than you are.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.200]   Your data is living the life up there
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.480]   in the carbonite cloud, but that's nice
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.680]   because should anything happen,
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.200]   you can get your data back.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.200]   It may not be so happy about coming back to your computer,
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.760]   but it will, and that's the beauty
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.280]   of 50,000 small businesses now use carbonite
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.520]   at their business.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.000]   Many home users, I think it's over a million home users.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.760]   With carbonite, everything's backed up.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.560]   Your computers, your servers, your external hard drives,
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.480]   just pick the carbonite plan that is right for you.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.760]   They have business plans and personal plans.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.160]   The personal plan starts at $59.99 a year
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.220]   for everything on a Mac or a PC.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:46.680]   If you go to carbonite.com,
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:49.400]   you can try it free right now, no credit card needed,
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.600]   but do use the offer code TWIT when you sign up.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.240]   That way you'll get two free bonus months
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.480]   when you decide to buy.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.400]   The nice thing about carbonite,
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.920]   once you've installed it, you don't have to think about it.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.000]   It's always backing up continually,
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.280]   whenever you're online.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.560]   It's just a great solution.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.240]   Carbonite.com, you gotta back up to get it back.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.200]   Do it right.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.600]   Carbonite.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.280]   I figure everybody watching this show
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.120]   probably knows that, right?
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.080]   But I also figure a lot of people watching this show
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.440]   don't actually back up.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.560]   So do it and tell your family and friends.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:22.760]   Now the holidays are here.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.200]   Your family and friends have come to bug you.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.160]   Give them something of worth as they leave.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.320]   Say, here's carbonite.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.840]   My aunt in Hawaii listens to your radio show
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:31.920]   and she called me and she said,
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.840]   "I gotta back up."
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.400]   And Leo says, "Use carbonite."
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.480]   I'm gonna do it, right?
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.760]   I said, "Yeah, you're gonna do it."
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.760]   Good for her.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.600]   That's awesome.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.520]   Awesome.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.160]   Let's see, Carly Fiorina.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.880]   Now, by the way,
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.080]   the pre-texting thing was while Carly was seeking.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:48.920]   You're right.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.720]   Mark Hurd was the sexual harassment issue.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.560]   Well, HP had a bad right.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.400]   Let's get that right.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.240]   That run a lot there.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.280]   Well, and then there was Leo Apotheker
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:58.240]   who said, "Let's split the whole business up."
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.080]   Nevermind.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:29:59.840]   And now it's Meg Whitman
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.680]   and they're gonna split the whole business up.
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.600]   So it's very confusing over the eight years.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.400]   You think Yahoo's crazy?
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.400]   The HP.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.240]   But you know what?
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.400]   HP has a big hit.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.880]   The stream.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.200]   Have you been talking about the stream anyway?
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:17.040]   This is like a Chromebook price, Windows laptop.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:17.880]   $200?
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.720]   $200.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:19.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.920]   It looks kind of junky for you and me,
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.000]   but again, it's not for you and me.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.240]   Hey, you're using an 11-inch MacBook.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.240]   Right?
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.080]   They have 11.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.720]   They have larger ones too.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.200]   It's kind of cool looking.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.440]   I think they've sold out actually during Black Friday.
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.280]   I was just gonna look.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.600]   I saw a lot of deals for them on Black Friday.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.960]   They were very aggressive.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.240]   You know, HP has gone through some tough times,
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.960]   but a lot of people,
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.080]   they have an 11, a 13, and a 14-inch stream.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:53.280]   And even the 14-inch is I think only $300.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   You got $2.99.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:57.840]   This is smart because Black Friday basically conditions
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.840]   consumers over time to purchase certain things
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:01.760]   at certain times.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:04.080]   And one of the things that we've been told over and over
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.560]   is that laptop deals on Black Friday are significant.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:10.400]   So if you can put a sub-200 laptop on the table,
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:15.400]   the spec, it's not that consumers aren't intelligent
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.840]   and doing their research,
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.360]   but specs are not as important as price to certain--
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.200]   That's the bottom line for a lot of buyers.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.720]   It's like, can I get on the internet?
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.120]   Can I use office?
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.360]   Good, I'm in.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.040]   Probably not something you or I would use,
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.360]   but I think this is HP's response to the Chromebook.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.360]   Oh yeah, it would never exist without the Chromebook.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:39.200]   And Carly Fiorina, former HP executive,
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:42.640]   remember she ran for governor in California.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.760]   She spent a lot of money.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.360]   Spent a lot of money, didn't even come close.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.440]   So ran for the, was it the--
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.800]   Meg Whitman ran for one thing.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800]   Big Whitman ran for--
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.760]   Oh, what a Carly ran for the Senate.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.080]   Senate, all right.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.480]   Again, we--
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:56.320]   Go here.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.160]   Go here.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.000]   And Markford did not run for anything.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:58.840]   And Markford did not run for anything.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.600]   So you're CEO's, again.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:01.600]   No you're CEO's.
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.600]   So Meg Whitman, that's right.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:05.200]   She ran for governor and lost.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:08.120]   And then got HP as her consolation prize.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.240]   Early ran for Senate in 2010.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.960]   Yeah, I guess Diane Feinstein.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.880]   I can't remember.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:15.720]   Barbara Boxer.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.560]   Barbara Boxer.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.400]   I guess Boxer.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.880]   You know, I think I am too old now for this.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.680]   Would you take over?
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:20.520]   Yeah, I'm here for this.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.360]   I'm going home.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.520]   I'm going to the home.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.040]   Well, okay, so this is the thing, right?
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.120]   We were talking about podcasts.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.720]   And I think about it as a,
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.720]   I'm getting my, my, my paycheck comes from ABC.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.560]   Right.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:34.960]   And I think about all the money that is going into TV ads,
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.040]   political TV ads.
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.360]   So podcasting, if it ever starts to go down,
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.080]   you just got to take political ads, Leo.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.200]   It keeps radio alive single handedly.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.040]   I know.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.280]   Keeps radio alive because they are,
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:49.720]   the radio is required to offer ads
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:52.880]   to political candidates and parties and propositions.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.800]   And it's California, there's so much stuff.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.200]   But I think that they can charge the full rack rate.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.280]   Wow.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.600]   So they're required to sell these ads,
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.160]   but they don't have to give you this account.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.960]   So the radio loves political ads.
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:04.800]   Maybe.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.200]   I can't bite the hand that feeds me.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.040]   I don't like it, but.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:10.600]   We had the candidate for a lieutenant governor
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.960]   for the great state of California
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:15.120]   came into our audience in San Diego during an entire twit.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.560]   And I knew he wasn't a normal person
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.640]   'cause he was wearing a suit.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.720]   Was this Keshkari?
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.600]   Ron Nering.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.440]   Oh, sorry.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.800]   You were the GOP candidate.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.640]   All right.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.400]   Did I just think Keshkari was the G.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.240]   No one did that away.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.080]   Governor.
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.960]   But nice guy.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.160]   He came in, he wanted to meet with me.
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.120]   I think he was very confused about the power
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.280]   of the twit army.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.520]   (laughing)
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.320]   Do you have a plan to invade with your own?
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.840]   And then the GOP candidate
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.600]   means that the entire slate of GOP candidates
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.920]   would like to be on twit next Sunday.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.000]   Huh.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.080]   Whoa.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.640]   And I thought, yeah, I don't think so.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:51.800]   I said, well, if you want, we'll talk before the show
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.320]   and then they said, oh, no, we got a dinner.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.160]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.920]   So nevermind.
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.120]   Super interested until we're not.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.000]   Flickr is annoying photographers.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.640]   Now, when you put a picture up on Flickr,
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.080]   you can decide on the license.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.920]   You can assign it a Creative Commons license, if you wish.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:10.320]   And in many cases, people assign a very
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.360]   lenient Creative Commons license
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:15.280]   that allows people to use your photos.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.280]   I think that's a nice thing to do.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.240]   But according to some, Flickr is about
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.400]   to sell your prints and not give you a penny
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:26.080]   because you said you would.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.280]   Flickr is gonna make nice prints
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.520]   of some of its best images.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:38.160]   For $49 a pop.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.280]   But the only credit and the only money you'll get small sticker
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.920]   at the bottom of the print with your name.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:46.080]   Now, you can, and it's not too late.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.120]   You can go to Flickr and change the license
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.040]   in all of your images.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:51.440]   And you might want to do that.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.560]   I licensed Creative Commons on Flickr, but non-commercial.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.720]   And that would stop them from selling my pictures.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.680]   $50 million of the finest--
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:05.960]   $50 million of the finest photos on Flickr, now on your wall.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.440]   Huh.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.320]   Yeah, but in many cases, images that the photographer
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.040]   doesn't even know they're for sale.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.960]   But because they used a Creative Commons license.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.280]   You'd think they'd want to use to enable
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.320]   the people who use their service to sell their prints.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.760]   Make a little money.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.240]   Rather than just sell them.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.240]   Yeah, they're nice prints.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.200]   It's too bad too because it's somebody who will use
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:31.240]   the Creative Commons license photos on my own website.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.240]   Right.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.360]   And credit, what this is going to do,
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.800]   it's going to pull a lot of photos off
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:38.200]   of Creative Commons on Flickr and make the whole service
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.680]   poor for it.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.240]   I think a lot of these photographers know
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.680]   that you're probably going to use this
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.240]   as stock photos on the web and don't lie.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:49.240]   But they might think that a big company like Flickr
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.080]   owned by Yahoo, sorry.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.480]   I'm not targeting Yahoo.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.440]   I just want you to know.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.200]   Would might not do something like this.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.840]   Well, it seems like the negative press wouldn't be worth it.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.840]   But then on the other hand, nothing free is free.
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:03.840]   I've got it.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.320]   But I feel like we've done this.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.320]   Haven't we done this?
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:12.400]   5,000 different ways to Sunday, Facebook, Instagram.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.400]   You know?
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.840]   No, I presume that if you change the license,
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.760]   it would just automatically pull it off this.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:18.760]   But I don't know.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.080]   I mean, these are people who, as far as I know,
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.680]   intentionally said, yes, you can use this thing I
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.120]   took for commercial purposes.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.120]   Right.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.120]   Make money off it.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.120]   I think the fact that that's Flickr doing it
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.800]   probably gives people a different attitude,
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.280]   because they didn't expect that to happen.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:33.800]   Right.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:36.200]   And Flickr probably could get around by this and avoid an
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.080]   unforced error just by throwing all the money people's
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:39.600]   away.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.200]   That's a great term, an unforced error.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.240]   But morally, I think what Flickr is doing is just fine.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.760]   People said you didn't do this.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.760]   It's legal?
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.920]   It's legal and a technical.
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.120]   It's perfectly OK, except that it's just a--
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.080]   The optics might be bad.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.000]   The optics are not good.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.760]   I wouldn't expect the sports metaphor from Harry.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.600]   You just pulled that one out with the total ease.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.800]   More and more, the world seems to be full of unforced errors.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.800]   Like all the stuff we would get.
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:02.640]   It's a good term, isn't it?
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.320]   Uber did all this stuff, which they could easily not have
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.240]   done, but they did it anyway.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:06.760]   Right.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.120]   All right, is this an unforced error?
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:13.200]   The music industry is finally suing an ISP over piracy.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.120]   BMG and Round Hill Music are suing Cox Communications,
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:20.800]   saying that Cox has not done enough to punish those who
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.160]   download music illegally.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.440]   This is what the ISPs wanted to avoid when they agreed to
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.880]   the industry's six strikes rules.
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:30.360]   They didn't really want to get in this battle.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.680]   God, law moves slow.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.480]   This is like seven years ago, eight years ago.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.400]   They're using Napster.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.200]   They're really complaining about BitTorrent.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.920]   In their complaint, the music publishers
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.040]   described the Cox network as an out-of-control den
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.080]   of piracy, quote, "Today, BitTorrent systems
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.280]   are like the old P2P systems on steroids."
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.840]   It's like Napster on steroids.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.080]   Even their terminology is so 80s.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.080]   It's like the Boston Strangler on steroids.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.400]   On steroids.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.800]   Yeah, even that's old.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.040]   They're using performance enhancing drugs
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.080]   on the old P2P systems.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.680]   They are roided out.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:15.160]   Despite its published policy to the contrary,
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.720]   Cox's actual policy, this is again from the complaint,
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.360]   is to refuse to suspend, terminate,
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.400]   or otherwise penalize subscriber accounts that repeatedly
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.960]   commit copyright infringement through its network
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:28.920]   in any meaningful numbers.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:32.760]   In other words, Cox is not firing customers
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.880]   when it gets a complaint from the music publishers.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.080]   Now, the six strikes rule, and I think Cox
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:40.960]   was a signatory to this, gave you six strikes.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.120]   The music publisher would write a letter saying,
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.960]   IP address 192.1968 is using BitTorrent,
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:50.160]   and Cox would send you a letter, hey, knock it off.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:53.560]   You get six times, the punishment gets worse each time
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:57.240]   up to the point of possibly being banned from the service.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.840]   Cox, here's what Cox alleged.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.840]   A Cox subscriber account with IP address 70.168.128.98
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.840]   at the time of the infringement believed to be located
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.400]   in Fairfax, Virginia, was used to infringe 24
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:18.400]   particular copyrighted works 1,586 times.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.080]   So that seems like an appropriate time for throttling.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.400]   It's a little case by case, punitive throttling,
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.480]   especially if it's Taylor Swift songs.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.720]   So I'm just saying, yeah, I get it.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.640]   - I guess Cox has declined to comment.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.120]   This is an ours technique of story.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.080]   Cox was contacted but did not comment,
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.520]   but presumably will fight it in court.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:49.600]   I think the record, the ISPs don't wanna be doing
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.720]   the bidding of the record companies in this regard, right?
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.600]   But they'd like, they wanna skate around
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.800]   in any kind of lawsuit.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.120]   This is the first time the record companies have actually
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.720]   said, you know what, we're going for it.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.700]   In the past, there's been this kind of truce.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:07.840]   - Well, they had to do, it's like parenting, right?
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.280]   You gotta drop the hammer at least once.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.960]   - At some point, you have to sue.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.920]   - Or else it's just all empty threats.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:13.920]   - Yeah.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.560]   - You gotta put them in timeout.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:18.560]   - They also said that Cox, we've been sending
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.640]   these copyright infringement notices to Cox.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.800]   Cox actually has taken measures to avoid
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:26.720]   and stop receiving those notifications,
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.520]   suggesting they were basically treating them like spam.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.320]   Oh, it's another email from BMG.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.680]   I just throw it in the trash.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:38.560]   Well, we'll watch this one again with interest.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.200]   This does feel like, we haven't had a lawsuit,
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.200]   a record company lawsuit in ages, have we?
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:46.800]   They realized it was a really bad idea to sue end users.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:50.640]   Nobody's gonna complain about suing Cox.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.280]   - And then that makes Cox the police
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.080]   and they have to be the bad guy who forces
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:55.940]   all of these. - Exactly what
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:56.940]   the record industry would like.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:57.780]   - Yeah.
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:59.600]   And I should point out that it's very deceptive
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.360]   to say what they see, what it was at, 1,590.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.520]   It sounds like, you know, they have been giving,
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.120]   you know, basically selling these copyrighted works
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.720]   to thousands of people.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.840]   I'm sure the way BitTorrent works is you get bits
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.240]   and pieces from a lot of people.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.640]   I'm sure all that means is there were 1,586
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.680]   connected to our connections. - Connection.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.120]   - And they, you know, whoever this was,
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.000]   knowingly or unknowingly, I think a lot of people
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.080]   in style, BitTorrent client don't realize
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.280]   that it is then serving out that content.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:33.120]   They had, there's those 24, whatever,
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.560]   songs in their BitTorrent folder
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.720]   and 1,586 connections.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.680]   One subscriber engaged in 39,000 acts
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.880]   of copyright infringement over 189 days, 39,000.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.640]   - That's 1,13 year old girl.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.720]   - Yeah.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.560]   - It's easy.
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.320]   You could do that in a couple of days.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.960]   All right, I'm gonna do one more commercial
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.800]   and then we're going to show you
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.160]   the heartwarming video of the moment
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.840]   that will take all of this bad taste
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:59.880]   about Black Friday out of your mouth.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:00.720]   - I cried.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:01.540]   - And put it on your wrist.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:02.380]   You know what I'm talking about.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:03.220]   - I cried.
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.060]   - I cried.
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:05.280]   - I made the mistake of showing it right before
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.720]   the radio show and I was in tears.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.560]   - Isn't that the worst?
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.960]   At least you weren't wearing eyeliner.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:10.960]   I was just a thing.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:15.900]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.580]   Squarespace 7 is here.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:19.940]   They get, you know, the great thing about Squarespace is,
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:21.580]   you know, it's hosting plus software,
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.300]   but because they do both,

[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:47.580]   You have to have a site that you control you own.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.180]   You know, you could do everything else.
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:51.660]   You could have a Facebook page for your business.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:52.740]   You can have a Twitter account,
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:55.380]   but you gotta have the one place people go.
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:58.500]   Ideally with your domain name on the web
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:00.820]   and Squarespace makes that very easy.
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:02.520]   - Back to youworler.com, Squarespace.

[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.580]   and wire it all up for you.

[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:27.740]   You pick the template, easy to switch, by the way.
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:29.140]   You don't have to worry about the content.
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:30.380]   It's all protected.

[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:32.980]   if you feel like it.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:35.180]   And now when you wanna modify the template,
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.700]   what you do wanna do, you wanna customize it
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.580]   to make it yours, you can do that
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:42.060]   in live edit, wizzy wig editing right on the screen.
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:43.740]   You don't have to go back and forth in a preview mode.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:45.100]   You're just looking at your site and you go,
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:46.860]   "I'll nudge that over that way."
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:47.700]   Put that down there.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:48.820]   Let's add a Twitter feed.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.860]   They have instant access to professional stock
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:53.380]   photography from Getty.

[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.020]   they have a template for bands
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:11.180]   that include tour dates, merch sales, all of that stuff.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:16.180]   Every template has built into it e-commerce,
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:18.660]   even the most inexpensive.
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:20.140]   They've got a great developer platform.
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:23.620]   If you are a wizard on the web, you can really go crazy.

[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.740]   (sighs)
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:13.620]   So there are some very cynical people on the web.
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:14.620]   - Nope.
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:15.940]   - I don't know. - Yes there are.
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.500]   Who swear that this is a fake.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:18.780]   I would submit there's no way
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:20.100]   this could possibly be a fake.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:23.060]   I have a very good nose for fakes.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:25.380]   And gosh knows, there are a lot of fakes on the web.
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:27.580]   - Everyone's a dog on the web?
[01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:28.580]   - Everybody's a dog.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.660]   No one knows you're a dog.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:34.660]   This is a guy, a kid, 10 year old kid named Santiago
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:36.100]   from Argentina.
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:39.740]   Mom and Dad were struggling a little bit
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.500]   and he said, "I want a tablet, I want a tablet."
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.500]   And Mom and Dad thought it'd be kind of funny
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.620]   to punk him just a little bit.
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:48.660]   They wrapped up,
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.220]   it looks like a tablet.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.860]   - Yeah, it really looks like that.
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:53.740]   - He's pretty excited.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.580]   Santiago's very excited.
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:56.420]   - He's got jammy on.
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:57.260]   - He's a little bit muted.
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:58.100]   - Oh, do I have it muted?
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.100]   Let me turn on the sound.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:01.660]   You can, it's in Spanish.
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:02.660]   - Yeah.
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:05.620]   - And oh, it's not a tablet Santiago.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:08.580]   It's a wooden cutting board.
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:11.860]   - And the note says so that you can cut food and vegetables.
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:15.660]   - And look at, now this kid is in deep psychic pain
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:16.500]   right now.
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:19.020]   He thought he was gonna tell him he got a piece of wood.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:20.780]   - But probably the least.
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:22.420]   - But you know what, he's hiding it so well.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:24.460]   I wish my kids were this good.
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:26.460]   And look, he even kisses his mama.
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:30.420]   It's reading the note.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:31.260]   - Yeah.
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:32.500]   - Oh.
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:34.180]   He cleans up the wrapper,
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:35.020]   kisses his mama.
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.060]   He understands times are tough.
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:37.900]   - Yeah, no, no.
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:38.740]   - Don't have a lot of money.
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.740]   I really did want a tablet, but okay.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.580]   - Probably the key to it.
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:41.860]   - Now then they find another box.
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.900]   Looks like, I don't know, it looks like a shoe box.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.500]   - I think he's new soccer fleet.
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:46.340]   - So he's happy.
[01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:47.180]   He's a soccer player.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:48.020]   - Yeah.
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:48.860]   - Of course he is.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:50.260]   Everybody in Argentina plays the beautiful game.
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:51.380]   - You gotta do it, beautiful game.
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.220]   - Gotta do it.
[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:53.300]   - What was the, what was the,
[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:55.380]   the one goal with the hand, Maradona?
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.540]   - Beautiful, Maradona.
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:57.380]   - Hand of God.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:58.940]   - Hand of God, nobody better.
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:46:59.780]   - Cheating.
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:00.620]   - I'm sure he's a fan.
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:02.700]   - Hand of God, it wasn't my hand.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:03.540]   - Yeah.
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:04.700]   - Hand of God, cheating.
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:05.700]   - But no.
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:06.940]   - And so he's open this up.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:07.780]   He's a sweet kid.
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:08.620]   I like this.
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:09.700]   - It's gonna be another cutting board, isn't it?
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:10.540]   - It is.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.620]   - It's gonna be a knife to go with the cutting board,
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.140]   which is really kind of a beautiful thing.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.540]   No, I mean, I, I'll let shoes, right?
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:15.380]   That's running shoes.
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:16.220]   - Yeah, Fila.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.340]   - Fila.
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:18.180]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:19.020]   - Whoa.
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:20.020]   - Boy, that was a look.
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:20.860]   - It's, it's.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:22.140]   - No, it can't be.
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:22.980]   No.
[01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:23.820]   - He's frozen.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:24.660]   - Oh my God, our teary.
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:25.660]   - Don't you get teary?
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:28.780]   - Yeah. 'Cause he thought he got a, frankly, got a piece
[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:30.340]   of wood and some shoes.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.380]   - Oh, he think he knows what it is.
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:33.900]   Another big hug.
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:35.140]   - He got a tablet.
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:37.980]   (laughing)
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.500]   - He cr- Now let me tell you something.
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:40.820]   This is not fake.
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:41.660]   First of all.
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:42.500]   - You cannot make, first of all,
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:43.660]   you wouldn't put that nipple in there.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:44.500]   - No, I'm not.
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.340]   - You couldn't have one right now.
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:47.100]   - That did disturb me.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:48.500]   But secondly, you cannot make a camera.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.260]   - You can't make a 10 year old cry like that.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.940]   - No, I mean, you can, but not.
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:52.780]   - Yeah.
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:54.620]   - Mom apparently saved up.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:58.340]   - Is the stories on the YouTube site.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.140]   He is so happy.
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:05.140]   Now this, folks, if you don't appreciate,
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:06.500]   what a great life we are.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.500]   - The kid is here.
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:08.340]   - Yeah.
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:11.820]   - And you've got your phone and your tablet and your laptop.
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:13.860]   This is a kid who really appreciates.
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:16.900]   Oh, he's so excited.
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:19.820]   - I actually, oh, I saw this and, you know,
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:21.500]   I have been covering Black Friday
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:24.260]   and so many people are just, you know,
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:25.100]   cynical about it.
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:25.940]   - Submarism, consumers.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.980]   - I know, but for a lot of people who spend that time
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:29.860]   in line at Black Friday,
[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:32.020]   it's so that they can get a little bit more
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:32.900]   for their family.
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:34.300]   And I know that's maybe--
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:35.180]   - No, that makes sense.
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:38.260]   And I'm not gonna be dismissive anymore.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:40.820]   - Even if that's only 10% of the people, then fine.
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:42.260]   - Because of little Santiago.
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:44.540]   - So long as there's no Smackdown over the Barbie.
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.380]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:46.220]   - Yeah, don't fight.
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:47.060]   - Yeah.
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:48.060]   Santiago's parents were not involved in any--
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:50.340]   - And that $400 4K TV that you bought
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:52.340]   may not be as good as you think it is.
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.740]   - $899 4K.
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:57.580]   - Yeah.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:58.420]   - I know.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.740]   - Actually, that was like an LG.
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:01.140]   I mean, it was a major name brand.
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:01.980]   It wasn't--
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:02.980]   - Was it a new LG or something?
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:03.820]   - Yeah, it was not.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:08.580]   It was no, what are some of the crazy ones in Signia?
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.900]   - Vizio $700 4K TV.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:11.740]   Where was that?
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:13.180]   It's slickdeals.net.
[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:15.260]   I think you, that's Walmart and slickdeals.
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:16.380]   All right.
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:17.420]   - No, I love that video.
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:19.100]   It was, it's a sweet way to end our--
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:20.180]   - I think so.
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:21.020]   - Giving thanks.
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:22.940]   - Speaking of sweet, thank you for bringing some wine.
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:24.540]   It was delicious and thank you for being here.
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:25.700]   We don't see enough of you, Becky,
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.820]   but I'm so glad when you could come.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.660]   It's just, we think the world of you
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:31.460]   and all the best of GMA.
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:32.300]   - Thanks.
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:33.140]   - And at Yahoo Tech?
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:33.980]   - Yeah.
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:35.820]   - Do you file on a regular basis there?
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:36.980]   Can we catch your stuff on a--
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:37.820]   - Hey, I got random.
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:38.660]   - And just whatever you get around it.
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:40.060]   - CES, man, it's happening, you know?
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:41.860]   - Oh, you know, what are you gonna do for CES?
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.220]   - I'm gonna go.
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:45.540]   I'm gonna take a lot of hand sanitizer.
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:49.060]   I'm gonna try to avoid going out with Devorak,
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:50.740]   'cause that's what the only time I've ever gotten
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:51.860]   in trouble at CES.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:52.700]   - What happened?
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:53.780]   - Devorak.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:55.500]   - Remember, the right to forget.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:58.100]   - I luckily, that was pre-internet.
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:59.180]   Let's just put it this way.
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:01.780]   I ended up in some place that I never wanted to buy.
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:02.860]   - He's a wild man, actually.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:04.940]   - Devorak and who's that guy?
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:06.340]   San Simeon guy?
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:07.180]   - Will Hurst?
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.020]   - Yeah.
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:08.860]   - Oh, those two are troubled, either.
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:09.700]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.580]   - The ones a billionaire, the other ones glad to spend the money.
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:13.500]   - Oh, yeah, it was bad.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:16.860]   3 AM and I had a live shot on CNN at 4.30,
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:18.500]   and all of a sudden I realized,
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.420]   I do not want to be with Devorak and Hurst
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:21.980]   at 3 AM in Vegas
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:23.420]   and I would have to be with a live shot.
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:24.260]   - That's trouble.
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:26.100]   - Ooh, it makes me nervous just thinking about it.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.100]   I'm all sweaty thinking about it.
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:28.700]   - So you're going with ABC,
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:29.980]   so it'll be a big deal, right?
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:31.540]   You'll have-- - Well, I'm going with Yahoo.
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:32.380]   - Or you going with Yahoo?
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:33.460]   - ABC doesn't care about that anymore.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.300]   - They don't care about CES.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.580]   - No, no.
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:37.140]   - Yahoo, take care.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:38.580]   - Well, awesome, we'll watch for your coverage.
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:40.940]   That's, believe it or not, like a month away.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:41.780]   - I know.
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:43.340]   - Six weeks away, holy cow.
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:44.420]   - I know.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:45.860]   - Harry McCracken, you going to CES?
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:48.140]   - This is the first year since 1991
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:50.300]   that I'm not going to CES or come back
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:52.060]   or any other tech show in Vegas.
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.740]   - How about Mobile World Congress?
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.340]   That's the one to go to nowadays.
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:56.740]   - That's probably the one show to go to.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:57.740]   - Yep, yep.
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:00.140]   - Yeah, I'm skipping it for the first time ever.
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:01.620]   - Really, does that make you feel a little,
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:04.660]   a little fomo, a little fear of missing out?
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:07.700]   - I'm torn between feeling like I'm skipping Christmas
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.940]   and feeling like I don't have to file my taxes.
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:10.780]   - Yeah, I really need--
[01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:14.620]   - I'm going to CES is like getting a call from the governor.
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:15.460]   - Yeah.
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.300]   - Okay, it's like you're free.
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:20.180]   - Up until now, I've always said that I like going to see
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:22.140]   CES in some ways I do, so we'll see.
[01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:22.980]   - What are you saying?
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:24.580]   CES is like Christmas with a root canal.
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:25.420]   - Yes.
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:26.260]   - Like the two together.
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:27.260]   - It's both fun and painful.
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:28.100]   - It is.
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:29.180]   That's actually probably the most aptest--
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:30.900]   - The way to do it would be to go there.
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:33.500]   In the old old days when I worked for a print magazine,
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:34.380]   trade shows were fun,
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:35.940]   'cause when you went to a trade show,
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:38.380]   you stopped all your normal work while you were there.
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:39.740]   And the moment they invented the internet
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:42.060]   and you had to file stories every day,
[01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:43.860]   trade shows stopped being as much fun.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:46.380]   - I knew they shouldn't have invented the internet.
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:47.540]   - I know, ruined everything.
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:48.380]   - It ruined everything.
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:49.220]   - Were you there with me?
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:51.140]   - And Hirst and Devorah?
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:51.980]   (laughing)
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:52.820]   - No.
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:54.660]   - He doesn't remember and he's gonna keep it that way.
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:56.140]   (laughing)
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:57.460]   No CES for Jason Snow.
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:00.100]   - I know, that's actually one of the top things
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:02.580]   about no longer being employed by my former employers.
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:05.100]   They're not gonna make me go to CES like they did last year.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.500]   - But you will be covering it as we will be remotely.
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:10.580]   We actually are sending Father Roberts going,
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:13.860]   Dicty Bartolos going, live a live camera,
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.140]   so we will actually have live streaming from CES.
[01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:17.420]   We're going back to the old way.
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:19.580]   Remember for a while we had a booth
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:21.420]   and we were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:23.300]   and I'm like, "Well, what are we doing here?
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.140]   "What are we doing here?"
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:26.100]   And then Spike takes over the whole garage and it's like--
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:26.940]   - Oh, it's crazy.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:27.780]   - I was crazy.
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:29.540]   - Did the top floor of the Renaissance?
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:30.380]   - Yeah. - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:31.220]   It was nuts.
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.700]   - Crazy. - Yeah.
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:34.700]   - And then they left after day two.
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:36.060]   It was like, you don't care?
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:37.140]   Yeah, we've seen everything.
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:38.140]   - Flash in the pan, or--
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.140]   - Flash in the pan.
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:40.260]   We're here for the long haul.
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:43.540]   So I personally will not be going,
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:46.140]   but I will be anchoring our coverage.
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:46.980]   - From right here.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:48.220]   - You think I'm gonna go?
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:49.220]   - I don't know.
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.220]   - Oh no.
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:53.260]   The governor is called back and he takes it back, Leo.
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:54.860]   - I'll get you the mini hand sanitizer.
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:55.860]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:56.860]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:57.860]   - No, no, no.
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:52:58.860]   - It's the CES for you.
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:00.260]   - Was that worse than the shock?
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.660]   - Ugh, yes.
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:03.340]   That was worse than the watch.
[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:04.660]   - Ugh.
[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:05.500]   - Ugh.
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.500]   - Pokito CES.
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:08.500]   - Pokito CES.
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.500]   - It's like she gave me a piece of wood and then--
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:11.500]   - Yeah.
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:12.500]   - Then the root panel.
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:13.500]   - It was the opposite.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:14.500]   (laughing)
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.500]   - The incomparable is so good.
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:17.620]   I imagine, yes, you did.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:19.300]   You talked about the Star Wars trailer.
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:21.540]   - We did not just talk about the Star Wars trailer.
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:25.140]   We did an hour and 10 minutes about an 80 second long trailer.
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:26.140]   - Wow.
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:27.140]   - Because you knew we would.
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:28.140]   - Frame.
[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:29.700]   - And you and Syracuse, so went deep into it.
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:30.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:31.700]   - Oh yeah.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.540]   - And you have seen, I'm sure, the variations already
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:34.540]   on the Star.
[01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:36.540]   - Oh, there's the George Lucas' special edition of the trailer.
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:37.540]   - Yeah, where's that puppets going through it?
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:38.540]   - Just crap everywhere.
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:39.540]   - You know, jar, jar.
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:41.340]   - And there's the Lego of Star Wars trailer, which is very good.
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:42.340]   - Which is actually quite accurate.
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:44.460]   - Yeah, I know they did a great job with it.
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:47.260]   - This movie's not going to be out for more than a year, but
[01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:48.260]   there is a trailer.
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:49.260]   - Star Wars fans are really excited.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:50.260]   They're reading the tea leaves.
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:52.340]   - Tim Goodman has a podcast with you guys, right?
[01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:53.340]   - Yep.
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:54.340]   - She is awesome.
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:57.100]   - Yeah, Tim Goodman from the Hollywood Reporter and I do a TV podcast called TV Talk Machine.
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:58.100]   It's on the Compromator.
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:01.100]   - He used to be the TV reviewer at the Compromator.
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:02.100]   - The Chroniclier and the Internet.
[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:03.100]   - I read this stuff religiously.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:05.580]   - Yeah, so we're doing a weekly TV podcast.
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:09.500]   - It looks like six colors has really become mostly about your podcast.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.620]   - Well, it's in there.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:11.940]   You gotta cross promote.
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:12.940]   - You gotta do it all.
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:13.940]   - You gotta do it all.
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:14.940]   - You gotta cross promote.
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:15.940]   - You gotta do that.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:16.940]   You gotta have a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:17.940]   - Little comics?
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:18.940]   - No, we got a lot of that.
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:19.940]   - A little technology.
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:21.100]   - That was my gift guide, Marvel Unlimited is a really great service.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:22.700]   And then, yeah, there's tech.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:24.540]   There's lots of good stuff on six colors.
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:26.340]   - And then there's Siri.
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:27.340]   - There's Siri.
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:28.340]   - Yes.
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.340]   - Siri.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:30.340]   - Siri, maybe Siri could do something.
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:31.340]   Look at that.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:32.340]   - Is there something you want?
[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:34.980]   - I wondered about that screenshot, perhaps not having enough content.
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:35.980]   I wanted to watch television.
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:36.980]   - Did I do something wrong?
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:37.980]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:38.980]   I had zoomed in.
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:39.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:40.980]   There we go.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:41.980]   Much better.
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:42.980]   Much better.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:43.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:44.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:45.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:46.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:47.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:48.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:49.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:50.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:51.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:52.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:53.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:54.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:55.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:56.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:57.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:54:58.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:54:59.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:00.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:01.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:02.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:03.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:04.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:05.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:06.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:07.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:08.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:09.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:10.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:11.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:12.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:13.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:14.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:15.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:16.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:17.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:18.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:19.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:20.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:21.980]   - I'm sorry.
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:22.980]   - I'm sorry.
