[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:22.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 55 for May 21st, 2006.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:43.800]   We are gathered here, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss the weeks, news, in technology,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.200]   and once again, another fantastic Twit panels.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.400]   Steve Gibson hasn't been with us in so long, I thought I'd bring along, especially since
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.400]   some security things to talk about.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.400]   Hey Leo, nice to be here.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.400]   Welcome back.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.120]   Our good friend Robert Herron is here because he had promised to give us a review of some
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.400]   high-def DVD players and we thought we'd get him on to talk about that.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   Hey, pleasure.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   Welcome back Robert from DLTV.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.240]   And from Great Britain, although he can't seem to make up his mind whether he's from
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.600]   England, the UK or Great Britain, all three actually.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   Will Harris.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.000]   Hey, how's it going, Leo?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Good to have you from bit-tech.net.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.520]   And of course, the linchpin of the Twit scene, Mr. John C. Devorak.org/blog.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   I'm just going to, every time I say Devorak, I'll just say.org/blog.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.080]   Actually, I'm going to try to have my name legally changed.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.520]   Your honor?
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.960]   Not to Jesus Christ, but to Devorak.org/blog.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.960]   Exactly.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.720]   That's a great idea.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.880]   Maybe I could be Leo Twit.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.960]   I don't know if that's a choice.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960]   I already did that one.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.720]   I already am that.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.960]   I'm living that.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.280]   Did you see anybody, nobody flew to New York to see the new Apple Store.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.240]   But boy, that looks gorgeous.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.240]   Fifth Avenue.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.240]   And it's all underground.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.120]   I mentioned that to somebody that said, "Oh yeah, Manhattan real estate is so expensive.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   They're moving underground."
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.800]   But that's not why they did it because there's this giant glass cube up top occupying space.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   And it is spectacular.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   Anybody see the video?
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   They are so cool.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   Apple is so cool.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.200]   John, have you seen the pictures of this Apple Store?
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   I blogged it.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   Did you?
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   Yeah, I got a picture of John Brockman's offices right next door.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   So he sent out a photo.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   Oh, no.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.480]   A couple of days I blogged it a day ahead on Thursday before they opened it.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   You know, I made some interesting comments.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.680]   You know, this thing's going to be open 24/7.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.160]   It looks like a big giant public restroom.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.760]   Essentially, and I expect people going in there, you know, to pee.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.080]   Anywhere's the bathroom, man?
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.160]   Why would you have a 24/7 store?
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.680]   Do people really want to buy Macintosh computers or iPods at 4 in the morning?
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   New York, though.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680]   The city didn't ever sleep.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   So sleep.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.080]   Well, surely it's for students who suddenly get like, you know, halfway through an all
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.440]   night different essay and then MacBook dies or something and go, "Oh, I've got to get
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.400]   a new MacBook for my essays in tomorrow."
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.680]   And you can run down the Apple Store at like 5 in the morning.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.720]   I've got a few shows in my credit card.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   Let's buy a new computer.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.320]   All right, I have a major confession to make.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.120]   I didn't go to New York to buy it, but the minute I guess it was Monday morning or was
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   it Tuesday?
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.200]   It was Tuesday morning without a fanfare, without a, you know, no Steve Jobs speech, no mystery
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.640]   invitation to the press.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.040]   Apple just kind of put it up on their website, the new MacBook.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.720]   And I admit, not only did I buy one, but I paid the $150 premium to get it in black.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.560]   And how'd you like it?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.960]   Am I a sucker?
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:48.080]   No, Leo, you're the most unbelievable example of it, like beyond early adopter.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.920]   Anything that happens, I mean, we can go on with some of these things we've done like
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.280]   Vintrilio and some of these other things.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.240]   It's amazing that you jump on anything.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.520]   I have no impulse control.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.640]   Actually Alex Lindsey is worse.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.680]   Alex Lindsey told me that he, with the last Apple announcement, he actually called the
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.920]   Apple Store and said, "I don't know what it is, but whatever it is, hold it."
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.440]   For me, I'll be in to get it.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   I want one.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   I want one.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.560]   I don't know what it is, but I want one.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.400]   And you know, I can tell them what it is.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.440]   Well, in this case, we knew it was too much disposable income.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440]   That's what it is.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   Do you think so?
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   So tell us about the Soto?
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.440]   I haven't got it yet.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.360]   No, it's a, you know, I ordered it a BTO because that is built to order.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.680]   I didn't go to the Mac Apple Store.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.960]   I actually ordered it online because I want, first of all, I wanted a gig of memory.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.160]   In fact, if it hadn't been an extra 500, I probably would have ordered the two gigs
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   or...
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160]   Wow.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.520]   They tried you an extra 500 just for going from one to two gigs.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520]   That's outrageous.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.160]   It's only 100 to go to five from 512 to one, which is still overpriced, but that's ridiculous
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   to charge your 500.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.200]   Well, I went to see it in the Apple Store in London, actually.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.880]   They had a bunch of them out.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.880]   And?
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.120]   Well, I mean, the machine itself, the form factor is really, really nice.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.280]   The 13-inch white screen works really well.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.040]   That's what I was waiting for is the screen size.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.440]   So that's great.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   The glossy screen is nice.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.120]   If you like glossy screens, the major problem with the premium on the black one is that
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.040]   the black is...
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.080]   It doesn't have that kind of polycarbonate coating.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.800]   You know the white one is kind of shiny.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.720]   It's all really tough plastic.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.440]   The black one is just like a really matte black paint job.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.600]   And the guys in the Apple Store were like, "Oh, this is never going to survive."
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.000]   They were saying the actual guys that worked there were saying they were really worried
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.320]   that it was going to scratch like crazy because there's no protective coating over the top.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.120]   It just kind of feels like a powder coating kind of thing.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   I was wondering myself.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.120]   In fact, there was...
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.120]   You could have painted it yourself.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.120]   I know.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.400]   For 150 bucks, I could have probably painted it blue.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   I know.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.640]   I feel like a such a sucker.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:53.040]   But you know, and the irony is IBM HP, every laptop's black.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.600]   Why am I paying a premium to get an Apple that looks like every other laptop?
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.000]   Well, that would be an Apple in black for a while, is there?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   No.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And a white laptop.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Three or something.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   A white laptop's too girly for me.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I didn't want a white laptop.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.600]   I think black is cool.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.800]   I wonder if they've made it matte after their experience with the black iPod where people
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   were complaining they were just scratching so easily.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.000]   I think that's exactly what it was.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.560]   Yeah, and matte is so much easier when it gets scratched up that makes it even look worse.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.360]   You can't buff it out.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.800]   Yeah, and it's quite fingerprinty as well.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.480]   It's just nice to see hardware devotion for a particular, you know, a complete PC.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.640]   You have to make people building their own systems and it's just nice to see.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   G-Black.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   That's a sucker.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.240]   I know I'm a sucker and I still can't resist it.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.320]   What's what got a 16 by 9 form factor screen?
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.440]   Yeah, 1280 by 800.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   Nice.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.960]   So your DVDs will fit nicely.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   1280 by 800 is the screen?
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   800?
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   It's like 16 by 10.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.840]   Yeah, it's a little bit bigger than 16 by 9.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.000]   What's the problem, John?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.440]   No, no, no, it just seems like a...
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   The old thing...
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.440]   The iBook, the 4 by 3 iBook is 1024 by 768.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   So it's wider.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.440]   1280 instead of 1024.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.440]   A little higher.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   That would be a slightly higher.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   You could at least go at 1280 by 1024 or something.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.920]   Nobody seems to be complaining about the resolution, although I have to say that people
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.560]   do seem to not like the glossy.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.360]   You have experience with the glossy screens, Nick?
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   I mean, Will...
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   Who's Nick?
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   I don't know who Nick is.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   Who's...
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.960]   Will have your experience with glossy screens?
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.480]   Everybody in Britain should be named Nick.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.040]   It would save me some time.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.640]   Well, it's really a matter of personal preference.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.080]   Some people really like the extra kind of contrast and brightness that you get from the glossy
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.880]   screen.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.280]   And they look really good if you're in the dark.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.400]   But the problem is they reflect and light.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.720]   It's really, really badly.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.720]   So they make it...
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.400]   It's really hard to work outside with a glossy screen because the sun gets reflected like
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   crazy.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.640]   So Robert, the PCs come with glossy screens, right?
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.640]   Some?
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.760]   I've been using one for many seats for about two months now and I love it.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.920]   But at the same point, it's not pointed to our nutty windows and there are no lights
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   behind me.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.600]   You have to have control of the room lighting for it to work.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.920]   It really helps.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.360]   But the blacks are liquid black and the colors pop a little bit better.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.000]   And they're one of my favorite displays, but you're totally right.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.640]   I think it outdoors or with any kind of weird lighting.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.760]   You're just going to see yourself or reflections of what's in the room.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   What's the deal?
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.200]   I mean, is it just the way the screen is coated, the surface of the screen, or is it actually
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.080]   a different kind of screen?
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   No, no.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.720]   It's just that top surface coating.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.480]   It helps actually trap when it goes to pure black, when you're trying to make black on
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.600]   an LCD and you have that backlight glow.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.760]   It helps minimize that glow.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   So the blacks look blacker.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:49.520]   They actually measure darker too, but you're trading off that anti-reflective or the diffusion
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.760]   that most LCD screens have.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.200]   So I guess I will be able to control the lighting so it'll be okay.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.800]   Well, we're going to find TV studio.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.720]   We're just trying to brighten us up enough.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   Right.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.960]   Well, and I suppose we'll find out from you in a few weeks here what you actually think
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.960]   about.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   I'll be bitching and moaning.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.600]   The stories are really, you never tell us what you finally paid for this turkey.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.960]   I think it was almost too grand because I put 120 gig hard, part of the reason I wanted
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.920]   to get the bigger hard drive and the more memory is I wanted to either run and I have
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.360]   to decide which boot camp so I can dual boot windows or I think more likely I'm going to
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.200]   run parallels which is the virtualization software that lets you run windows in a window
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.960]   on OS 10.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.200]   But I'm figuring this is my windows and my Mac.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.440]   I'm thinking you should almost go with the lowest memory build you can get in the thing
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   or whatever you're owning.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.800]   And if you can get with just one stick because I imagine that they're one gig options, two
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   512 sticks.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   It is.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.640]   So if you ever wanted to go beyond that you're going to have to start over essentially.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.200]   If I had thought about it, I would have bought the low end.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:58.360]   Well, you want the two gigahertz and so I would have bought the medium range white.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.680]   I would have bought it with the stock drive and the stock ram pulled them because it turns
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.560]   out it's unlike the older iBooks.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.200]   It's very easy to put in more memory.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.880]   You don't have to take the keyboard out.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.320]   It's like a more traditional laptop with as a port.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.880]   You can open up, get out the memory and the hard drive slides out.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.320]   So I would have just done the upgrade myself.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   I was stupid.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.920]   $500 for a giga ram.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920]   Isn't that outrageous?
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   That's out.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   It's DDR2.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   It's standard RAM.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   Okay.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   So at least it's DDR2.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.440]   So that is more cutting edge and say they all DDR1 stuff for no books.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   How much?
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   How much though?
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.400]   If I wanted to go out and buy two gigs of DDR2, how much am I going to?
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   For a hell book?
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   A couple hundred bucks.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   Okay.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.280]   So I'll save 300 bucks.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.720]   I think I'm going to need the two gigs for parallels to run Windows because it's not.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   No, that's not true.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.640]   They've done all kinds of research that shows once you get to a gig it doesn't do you any
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.720]   good to load up more.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.040]   But understand I'm running at the same time as they're running OS10.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.920]   Are you going to run two simultaneously?
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   Simultaneously.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:59.520]   So you need the two gigs because you want to allocate at least 512 to the parallels partition.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   The memory.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.720]   That's a double take as much as you can get.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.680]   Not to mention the fact that it's got motherboard video.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.680]   It's got the 950.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.400]   Orleo, you just sit around all day watching television.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.920]   Oh yeah, that's true.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   So it doesn't really matter.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.920]   It doesn't.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   Who needs all that RAM?
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.720]   It's nice under Linux though.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.760]   Who needs another laptop for that matter?
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   No, that's true.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   I can't really justify this.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.360]   You should get out of the house more.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   Come on.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   I'm busy.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.080]   I got podcasts to do.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080]   I can't.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.400]   Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll go to the new Apple store in Fifth Avenue.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.640]   That'll get me out of the house.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.480]   Now take a camera.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:37.000]   Reminds me a little bit of the Louvre which has that big glass pyramid above ground.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.360]   Yeah, it's everybody says that's very derivative.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.080]   Well, of course, that's what John was saying.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.320]   It's very much like a Louvre.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.240]   It's a fool.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   The Louvre.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.400]   So doesn't anybody find this story about the RIAA suing XM over it's basically a Tivo-like
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   device?
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.760]   Yeah, this is interesting.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.600]   In fact, there's some, remember the Sirius 50?
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   What is it?
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   The SR50?
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   The SR50.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.880]   That allows you to record was held back and it turns out that the RIAA went to Sirius and
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.680]   said you can't release this.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.360]   It was kind of a portable Tivo for Sirius.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   You can't release this unless you hobble it so that it will only record talk and will
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.160]   not record music.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.160]   So Sirius did.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160]   They held it back.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.920]   It was delayed and they finally released it and it only records talk.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.960]   Now the RIAA is going after XM.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.960]   XM?
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   But to their credit is fighting.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   As they should.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   Good.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.480]   Well, and I have a question.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.840]   What about the dish network and what about the other guys, the DirecTV?
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   I know the dish network for a fact has all the serious stuff.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   That's right.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   Can you record it?
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.920]   Online, and if you've got a Tivo device, you can record it.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.760]   I mean, why don't they sue these guys?
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.120]   But you're not recording it directly.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.720]   You're recording the analog, that's the analog hole, right?
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.840]   You're recording the analog version of it.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.440]   No, I don't, I don't think so.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   That's a digital record.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.840]   If you have the satellite recorder, they integrate it in.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.000]   And these guys have been doing it a lot longer than the XM radio.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.320]   So how come they weren't sued?
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.160]   You know, I love it that this Consumer Electronics Association is now on the other side.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.040]   You know, facing off against the RIA.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.960]   No, that's nothing new.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   Well, they've had enough.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.960]   They don't want the RIA.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.280]   No, this has been going on for years.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.920]   Leo, that's been going on for years.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.960]   Gary Shapiro has had nothing good to say about these guys for years.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.880]   He represents the guys who make this equipment.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   He doesn't represent these copyright holders.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   No, I agree.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   No, no, no.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:41.360]   Here's what Vice President of Governmental Affairs for the CEA, Michael Petter-Coney says.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.360]   Here they go again.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.120]   The record industry is returning to the courts in their non-stop efforts to stop new technology,
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.680]   new to existing products, frustrate customers and make illegal long-standing consumer home
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.680]   recording activities.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.640]   I guess you're right, John.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.160]   They're mad about a lot of stuff.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.080]   Their new target is XM Satellite Radio, one of America's top technology success stories
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.320]   of the new millennium.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:08.360]   XM is only offenses providing legal and exciting programming options to millions of Americans.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.400]   What's interesting is that they said that the damages that the record industry was requesting
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:19.800]   was $150,000 per song recorded by a customer, and somebody sat down and worked it out and
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.600]   said the amount that the industry was requesting was more than the GDP of France every year.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.000]   That's actually greater than the turnover of the industry itself.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.640]   Ask for France instead.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.400]   Just take the whole country.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.160]   The lawsuit says the CEA is another ambush in the labels ongoing wars on innovators and
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   consumers.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.520]   It's time to say enough is enough.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:55.840]   What is the grounds that it is violating copyright because you can make a copy a recording?
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:01.640]   It's allowing people to download direct digital versions and then play those digital versions
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.360]   on that player out of order.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.280]   It's like a time shift.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.040]   The RAAA is saying that it's like iTunes, but what the XM guys and the industry guys are
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.760]   saying is that actually it's not like iTunes because you can't transfer it on.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.240]   You can only play it on that device.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.040]   You can't take it off the device?
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   No.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.040]   That's ridiculous then.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.360]   It's only like recording off the radio or something.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.720]   In fact, the home recording act supports that.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.120]   The HOME Recording Act in the state specifically says that if you can't transfer it off, then
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.960]   it's legal.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:42.440]   That was an act that the RAAA worked to gestate and approve back in the day.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.480]   They've made no mention at all of that act.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.920]   There's no mention of it at all in their lawsuit.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.240]   They're just ignoring it.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.800]   My question is, and we have to get a lawyer on, I remember that the Home Audio Recording
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.440]   Act was specifically for analog recordings.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.200]   Did they not exempt digital recordings or did it strikes me that it was for analog?
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.960]   As far as I know, they didn't exempt digital.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.000]   Well, I mean, I think it's something called the AHRAA.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   That's it.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.320]   It says, "No action may be brought under this title, alleging infringement of copyright
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:26.240]   based on the manufacturer's importation, distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.240]   audio-- Oh, it says digital.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.360]   Or analog recording device or analog recording medium, or based on the non-commercial use
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:38.000]   by a consumer, such as a device or medium for making digital music recordings or analog
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   music recordings."
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.360]   So, the judge is going to look at this and throw it out.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.840]   Well, what they're saying is that it's possibly a negotiating tactic to get XM to pony up
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.840]   more money.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.200]   But of course, if XM knows that a judge is going to throw it out based on that, there's
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.000]   a snow negotiating tactic at all, is it right?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.560]   And XM has, I think, been pretty clear that they're not going to go for this.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.880]   Here's what Mitch Bainwall of the ARA says.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.640]   He says, "XM wants to offer listeners what is essentially a free version of iTunes without
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.280]   paying the music companies for the right to sell their songs.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.360]   Don't they pay for the right to put that music on XM?
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   Of course they do.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.040]   And XM is actually one of the greatest pairs of music royalties in the States.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.120]   He says, "It's a great deal for XM because it drives subscriptions, but it's fundamentally
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.000]   unfair to songwriters and labels and threatens to puncture the integrity of the digital music
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.520]   marketplace puncture the integrity of the digital music marketplace right as it's growing."
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.800]   Well, let me play the devil's advocate.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.040]   Don't artists deserve to be compensated if you're going to be able to record their stuff
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.040]   and listen to it later?
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   Or not?
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.680]   I could do right now over the radio.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.040]   It's kind of like that, except it's digital.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.680]   It's better quality than the radio.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.880]   Yeah, that's our goal.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.920]   Well, yeah, but XM already is compensating the artists under the framework that's being
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.320]   laid out by the American legislature.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.480]   And the Apple argument's a little weak because you have no control over the order of the
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.560]   songs as they come into the player.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.720]   You're at the mercy of XM for their schedules and for which, sure, they break it up by genre,
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.840]   but it's up to the end user to record those things.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.680]   So you can't strip these songs out and take them off or put them anywhere else.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.240]   All you can do is listen to them in a different order if you want.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.040]   Or create analog versions with, you know.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.400]   But you could always do that.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   Very manual labor.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.520]   Yeah, you could do that with anything.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.520]   Right.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.960]   That's the so-called analog hole.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   Well lawsuits are...
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.240]   This isn't the only lawsuit in the news.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.160]   Creative labs, I guess we don't call them labs anymore.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.760]   They're just creative.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.760]   Has gotten creative.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.200]   Their marketplace dwindling.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.360]   They can't sell sound cards.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.360]   Nobody needs them.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   They can't sell the sound cards.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   Oh, they sell sound cards.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   Do they still sound?
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.360]   I love them.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.960]   Don't people get sound cards on their motherboard now and aren't they happy with those?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.560]   You think creative has a business with selling sound cards anymore?
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   Oh, sure.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.960]   Yeah, they've got some good stuff.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.760]   They sell some good new gaming cards.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.160]   The X-Fi is pretty cool.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.760]   Oh, come on.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.840]   They probably largely are there because of inertia.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.480]   You certainly wouldn't create a company that didn't exist today in order to sell sound cards.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.440]   But they've established themselves and there are higher N6 channels.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.400]   Because I want to surround.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   No, exactly.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   All right.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.840]   Their sound cards for the PC are better than anything you can get integrated into a motherboard.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.200]   I mean, audio quality to performance with, especially some of the newer games that use
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.800]   up to 120 channels of audio simultaneously, especially some of the massive multiplayer
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   stuff.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.680]   There is a reason to have it, but you're right.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.920]   I doubt there's going to be a new sound card company jumping in to fill that space anytime soon.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.440]   Creative had hoped to make a good business out of its, in fact, they were one of the
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.160]   very early MP3 players, the creative diamond Rio.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.440]   Give them credit for popularizing MP3 because they're the ones that brought up the first
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   MP3 player.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.120]   They got enough attention that the RIAA sued them.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:53.360]   And in the process, popularized, they would, MP3 format would probably be languishing right
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.560]   now if it wasn't for the RIAA suing creative labs for their original players.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.740]   And now Creative's back in court suing Apple, saying that Apple stole the user interface
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.760]   for the iPod from Creative.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.120]   Now, Creative's patent was filed in 2001, but they didn't get it to last year.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.120]   I don't know.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   That doesn't look like.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.920]   And I've seen a lot of the creative players.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.240]   But I've never seen anything as slick as the iPod interface from anybody but Apple.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.400]   I don't get it.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.680]   Because the patent is just really for hierarchical menus where you click a category and you go
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.080]   down, you go into the category and you get a list of songs and so forth.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.520]   Ooh, nested sub directories.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.520]   There's an invention.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.120]   And I think the key on the iPod UI is the click wheel.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.080]   I mean, I think one of the reasons people spy the iPod is because it has such a superior
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.600]   user interface to anything their creative has come up with.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.920]   I think all that will come up this is that they'll end up litigating.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.200]   Somebody will settle or Apple end up getting Creative's bogus patent overturned and that
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.360]   will be the end of it.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.120]   It's a classic though, an American business.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.880]   If you can't beat him in the marketplace, take him to court.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.920]   Now I was reading that Apple turned around in suit Creative today or yesterday.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   What was that about?
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.920]   That's what I'm curious.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.880]   Well, that's kind of the question nobody quite knows as far as Engadget says that there's
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.240]   no details actually as to what they've turned around and sued them for.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.480]   But apparently it's outside the realm of this kind of interface patent.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.160]   So it looks like Apple was sort of digging some dirt on Creative.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.040]   What's creative was digging the dirt on that, man.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.880]   Well, Apple's probably got a few patents in their portfolio that Creative violated too.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.880]   I'm sure.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.080]   I mean, that's what the Silicon Valley story is always about.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.840]   But you know, the more interesting suits since we're on the topic is the semantic suits
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   suing Microsoft.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.640]   They want to stop Vista.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.640]   No.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.560]   This is a classic.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.920]   Tell us what happens, John.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:50.680]   Well, apparently, you know, somewhere along the lines, Microsoft got hold of something,
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.200]   I guess, Veritec, I believe.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.320]   In fact, let me get this story up.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.320]   The, here it is.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   Veritec.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.320]   Oh, it's the Veritec.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.320]   Veritec.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:07.720]   Veritec designed a file structure of some sort, some way of stories, what they call a storage
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.080]   technology.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.760]   And semantic, of course, bought them, and now there's a debate over whether or not Microsoft
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.400]   got the full rights to use this stuff or not.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.160]   And they're, and semantics as they didn't, and Microsoft said they did.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.120]   There may be some merit to this because Microsoft admits they're using it.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.920]   They licensed it in 1996.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   Right.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.160]   So it really comes down to what that license agreement allows them to do.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.400]   And you know, I don't understand how these things get this far.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.240]   You either have the paperwork or you don't.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.040]   I mean, is there a paper work?
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:42.720]   I mean, this is a saying that Microsoft tricked the patent office to granting patents.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.200]   Not that Microsoft would ever trick anybody.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.120]   Well, I think what's good about, or interesting about this story at least, is the fact that
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.680]   Microsoft, you know, which is responsible for the BSA and all these, you know, these
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:00.320]   somewhat nefarious lawsuits that they were, you know, that make people do these audits
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   and do this all this stuff.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.280]   And I mean, now they're in a position, you know, and by the way, if you do an audit, you
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.360]   don't have the right paperwork.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.720]   You know, you have to pay all these fees or fines.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.480]   Now Microsoft's not going to have the shoe.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.680]   You know, they have to deal with this kind of situation with their paperwork, which,
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.400]   you know, could be lost for all we know.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   According to the Symantec, Microsoft was so bold as to file fraudulent documents with
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:27.160]   the US government, claiming stake to Veritas inventions.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.440]   There are Microsoft patents.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:34.240]   In other words, Microsoft patented something that Symantec says Veritas actually invented
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.400]   and, yeah, that's a pretty interesting trick.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.360]   Yeah, very rarely in today's day and age can you get away with that.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.720]   I mean, even a lot of these fraudulent patents suits don't get very far anymore because there's
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.240]   so many people on the internet that are combing these things over that once these things show
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.720]   up in the literature, as it were, you know, on the online literature.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.480]   I mean, everybody's gets, the word gets out real fast.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   I think that's what happened.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.120]   You know, Microsoft can't do, can't pull a stunt like that and get away with it.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.120]   Any other lawsuits come?
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.200]   This is the lawsuit happy issue of Twitter.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.920]   Oh, yes, actually there is another lawsuit.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.880]   ICM, which is the company behind their registrar.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.360]   They're the ones behind the triple X domain.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.280]   They were, you know, we talked about this last week.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:24.800]   I can't decide it not to allow it mostly because they would have to enforce it and they didn't
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   want to.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.000]   ICM is suing the two departments of the US government for access to documents.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.040]   The claims showed that the US government pressured ICANN into rejecting the domain.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.080]   They're suing the Department of Commerce and the Department of State, saying that the
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.560]   government said, don't do it.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.120]   Now, somebody told me actually after our show, somebody sent me an email saying, no, the
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.240]   real problem was ICANN didn't want to be put in the position of enforcing this triple
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   X domain.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.920]   Well, sir, to enforce.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.440]   Well, I guess the theory would be forced.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.840]   They don't enforce the dot org or the, the else in the book.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.840]   Is it not EDU?
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.840]   No.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.920]   Now, would that company make money from the sale of triple X domain?
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.920]   Yes.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.920]   Okay.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.960]   So there's the whole reason right there because nobody was unhappy with that decision.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:16.880]   I mean, the, the porn industry, the parent teachers, people or the, the concerned parents,
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.280]   group, whatever, everybody was happy at the way that went down because ICANN didn't want
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   to be the enforcement agent.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.680]   Like you mentioned, the triple X folks don't want to, I mean, the, the pornography industry
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:32.440]   didn't want to get into the position of being forced into a domain where, or basically,
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.280]   you know, nobody's going to be able to really enforce it.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.720]   And then you end up with people who have both the dot com and the triple X domain names
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   and just that complete mess.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   So I wanted it.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.080]   I'm the only one who wanted it apparently.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.440]   Oh, I want one, but it's a good idea.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.840]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   It's a great idea.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.840]   Come on.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.840]   It would, well, and we talked about this last year.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.000]   I mean, yeah, I don't think you ever would ever catch to the point where it would be any,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.920]   any use and maybe it never would, but at least it's a start right now.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.280]   We're doing absolutely nothing about all the net.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   Nothing.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   Nothing.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.840]   And one more lawsuit to round out our lawsuit stories.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.880]   We need some, we need to do a legal show, not a, not a tech show.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:17.640]   Uh, a lawyer in Pennsylvania is suing Linden lab, the publisher of Second Life saying the
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.480]   company unfairly confiscated his virtual land.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.800]   The guy had a technique, a trick for, for, uh, essentially cheating the auction system
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.200]   in, in Second Life.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.440]   That's, this is the virtual world that we're talking about.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:39.160]   And he was able to, by taking the URL for the auction and substituting the user ID by
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.920]   land much more cheaply than it was worth.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.680]   And so he's a speculator.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.640]   And then of course he wants to sell it.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.200]   The Linden lab found out, they said under the terms of service, you're, you're out of
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.920]   here and the guy's now suing say, but wait a minute, I had thousands of dollars sunk
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.280]   into virtual land.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.880]   I mean, real thousands of dollars sunk into virtual land.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:06.400]   I want it back is, uh, I love stories like this.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.560]   And I only because I just love it that these virtual worlds are becoming so much like reality.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.400]   People take the same taxes on that land soon.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   You bet.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   You're going to go, that would end it.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.120]   That'd be all.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.480]   I, you know, I read these stories that just shaped my head like, wow, this is the weirdest
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.400]   thing I've ever read.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:33.200]   Finally, the judge issues a split decision in the AT&T privacy lawsuit.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.400]   This is a story we've been covering for a while.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:43.000]   The electronic frontier foundation sued AT&T saying they illegally gave the NSA those
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.280]   internet and telephone records without a court order or a warrant.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.880]   The judge kind of split the baby on this one.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.680]   Uh, he made, he made both sides unhappy, I guess.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:02.720]   Um, let me see what the federal, I'm trying to find the quote from the federal judge.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.840]   He ordered the EFF not to give the document.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:12.240]   The problem is the, these documents that the EFF got for its lawsuit.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.200]   The government says they want them back.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.440]   You can't release these documents.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.960]   This would, for security reasons.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.160]   So the government won in the sense that the judge said, you got to hold onto those documents,
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.680]   but the EFF won because the judge said, but the justice department can't have them back.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.640]   The justice department tried to classify the documents as military secrets.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:36.760]   But in fact, they're now useless because the EFF can't really do anything.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.680]   Nobody can look at them.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.200]   The AT&T says they hold sensitive trade secrets.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.920]   The government says they, they hold military secrets and the electronic frontier foundation
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.480]   says the only way we could pursue this lawsuit.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.840]   The judge said, we'll just hold onto it.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.400]   We'll figure this out later.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.120]   Does it, does it strike anyone else?
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.400]   Is that something, something very suspicious is going on and that the response in this
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.720]   particular case is being particular with AT&T and such is that they are trying to hide
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.720]   something.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.720]   Clearly.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   You just wouldn't be acting that way if you weren't guilty.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.400]   Yeah, they're trying to hide the fact that if they did something wrong, it's going to
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.120]   cost them a fortune and fines.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.080]   But who's going to find them, not the government?
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.680]   Well, I mean, you can always take a class action suit against them.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   I'm sure something somewhere.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.680]   Well, no, isn't it?
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   It's not money.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.440]   Isn't it precisely the government that would find them though?
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:36.440]   Because wasn't there something about one of the regulatory bodies in the state says that
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.240]   if you're a phone company and you illegally release phone records?
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.640]   Yeah, so telecommunications act in 1934.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.000]   Yeah, then you're subject to oodles, noodles, or fines.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.840]   And if it turns out that whether it was the government that tried to induce them to release
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.520]   those phone records, doesn't matter.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.000]   So one branch of the government is going to find them for doing another branch of the
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.760]   government asked them to do.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   Absolutely.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:06.360]   I think there was also a story recently in New York.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:15.000]   Time saying that the government was now processing reporters' phone logs in order to, yes, in
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.360]   order to look at the case for suing reporters who were releasing some information that the
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.720]   government wasn't happy with.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.360]   I think it was the original NSA spying story.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.200]   So this is the real fear of all this.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   Right.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.040]   Actually, I was ABC that's been covering this morning on the ABC blogs.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.320]   And I mean, they're now it suddenly becomes very frightening because the government has
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.840]   all of the records, apparently, from multiple phone companies that allow them to do this
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.680]   massive cross-correlation and find out what's going on.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   So suddenly, it's no longer terrorists that we're trying to find.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.240]   Now it's our own reporting industry.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.560]   But they are terrorists because they're revealing what the government's up to.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.760]   Undermining the security of this great nation.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.680]   And that's exactly why this stuff is problematic because it doesn't take long before-
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.000]   It took two weeks for this to happen.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.720]   Yeah, it didn't take long before the government starts criminalizing its own citizens for
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.960]   revealing the actors.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.880]   That's exactly what happened with the Pentagon Papers and Daniel Ellsberg.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.440]   Not to bring back an old story.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.920]   Boy, that's a dated one.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.200]   Stephen Levy writing in Newsweek said an interesting thing.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.040]   He said, you know, the real problem is this information is useless.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   It's too massive.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.480]   There's too much of it.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.760]   This is where he's dead wrong.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.360]   He's dead wrong.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   I mean, this is unbelievably wrong.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.600]   He said they'd be better off starting with the terrorists and building up a tree that way.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   Network analysis.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.160]   You run network analysis tools on these datasets.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.960]   And you can see who's calling who.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.240]   You can build networks up.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.680]   You can see who hangs out with who.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.560]   I mean, I've seen demos of this stuff.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   It's astonishing.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.400]   And the more data you have, the easier it is.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   This is nonsense.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.520]   I don't know where exactly what they want.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.440]   They want the largest database possible to really fine-tune some of this new software.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   Right.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.920]   You don't need the details.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.360]   All you need is the network data.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.160]   And you can pinpoint everything.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   It's kind of scary.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:13.840]   And the piece of software that AT&T installed purportedly can sustain speeds of what?
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.800]   10 gigabits per second?
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.840]   So yeah, that a few times over throughout their ins and outs through their network.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.280]   And they could easily be monitoring every single point to point whatever they want to
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   look at.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.560]   And recently on TV, you'll see commercials now touting that variability.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.320]   It's like your data could not be any more secure.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.840]   We know exactly where it goes and where it comes.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.560]   And I would want that too if it were my business data flying across their networks.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.200]   But at the same point, if they open that up to government with no checks, no balances,
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:49.080]   or very, very apparently limited checks and balances, that just gets a little Orwellian
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.080]   to me.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.720]   John, were these data mining techniques developed for business first or developed by government?
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.520]   The ones I saw, and this was a number of years ago, I mean, this is at least 10 years ago,
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.800]   I saw the Interpol software demo and it showed how you can take and analyze.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.200]   Just you know, you don't have to know what's on the college.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.280]   You just need to see who's calling who and they were showing how you could see how, you
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.120]   know, an organized crime gang was organized, who was talking to who the guy was.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:23.840]   You could take in and the more data you had, the more you could kind of flesh out this
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.840]   information.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.160]   And then by the time you're done, you look at a picture, it's like an org chart.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.320]   It's unbelievable.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   And so that's what's going on.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.000]   I don't know what people are thinking if they think that there's too much data here,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.400]   too much is good.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.400]   More the merrier.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:42.720]   Well, and one of the reasons we have Will on today is because in Britain, in kind of
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:50.400]   a similar story, the British government is asking to start enforcing part three of RIPA,
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.440]   the Regulation of investigatory powers act, which has been around for some years, the
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.160]   government hasn't put part three into effect.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.080]   Nick, Will, why don't I keep calling you Nick?
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   I don't know why.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.480]   Will, do you want to explain what part three is all about?
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.480]   Sure.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.800]   So parts one and two of the act have been enforced since like 2000.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.200]   And they basically are like a legal framework for how the government can use like electronic
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.280]   surveillance and also human surveillance.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:26.800]   So part three is about extended powers for making people reveal cryptographic keys.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:35.920]   So the idea is that if you have a terrorist sends an encrypted message to somebody else
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.560]   and the message is intercepted by the police and the terrorist is apprehended, but of course
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.920]   they don't know what the terrorist has said.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:47.880]   So they've made it, they've they want to make it a criminal offense to refuse to provide
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:54.880]   the key to decrypt the message that's being sent that the police wants to know about.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.760]   That is basically the sort of just that tells you one.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.760]   Good thing that at least some of the high end commercial and encryption available to consumers
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.160]   is strong enough.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.160]   It works.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   Absolutely.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   Absolutely.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.320]   And it's basically there's been a bit of an outcry in the British press about this.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   Well, I think rightly so.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.480]   I mean, if they start forcing and by the way, you don't I mean, you don't have to be a
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.480]   terrorist.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   You just have to be a suspected terrorist.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.840]   And if you say, no, I'm not giving you the keys.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.080]   They don't have to prove anything else.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   They throw you in jail.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.280]   The problem is that so there are there are a number of problems with it.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   Number one is the definition of terrorism.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:32.640]   And the definition of terrorism under this act is anybody that seeks to change the opinion
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.120]   of the government and anybody that seeks to challenge state power.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.120]   So like the New York Times or any of the any protests.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.920]   That's number one.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.400]   Number two is that there are the civil liberties issue.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.680]   And the problem is that there are no firm guidelines actually set out in the laws.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.800]   It's all shunted to these kind of Nambi Pambi codes of practice that nobody really looks
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   at.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.920]   So that's sort of number two.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:03.520]   Number three is that it's practically really difficult to enforce because number one, if
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:09.000]   you've got a stream of data, how do you know what's junk and what's crypto?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.400]   Number two is that there's nothing to stop someone saying, Oh, well, that message you
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   intercepted from me is just like a love letter to my girlfriend.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.000]   And she had to like random data.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.280]   And by the way, I lost the key to the cryptid.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.640]   So I'm really sorry about that.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.440]   And you can't prove that somebody is withholding the key from you.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   Well, what about it, Steve?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.640]   I mean, that's true.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.280]   That's what true crypt does for instance.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.040]   They offer plausible deniability there.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   Data is indistinguishable from noise.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.480]   Well, and there are lots of technologies too that would make it impossible even for the
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:47.800]   people who participated in the conversation to to subsequently decrypt it.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.760]   You could randomly change the key as soon as you initiate the connection and that gets
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:00.040]   encrypted and nobody is able to turn back the clock and get the key that's already gone.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.320]   I mean, it's called perfect forward security.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.800]   And you know, you and I talked about that where where if a key becomes compromised at
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:14.240]   some time in the future, nothing that has been done prior to that key compromise can
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.440]   can be decrypted.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:21.280]   So I mean, there are technologies that that you just can't legislate in this fashion.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:26.200]   And I mean, and I really to be honest, because I was sure that as soon as that the US government
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.440]   was watching this with great interest, if it if it survived in Britain that they were
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.960]   going to implement it here in the States.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:37.360]   Yeah, I mean, we're we really have a problem with the way things are moving because we
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:45.400]   know, as you and I have talked in our security now podcast, there exists now extremely available
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:53.520]   absolutely, you know, for all practical purposes, unbreakable crypto that everyone can have.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:00.080]   And governments really dislike the idea that they're not able to eavesdrop or or pursue
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.880]   for for law enforcement purposes, you know, the the transactions that are happening over
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   these encrypted channels.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.400]   And it's it's really the case that our government can't crack this.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:17.600]   And I mean, I don't see any logical outcome if the government refuses to allow this to
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.160]   go on other than outlawing cryptography or out of the classes that they don't have back
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.680]   doors to a they have tried to outlaw cryptography a couple of times.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.320]   Clipper, if you remember about I think the first attempt was about 15 years ago, they
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.920]   tried to do that and then they tried again.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.400]   And they just haven't been successful.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.720]   But I mean, they still can attempt to outlaw it.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.200]   I mean, there's also something which we should mention, which is nested encryption, which
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:49.440]   you have where you have a fake password that really releases what looks like in a cryptophile
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.240]   and then you actually have something else buried.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   Sure.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.880]   Well, of course, the problem is that it's the reason no government really wants to completely
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.280]   ban cryptography when they think about it is that it's so bad for business.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:07.920]   I mean, you can't have major banks doing business where they don't have strong encryption.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.840]   Because money could go anywhere.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.720]   Well, you could have a government backdoor to that encryption, however.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   Well, exactly.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.720]   A mandate of that door.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.320]   Yeah, the banks don't want that either.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.600]   And the UK, one of the major problems was that the thing that really makes a mockery of this
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.680]   law is that the sentence, like for refusing to give up your cryptography, is two years.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:35.320]   Well, of course, if you're a serious criminal doing serious business, you'll take the two
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.960]   years rather than give up the evidence which might indict you for life or something.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.720]   So on a practical basis, it's kind of a stupid thing.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.920]   Well, don't give many ideas.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.920]   You're going to take this.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   You're going to now make it.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.160]   I mean, I'll put myself in law enforcement's shoes.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.200]   It must be extremely frustrating to them that it's now very easy for anybody to encrypt
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.440]   stuff such a way that they can't see it.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.960]   Well, I remember talking to the Secret Service a few years ago and I said, "How do you handle
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.960]   that?"
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.400]   And they said, "Well, you usually give us the password."
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.200]   And he said, almost always a criminal will unencrypt or give you the password if you ask
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   them nicely.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.600]   Well, they've done some pretty fancy things.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:16.840]   A few years ago, the FBI planted who, what, when I think, are one of those key loggers.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.720]   And there's hardware key loggers now that can't be detected under any circumstances.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.000]   You can talk to anybody about this.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.080]   You can get them out of New Zealand.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.400]   And they plant, they go in a bus into somebody's place and then they plant like this.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   It's like putting a bug in an office.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.480]   And they just wait till the guy types the password a few times and bingo.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.720]   The guy's bus, there was a guy at Jersey mobster that was caught that way.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.120]   And I think it probably goes on a lot.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.120]   I mean, just, you know, it's a--
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.880]   So you say they don't need these kinds of bugs?
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.360]   There's old fashioned ways of catching crooks.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.400]   They don't need section three is what you're saying.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.120]   No, of course not.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.720]   And it's a bad idea anyway.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   Businesses are going to like it.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   We all agree on that.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   Well, it scares me because, and it just makes me want to encrypt everything.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.160]   Come and get me, Carver.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.760]   Well, of course, then the other, there's been another new law proposed in the UK, or at
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   least come out in the press this week, which wants to criminalize sort of system admins
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   and the scriptors and things like this.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   Yeah, talk about that.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   I thought that was hysterical.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   All right.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   It's just amusing.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:24.160]   It's basically it would be illegal to write a computer program which quote could be used
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.320]   for sort of illegal purposes like hacking, denial of service, et cetera.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.560]   And of course, the problem is that almost any tool can be used for anything.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.680]   So if you write something like, you know, Perl or N-Map, of course, that can be used for
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.040]   nefarious purposes, but it's a legitimate system admin tool.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:46.120]   But under this law, if you wrote Perl today or tomorrow when it's enforced, you'd be subject
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.960]   to time in the clink, which is just--
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.840]   This is not a law yet.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   Is it?
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   I mean, this is a proposed--
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.840]   It's not yet.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.120]   And this was one of these examples of lawmakers just not having a clue about those things that
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.480]   don't know anything about anything.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   It's unbelievable.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.680]   Yeah, but they're in charge.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.800]   Well, I mean, they usually supposed to have advisors, at least they can tell them about
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   this stuff and say, "Hey, this is crazy."
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.240]   I wish somebody would.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.760]   Yeah, it's not very clever.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.560]   We talked about Blue Security last week.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:25.760]   This is the anti-spam service that had a do-not-intrude list if you subscribed and you became a Blue Security
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.760]   customer and you got spammed.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.080]   Blue Security would politely ask the spammer to cease and desist and get you off the list.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:38.360]   Of course, they were shut down by spammers who were mad about this and then not only
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:43.840]   that, but when Blue Security moved its blog over to TypePad, the spammers shut down TypePad
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.560]   as well and put thousands of blogs off the ear.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.880]   Now Blue Security says, "You know, we give up.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.360]   You win.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:58.040]   We are going out of business because we don't want our anti-spam technology to create an
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.440]   ever-escalating cyberwar through our continued operations."
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.000]   I think it's kind of sad.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.760]   Well, it looks like the talent was on the wrong side of that argument.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.560]   I guess so.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.800]   What really probably happened behind the scenes, too, is that they had a relationship with whatever
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:19.040]   bandwidth provider where they were having to end up bearing the cost of the dial order
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.720]   of the attack exactly.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.560]   So somewhere there was a huge bill involved and they just had to say, "Finally, okay,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   we can't continue this.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   We can't sustain this."
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.040]   You know, it's sad.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.360]   They had half a million users and the people I've talked to who were Blue Security subscribers
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.800]   were very happy with it.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   They said it was very effective in eliminating spam.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   Hey, you can always go to my guy.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.200]   I don't get any spam.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.480]   I get no spam to Vorak.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:51.840]   Actually, I think that that ultimately really is the answer to this, is that these kinds
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   of...
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.560]   You can't interact with spammers.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.600]   That's not the way to stop spam.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.120]   If you can't throw them in jail, there's no point in trying to talk them out of it.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.760]   Or they'll unleash a 10,000-bot attack on your system.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   Exactly.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.400]   All you could do is use technology.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   As your guy is doing, John, is using technology to filter the spam out.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.000]   Yeah, you can go to my blog and click on it.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.400]   I get no spam and you'll find out all about it.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.080]   Not that I'm here to promote things.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   And your blog address would be...
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:29.040]   Dvorak.org/blog and it's junkemailfilter.com, which is Mark Perkel.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.040]   Mark's just using some well-known tools.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.400]   He's using a lot of tools.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   But he stays on top of it and that's what kind of what makes it work.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.160]   So let's see, we've got lawsuits to stop Vista.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.440]   By the way, you think they'll be able to get an injunction against Vista?
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.720]   Are you kidding?
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.720]   They won't need one.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   Right.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720]   They don't need one.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.760]   The lawsuit will be over two years from now, just before a Vista comes out.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.000]   It'll never ship anyway.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.400]   Lawsuits to stop the iPod, but the iPod out of business.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   Yes or no?
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.800]   No chance of success there.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   Everyone hates a winner.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.240]   They do, don't they?
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.360]   The Brits are trying to shut down encryption.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   I think that's going to...
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.080]   We agreed now that's hopeless and useful.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.320]   Attorney Seals Sue's Second Life to get his money back.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.320]   Hopeless.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.480]   And of course, you forgot to mention the Blackberry countersuit.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.680]   That's another lawsuit that has to be on the list.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.400]   Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.160]   So Blackberry...
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.520]   What's the deal?
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.680]   I don't know, I never follow it, but it's that...
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   Are they suing the other guy?
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.400]   I mean, I followed this early on.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.680]   I kept pretty good taps on it and then I just gave up.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.760]   Is Blackberry suing NTP now or no?
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.000]   No, there was another company.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   He's suing Vista.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.800]   Vista, that's right.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   Vista's suing.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.480]   So NTP sued Blackberry, one, got a big settlement.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.840]   Then Vista comes along and says, "Oh yeah, we have patents too."
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.720]   And now they're trying to put Blackberry out of business.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.520]   You're saying Blackberry's countersuing Vista?
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:57.400]   That's what it says in the ZDnet story.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.360]   Oh man, you know, one good thing...
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.400]   I think one thing you can determine from all of this is that it's a good idea to be a
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.400]   lawyer.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.160]   Are you regretting now will not go in and get in your...
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.240]   Finishing your degree?
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.240]   No I don't.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.040]   I'd like to sleep at night, you know?
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.680]   And not upside down.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.720]   No, it is sad.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.960]   From one perspective, it sort of represents the maturation of our industry, but at the
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:32.080]   same time, this is all inevitable consequences to a very broken patent system.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.120]   I mean, we've known the patent system and not been functioning for 20 years.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   And people said, "Oh, look, it's bad.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.120]   It's broken.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.560]   It doesn't work right."
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:50.520]   And now as business begins to turn to legislation instead of creativity, this is what happens.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.960]   And people like Symantec are suing Microsoft and everybody's suing everybody.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.160]   Yeah, well, it's not just the patents though.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:02.000]   I mean, just last week, talked about the Beatles and the Apple and the music and then
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   the copyright.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.080]   And finally, or trademark, that was a trademark issue.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.640]   And then finally, you know, Apple finally wins.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.960]   And then on top of that, the McCartney's wife, you know, has a sues him or goes going
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.960]   to sue him for divorce.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.960]   And it's like suit suits.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.960]   It's unbelievable.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.160]   This is like, you know, the beginning of the end of Western civilization, the way I see
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   it.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.160]   End of days.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.320]   Well, no, the rapture.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:30.400]   Don't they in Britain have a system that reduces the amount of litigation going on?
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.520]   I know in Canada, they require that losing a little bit here and there.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.480]   They make an effort to try and stop people.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.640]   It seems like something a real hobby in the States, you know, it's...
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.840]   Although if they have a system where they're trying not to have so many lawsuits, why are
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.960]   they trying to legislate against cryptography?
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.520]   Well, there you go.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.240]   The one thing that keeps us have our privacy and security on the internet.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.880]   Yes, let's outlaw that immediately.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:02.640]   So Robert, a couple of weeks ago, you said you were going to be looking at the new HD DVD
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   players.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.640]   Are you happy with them?
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   It's beautiful.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.160]   You know, it's a total first gen product, especially the $500 unit from Toshiba, the low
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.160]   end one.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.960]   A little low end one.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   Isn't that a Linux?
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.760]   Isn't that really a Linux box?
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   It is indeed.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.840]   It's a gig of RAM from what I understand.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   Wow.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.840]   P4 processor.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:21.840]   Can you...
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.840]   It's up like a PC.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   Can you get it?
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.840]   It's a boot Linux.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.080]   I mean, put a, you know, put a Mio on it and use it as a computer.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.160]   If you do the firmware update for it, if one's ever released, you actually have to click
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.320]   OK on the GPL license or whatever.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.080]   It's pretty cool though.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.280]   I mean, it's all open source software internally, so...
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.280]   That's actually good.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:43.360]   One of the reasons that the Tivo was so hackable is they couldn't really prevent it because
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.360]   of the GPL.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.360]   It was...
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.640]   You know, you can't really say, well, you can't modify our kernel because that's kind
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.040]   of the license agreement of the kernel.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.160]   So maybe this will be a very hackable device.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.840]   What sort of content is available now in HD DVD?
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.240]   Right now, last look on Amazon.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:06.720]   I think there are actually about 15 titles available with another 15, 20, 30 coming very
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.880]   soon.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.280]   That's strike one for the average person buying it.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.040]   There's simply not enough available yet.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.920]   It's a lot to pay for a player that plays 30 movies.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.840]   You really get those movies memorized.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.360]   Oh, but the image quality is stunning.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   No doubt.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.880]   So what movies did you look at and what TV did you use and all that stuff?
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:35.360]   I was using a brand new HP, rear projection, 1080p, the LP set, gorgeous TV.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.160]   They're 5880, I believe it is.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.160]   That hooked up...
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.680]   I did it a couple of different ways.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.040]   I actually took the HD DVD player and went directly into the TV, 1080i.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.600]   What's the horizontal on that?
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   For the 1080, the...
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   1920 by 1080.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.040]   Is it really 1920, you sure?
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   Yes.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:50:01.840]   It accepts those resolutions, whether or not your average 1080p display will display the
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.800]   finest details of a 1080i signal or 1080p signal.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.680]   That's something else entirely.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.600]   You were talking about the TV at this point.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.680]   What does the output of the HD DVD player?
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   1080i.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   And that's another limitation.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   The format on the disc itself is 1080p content.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:29.680]   And currently I believe they're all using VC1, which is Microsoft's media center 9 format.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   Oh, they really, they are.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.680]   Well, there's three different formats that both Blu-ray and HDVD will use.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.680]   VC1 is the one I'm seeing the most of right now.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.680]   The manufacturer can choose to encode the DVD in one of those three different codecs.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.680]   Totally.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   And the player can play any of the three.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   Exactly.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   Does the disc tell you...
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.800]   Does it tell you on the box how it's encoded?
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   It does not.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   That's something else.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   It was just...
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   It was, I believe, was it universal, whoever handed some of the first content?
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.080]   That's how they described it in their press releases.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.080]   They told you.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.080]   So...
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.880]   Is there a reason for consumers to care or are they all equal?
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:06.880]   No.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.880]   If anything, it'll just...
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.880]   It'll be more about seeing how mature the encoders become.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:18.560]   Granted, you have so much data to work with in terms of providing the image on the screen.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:24.120]   But making it as best as possible, and also it'll be more about what sources they've
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.720]   dragged this from, is it a good film scan?
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   Right.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.080]   Was it digital to begin with?
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.280]   Well, and those things will start to pop up.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:36.160]   I'm noticing for some of the film transfers, in particular, good fellows, which it is the
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.680]   best looking version of that movie I think I've ever seen.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   See, I almost buy that just to watch good...
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   I mean, good fellows is a good enough movie that I think that'd be almost worth it to
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.720]   be able to see it as good as it could be.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.240]   And I'm noticing also for a lot of the film transfer DVDs I look at, you see Film Grain.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:58.280]   And I'm not seeing as much in some of the HDVD film transfers, which is kind of interesting.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:03.440]   Because some people, depending on the TV, it can turn into a noisy looking mess for bad
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:08.960]   TVs, but for good TV, that Film Grain almost lends that theater quality to the video itself.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.560]   And that's kind of nice in a sense.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.880]   But you think they're paying more attention to the encoding?
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   Absolutely.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.920]   So just for the quality alone.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.640]   I haven't seen any...
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.160]   The detail is so much better now, they have to.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:25.960]   And if anything, it's just simply going to show off issues of how the movie was put together
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   to begin with, be it a lighting error or somebody's bad makeup or everything is just so much
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   more detailed.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:38.320]   I mean, they say it is six times the progressive resolution, but with your eye looking at the
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:44.520]   screen DVD in one hand, HDVD in the other, you will honestly be able to see two or three
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.160]   times the detail, no doubt about it.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.480]   And it's just phenomenal.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.120]   But this first generation player, again, it only supports the one format.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.400]   It doesn't give you true access if you have a 1080p TV.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.000]   You're sending 1080i into it.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.280]   And I've processed it through a really high-end processor into 1080p and then looked at it
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.600]   on the TV.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.880]   And it gets really hard for me to say if there's a difference or not without taking a bunch
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.440]   of pictures and comparing AB.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:14.160]   And that's really, I think for most people, it's going to be the only way that really
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.560]   see a difference is looking at it side by side properly set up.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.040]   But it'll be an upscaling player.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:25.280]   There's no comparison between an upscaled DVD and an HDVD, especially on the large TV.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.080]   So if you take a DVD and you stick it in this thing, and by the way, I want to sympathize
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.520]   with everybody out there listening to these guys throwing around, the fact that they'd
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.680]   pay $500 for a player just to watch one movie.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.560]   Hey, but people out there were three-year-old laptops.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:39.560]   I'm being facetious.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.040]   But anyway, no other players.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.040]   You're a deal.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.040]   You got too much money.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.040]   No, no, I wouldn't do that.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.000]   I'm just thinking it is a good movie.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   No, let's go.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   I want to ask this question.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.040]   Does the thing do line doubling, line tripling, line quadrupling when it runs a regular DVD
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.120]   through it or what?
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.320]   It scales up as well.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.320]   And it appeared to do a pretty good job.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:02.600]   Hey, remember that it has a gig of memory in it, and that's what Leo paid for his gig.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   That's true.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.600]   That's true.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   That's a dollar.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   I didn't.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   He could actually gotten less memory than the three.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.200]   I didn't buy the two gig of memory.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.560]   I turned it down because it was too expensive.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.560]   Oh, that's right.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.200]   Let me pay the $100 for the one gig.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   That's right.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.960]   The way you just said it, Leo, I was under the impression that you had bought the memory
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.440]   and said, you know, I'll spend this kind of money, but I think you suck and then you
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.240]   busted it up and threw it in their face.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.760]   Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   I did, John.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   That's it, exactly.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.960]   And then a little $100 bill and a lot that place.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.320]   So there, take that Steve Jobs.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:40.880]   But what you expect the second gen of HDDB players to add to this?
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.080]   1080p number one.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.400]   I would wait for 1080p, wouldn't you?
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.000]   You know what?
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.280]   Most people don't have 1080p TVs and large enough screen size to rewind.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.240]   Really notice the difference.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.560]   And I mean, I'm looking at some 40.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:01.360]   Anything below, say, 42 inches for 1080p, it almost gets ridiculous because the pixels
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:06.400]   become so small that it becomes really hard to see a difference between that, say, and
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.800]   something with maybe 720p resolution.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.800]   But the other thing, hopefully, they'll have a dedicated processor, which will help speed
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:18.000]   up some of the startup times and the point you actually put the disc in the player and
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.520]   hit the play button to the point you're actually watching the movie.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.480]   Tell us your feeling for that.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.480]   How long does it take?
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.960]   It sounds to me as though you could drive to the theater and the amount of time you're
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:27.960]   still in the theater.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.560]   I'll be honest, let's see, from the point you put the disc in, there has to be a minimum,
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.200]   I'd say, of 30 seconds before it even realizes that it's an HDVD disc.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.160]   Give it, say, another 30 seconds.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:44.760]   This is not a lot of time, but it's not like my standard DVD player sitting in my living
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   room.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.560]   But I'd say at least another 30 seconds after that before you actually get that first pop-ups
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.240]   here, welcome to HDVD, yadda yadda.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:58.800]   And then finally, you get to where you can hit play on the thing.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:03.760]   Also just the user interface in terms of the remote and everything, there's lots of room
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.320]   for improvement there.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:10.080]   It literally was thrown out, but there's actually buttons on the remote that either
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.680]   don't function or have no function or, oh, we just didn't have time to fully clean this
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.680]   up.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.520]   But if you have to have it and you can, and there are some titles out there that you like,
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.400]   once it's playing, you really don't care about all of that.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:31.720]   You know, the issue with the UI fascinates me because what's wrong with the old UI that
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.240]   the DVD players use, it seemed adequate.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:39.520]   Why do we move to a next generation and the next thing you know, the UI falls apart?
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.080]   That makes no sense to me.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:46.280]   Yeah, that was more, it has mostly to do with just, it's a Linux box and there are certain
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   delays involved.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:53.120]   It's like, well, once it's set up and properly running and the movie finally gets up, it's
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.120]   beautiful.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:58.120]   But the other thing too is that within the, for HDDVD at least, for what we've looked
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:02.440]   at, it's the menu systems involved now are awesome.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.280]   That upgrade alone is really different.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:09.640]   You get a translucent, lower third basically that'll pop up on all of the disks.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.120]   All of the disks seem to be processed in a way that gives you thumbnail views of all
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:18.040]   the chapter titles now which you can breeze through backwards and forwards.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.360]   And potentially with the ethernet connection that's on the back of the thing, you'll be
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.720]   able to access web content that's related to the movie and things like that.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.120]   That's a lot of stuff I don't care about but some people might.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.200]   And the user interface in that sense is really nice.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:37.480]   It's just sometimes you get hiccups, pauses, that sort of thing needs to be just massaged
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   out.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.400]   And I'm sure a firmware update will take care of that.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   I have yet to see one.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.760]   But I'll be honest with you though, I don't want to own two different DVD players for
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:52.040]   this format war that the darn companies have started.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.800]   For my money, I'm holding off for one that plays both.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.240]   It's just I don't see it.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.600]   They obviously are not going to come to terms and unify on anything.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.680]   And there will be two formats for us.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.040]   So of course one of the problems with the PlayStation 3 Sony is touting this ability
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:11.400]   to play Blu-ray but it is only Blu-ray and it is only a first generation player.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:16.200]   It's going to have all these teething issues that you're going to see with HD DVD.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.680]   And so a lot of people say, well, I know a lot of people that are holding off for the
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.120]   second generation because like anything you buy into the first generation and you've
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.280]   got all the bugs and problems and PS3 customers who are kind of more mainstream maybe, they
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.280]   want a sort of slightly more mature experience maybe.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.800]   Yeah but you wouldn't, you're not going to see the first universal player coming from
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.520]   Sony of all people.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:37.520]   They're a Blu-ray house.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.520]   They're not going to do it.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.640]   They're going to rise into the price of the announced price for the PS3.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:47.720]   It sounds expensive and it is in a sense but if you add on the HD DVD drive that Microsoft
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:52.920]   announced at, with a stop and announced a price for that drive yet but if you paired
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.680]   that with the 360 it would be at least as much money.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.400]   But at least Microsoft gives you that option though.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.400]   It's like, look, you know what, I don't care about the HD DVD part, just I want to play
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.320]   my game so okay I can knock a couple hundred bucks off that.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:11.000]   Microsoft is actually saying that the HD DVD and the 360 will be cheaper than the PS3.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.520]   The DVD, they actually come out of the commands.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.360]   It's maybe less than 900 bucks for the DVD.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:18.000]   That's nice.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.460]   And Sony's, to their credit, their game consoles have always been the best DVD players for standard
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.120]   DVD playback compared to anybody else.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:31.320]   I mean the 360 and the original Xbox are two of the worst DVD players on the planet.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:35.320]   That's just my, I mean, I wouldn't be looking at my game consoles.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:39.320]   Going in, when you say that Sony's always made a great DVD player with all their, what
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.040]   do you mean always, how many did they have they done?
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.040]   Well the PS2.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.040]   One.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.040]   One.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.040]   One.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.040]   One.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.040]   One.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.040]   One.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.040]   One.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.040]   One.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.040]   One.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   One.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   One.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.040]   One.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.040]   Thank you.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.400]   Do all of these HD DVD players Blu-ray or HD DVD playback the old D style DVDs?
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.400]   That's given.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.400]   That has to.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.400]   Of course, yeah.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.400]   They both will.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.080]   And they do a good job of it.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.800]   Although nobody has a Blu-ray player, so I got Eno technically working.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.000]   He's making it up.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.240]   No, not making it up.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.920]   I mean this is what's been announced, but.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920]   No, they have to.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.920]   They have to.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.920]   They have to.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920]   They have to.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.920]   Well, they don't play each other's format.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   I can see whether.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.720]   Yeah, no, they're going to be backwards compatible.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.120]   Come on, Samsung, put that universal player out of town.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.160]   Samsung pulled a plug on that and before a good reason.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.600]   Apparently it was a big secret, but now everybody knows that there's a licensing deal
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600]   with Blu-ray.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.880]   If you do Blu-ray, you cannot do the other one.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.880]   Is that it?
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.880]   In combo drive.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.880]   That's the reason we're not going to see one.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.040]   You know, I was at HP last week down at their quarters looking at some of their new
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.920]   stuff and they have.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:43.760]   They used to be firmly in one camp or the other with the previous generation of recordable
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.000]   DVD media.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.800]   They were the big plus group.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.080]   I mean, and they were they were bordering on being the mafia about how much they tried
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.760]   to shove that down anybody's throat who would listen.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.200]   But this time around, they're they're taking the stance where we will give our customers
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.200]   whatever they want.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.400]   I'm hoping they're not going to do a combo drive.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.840]   That's the provision in the in the deal.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.840]   That's insane.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.040]   John, serenity is on HD DVD.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   Yeah, it is.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.040]   Oh, it's a red.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040]   It's beautiful.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040]   Serendity or firefly?
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   Serendity.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   It's a movie.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.040]   See, I like to show better than the movie.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.840]   I thought I mean the movie's great.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:26.160]   Serendity Apollo 13 born supremacy fifth element phantom of the opera doom you five.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.160]   You know, I do one.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   Doom.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.160]   It's going to be a doom.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   I know.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.160]   HD DVD.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.320]   So, you know, interesting collection.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:40.120]   But on a big TV, I got to say side by side, I mean, I'm talking if you have a 50 inches
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.680]   or bigger and 1080p and you've got year on that cutting edge, you will appreciate the
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.680]   quality.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.080]   The quality is fantastic, but the selection's not there.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080]   Hardware is a little liffy.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]   Okay.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.160]   Can we talk about my Mac book again?
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.040]   We got to get back to where the yoke's been spending the money.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.040]   I want.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.720]   Well, you actually, I do want to ask Nick because one of the complaints about the Mac book pro
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.200]   and apparently it's going to be a similar complaint about the Mac book is that these
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.320]   things run really hot and it seems to be pretty well agreed that they Apple misapplied
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.760]   the thermal grease.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.640]   Have you seen this Nick?
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.640]   Will.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   Will.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   Why do I call you Nick?
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.040]   You don't want to say Nick came up or Nick Jessica Simpson fan.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.040]   I have a dream.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.360]   I'm going back and I'm editing this whole podcast and taking out the nicks.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360]   Will.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.120]   Have you heard that story?
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.960]   Yeah, it looked really interesting.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.040]   I mean, it was sort of like apparently taking them apart.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.200]   It's just not on our list of stories.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.280]   I just throw in this one out because I got a Mac book and I'm worried it's going to be
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.280]   hot.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.960]   Why did you buy it?
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.480]   I don't know because I I lost.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.800]   I couldn't help it.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.280]   The first thing I think of when you talk about all this heat problem is that it's got
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.880]   a bean that it's sucking the battery dry too.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.880]   So it's getting good, very big, good battery life.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880]   But these are hot chips.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.680]   I mean, they're apparently it's got better battery life than the MacBook Pro.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.320]   Apparently, it does like five or six hours rather than three or four.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320]   Right.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.640]   But I think I think if the I mean the MacBook Pro has had the sort of teething issues with
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.800]   the thermal paste, you've got to imagine that Apple's seen those for the MacBook.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   I hope so.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:17.920]   That's why people there's a guy on something awful who's actually opened the thing up,
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.440]   just wobbed away the thermal grease with alcohol and put reapplied it and it brought
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.200]   it literally brought the temperature down like 15 degrees centigrade.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.040]   Huge amount of Leo.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:36.280]   If we hear of a major house fire in your area, it's my HT DVD player.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.280]   It's running too hot.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.960]   All right, John, I want that.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.280]   I won't mention that because it's not on the list.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.240]   John is like the list police.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.120]   That's why yes, because last week you were throwing these stories out at us.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120]   I just think of them.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.120]   They're just thinking about this list.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.320]   Well, yeah, I just thought they come to me.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320]   It's a good story.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.800]   I mean, I never would have thought about the thermal grease being a problem.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   That's pretty funny.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.080]   Apparently, they're being cheesy.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.040]   They're being cheap with the thermal grease and they're not giving them telling them to
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040]   apply enough.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.160]   Well, who's the Apple Apple's instructions?
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160]   Apple Apple's instructions.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.200]   I know I was really surprised when I looked at my FedEx lip.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.920]   It's from Shenzhou, China.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.920]   It's being shipped.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.080]   From one of those big factories, it's probably that, you know, they make it to a cheap but
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.520]   one minute at Dell the next and here comes your Apple.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.080]   And then they go, "Quick, hold off on the thermal paste."
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.560]   And by the way, you got any black flake paint?
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.560]   Oh, you got a...
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.360]   Did you already buy the MacBook Pro?
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360]   No, I didn't buy a Pro.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.360]   I bought a regular cheap one.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.360]   Okay.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.360]   The MacBook, not the Pro.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.480]   I've been waiting because I didn't want to buy the Pro.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   It's too big.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   I wanted a little one.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.560]   Okay, so you didn't go first, Jen.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.800]   So, you know, hopefully the heating issues are taking care of.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.920]   People already have them say they're pretty hot.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.320]   But what about the new Yahoo homepage that doesn't work in Safari?
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.960]   So it won't work on your new MacBook.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960]   Damn.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960]   It doesn't work on Safari?
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960]   No, it works on Firefox.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   Nope.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.840]   You just get a big fat sign saying, "You're a browser's not supported.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.280]   Please use IE or Yahoo."
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.440]   What is Yahoo thinking there?
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.440]   I mean, I...
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.440]   Wow.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.440]   Safari is a problem, I think.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.440]   It's just a bad browser.
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440]   No, Safari is...
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   No, that's not true.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.760]   In fact, Safari is one of two browsers that support the CSS acid test.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.040]   I mean, it's...
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.720]   You know, Firefox can't do it.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.720]   Safari can.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.720]   It's actually very compatible.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.880]   I hear more people complaining about WordPress blogs, not being readable on...
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.880]   Well, now that's ridiculous.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.880]   Oh, no.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.640]   If you can't read a WordPress blog, which is about as vanilla as you can get, I mean,
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.200]   it's not like it's got any special technology.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.560]   The trouble is sometimes the IE requires so many dirty hacks to get CSS work that it
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.560]   kills everything else.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   That's right.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.000]   That's one of the problems that we find constantly designing websites, which is that the amount
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.920]   of stuff you have to do to get IE to work just breaks everything else.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.760]   So I'm going to my new my Yahoo.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.320]   I mean, what's the difference?
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.280]   It doesn't look bad.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   It's shorter.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.760]   The page is shorter.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   But interestingly, there's still no flicker on the front page.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760]   There's no delicious.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.240]   No, for not using any of these things that they bought.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.440]   They're not using any of these things they've spent millions of dollars, or it's just exactly
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.880]   the same like my Yahoo, my chat.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:09.440]   You know, I look at this Yahoo thing and it's starting to look like the old MSN.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440]   It does.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.040]   I mean, it just they all look the same with their cramp.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.040]   They got all kinds of crap.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.040]   They're just hoping to God you click on something.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:21.680]   Click on that before you leave and discuss, please click an add or two.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.680]   There's so many ads.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.920]   I mean, it's just outrageous.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.880]   I'm just so sick of them.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.240]   Well, it's unbelievable to me.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.200]   That's a totally Yahoo now has a tech channel.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.200]   Did you see that?
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.560]   They're doing a video tech channel.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.720]   Oh, it's the worst.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.040]   With Robin Raskin as she's the tech mom.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   It's just awful.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.360]   It's just a big it's just a big ad.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.840]   Yeah, it's a total ad.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.160]   I wonder if people are fooled by that.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.360]   I really wonder why people watch this stuff.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:57.280]   Well, fortunately, we are the last podcast still in the top 25 on iTunes.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.480]   So it's clearly somebody likes what we do.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480]   God only knows why.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.240]   That's because we're because we're cranky cranky.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.240]   What do you mean?
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.240]   Wait, your test might.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.000]   Sorry, you already own cranky.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   I got cranky.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   I was soing.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.280]   I was cranky before you were cranky.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280]   What do you mean?
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.480]   It's the last podcast on iTunes on the top 25 last tech podcast on the top 25.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.480]   The last tech podcast.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480]   I've fallen off the boat.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.480]   They can't keep up.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.480]   Well, no, because it's mainstream.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.720]   I think they're as good as ours.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.160]   That's the reason I think it's mainstream.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.840]   It's called going mainstream in a way.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.840]   It would have made sense that early adopters would have been more tech.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.840]   That's right.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.840]   Exactly.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.760]   And then now everybody else is doing podcast.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   Oh, it makes sense.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:43.960]   What did you see that MTV is launching a Microsoft music service called MTV-erge.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.640]   When you get the urge to download, I suppose.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.680]   But interestingly, they're doing both subscription models like Napster.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.240]   And they're also doing download like like paper, download like iTunes.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.920]   Is does anybody have this?
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.520]   I think it's going to have the same result as most urges.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.240]   And let me just use the mirror.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.640]   Does anybody have a offer?
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640]   Does anybody?
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.960]   Does anybody have a hope of beating iTunes at this point?
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.600]   Not until somebody releases like a system that's not just a piece of software.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:21.920]   A system that is a hardware thing, an operating system, and a music player, and a transcoder
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.560]   and all those things that Apple Microsoft is trying to do that.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.840]   I mean, if anybody could do it, it would be Microsoft.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:29.840]   But it's not--
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.840]   Yeah, nobody else is going to do it.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.840]   Creative is not going to beat them.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.440]   Creative only just they just sell players.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.560]   They're still stuck with Microsoft software.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.560]   So is that the key?
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.160]   Is that why iTunes is so successful?
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.040]   Because it's an OS, it's hardware, and it's the software?
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   Absolutely.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.280]   It's just top to bottom.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.280]   It's simple.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   You've got no worries.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.280]   What if somebody releases something that doesn't have DRM?
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   That's all of it.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.280]   You'll never get the content.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280]   That's all about P3.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.520]   Which by the way is not down.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.440]   I mean, it's not gone.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:03.000]   And is apparently more popular than ever based on all the publicity surrounding its downtime.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.560]   People thought it was hounded out of existence, but in fact, they just said server problems.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.560]   Wow.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.200]   Well, there's a good example.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.200]   Is it beating iTunes?
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.480]   All of MP3?
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.040]   It might be too niche to beat iTunes.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.680]   And it's already certainly beating iTunes.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.680]   Right.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.680]   But no commercial guy.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.680]   I mean, MTV.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:31.680]   Boy, I mean, if anybody-- you'd think MTV because of their association with music has
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.880]   some shot at it, but that just doesn't seem to me.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.880]   Anybody's going to leave iTunes?
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.560]   Yeah, but those people who watch MTV are not the people who are on their computers.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.280]   They're sitting around the TV stoned.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.600]   You know, watching MTV.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.840]   They probably-- that just thing sounds like a flop waiting to happen.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.400]   It strikes me the same way.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.520]   Well, they unveiled it actually back at CES.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.800]   And I thought, well, this speaks volumes about it.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.680]   They had Justin Timberlake out to wrap with Bill Gates on the stage.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.680]   And his hip.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.680]   Isn't he with it?
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.660]   And so you just thought, well, the combination of Bill Gates and Justin Timberlake is not
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.400]   going to sell this service to me.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:08.120]   No, you're going to-- you know, if they have done some sort of a deal with MySpace, you'd
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120]   have something.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.120]   But you know, they-- yeah.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.080]   And that's where all the music is.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.120]   Well, MySpace is selling downloads of stuff now.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   Did you see that?
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.120]   No.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.120]   Oh, sorry.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.120]   Well, it's not on the list, but they're selling--
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.720]   Now, wait a minute, John's going to yell at me.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.440]   This-- mock MySpace is now selling episodes of 24 for a Buck99.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.580]   OK, and of course, 24 is owned by Fox and Fox is owned by Newscope and MySpace is owned
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.580]   by Newscope.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.580]   There's all a bit of an--
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.580]   There's the juggernaut.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.820]   There's the one you should be worried about if your Apple is a--
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   --fying with that.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.820]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.020]   There's something that can be leveraged.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.020]   That's a synergy.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.780]   You've got MySpace, you've got all this content.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.780]   You've got Fox.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.780]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:55.380]   But there was an article recently-- actually, there's an article in Playboy of all places
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.380]   about MySpace this month.
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.100]   You know, I read it through the pictures.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.240]   So I missed that.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.440]   Which was-- well, I read it from the stories later.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.360]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:10.480]   But they were saying that MySpace is now becoming so totally last year.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.840]   And that all the teens that thought MySpace were hip are now heading off somewhere else
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   because it's becoming too--
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]   Not so.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   --you call this commercializing it too much.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.840]   Not so.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.640]   I don't think that's true because your friends are there.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:23.160]   Nobody likes AOL, but they don't leave because that's where their addresses, that's where
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160]   all their friends are.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.780]   And it's not long before something new and cooler with more of an indie vibe starts up.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.780]   And that's something--
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.780]   No, I think it's a friends' way.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.780]   Friends' journey.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.780]   I think it's a generational thing.
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:33.780]   I think the next generation will go to the next thing.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.380]   And I think you get stuck in the old mall.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.940]   I mean, people are still on live journal, but they're older.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.940]   Right.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.460]   No, I think that's exactly right because you stick with your cohort.
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:47.460]   And it's so hard to get all your friends to move to something new that they're going
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:48.820]   to keep using it.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:52.820]   Look at-- a good example of this is instant message clients.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:56.760]   We're here in the States, we use AOL in Canada as MSN.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.400]   I'm sure in Britain, it's MSN.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.000]   Yeah, that's a little bit of a change.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.400]   Because that's where all your friends are.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:06.640]   Well, one good example of that more recently for people at our age is when they started
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:14.480]   these kind of quasi-social business networking systems like LinkedIn and that one that Google
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.480]   finally invented.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.960]   There's still a bunch of these being formed, but I get invites to all these new ones.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   And I say, look, I've already joined three of these.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.960]   I'm on LinkedIn.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.960]   Done.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.720]   Do you use LinkedIn?
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.360]   I maintain an account on LinkedIn and once in a while, I still get it.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.760]   Somebody still wants me to put them on their list.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.540]   But I don't actively use it, but I check in one--
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.640]   I don't either, but I can--
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.980]   I can say, I continually get invites from LinkedIn.
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:41.820]   So it seems to be that's the one that at least grownups are using.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.820]   Friendster's gone.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:46.360]   In fact, I talked to a friend who worked at Friendster and he said that all of Friendster's
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.660]   business is in the Far East, that they've been discovered there.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.120]   And that makes sense.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   Then it's the new thing there.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.340]   So do these social sites have a future?
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.240]   Is there another MySpace waiting in the wings?
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.400]   I mean, there's Tag World.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.280]   There's a lot of clones of MySpace.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.160]   Yeah, I think they'll be increasingly around--
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:20.260]   And just like topic areas and also not topic areas, but franchises and stuff.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:25.560]   In the next version of Pokemon launch, there'll be a sort of Pokemon social network.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.400]   That's the kind of way that I see it going, I think.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.440]   Any other stories anybody has on tip of mind whether or not they're on the list?
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.440]   God, let's hope.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.560]   Now look what time it is.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.720]   Oh, you want to go?
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.720]   You're done?
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.720]   I don't know.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.720]   I mean, I'm just saying.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.720]   Let's wrap it up.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.680]   We've only-- it's about an hour long show, believe it or not.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.960]   We've got the first kid in the Pokésoft where, surely.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960]   You want to talk about that?
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960]   I don't know how to do that much about it.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.200]   I just don't know anything about it.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.700]   I know about it.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:14:00.140]   The problem is that this poker company that makes software for poker players, online poker
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:04.980]   players, hired a guy, they claim, who was a bad actor.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.100]   And he inserted a rootkit.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.460]   The company's called CheckRays.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:13.260]   The software is a rakeback calculator that you use to keep track of commissions that
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.860]   the poker sites are taking from you.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:19.660]   Inside the rakeback calculator, a rootkit and a Trojan-- I actually thought this was
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:20.660]   quite clever.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:27.280]   The way the Trojan works, it captures your passwords, sends them along to the bad guy.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:32.340]   But then the bad guy logs in with your account and plays badly, losing to his Confederates,
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:36.940]   to shills, who take all the money and then they split it later.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.220]   Wow, that's great.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.220]   Isn't that smart?
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:43.540]   It's hard for the-- it's hard for you to fend because that was your account.
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.020]   You just had a bad night.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.980]   It's like, no, it wasn't me.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:47.980]   It wasn't me.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:48.980]   Yes, it was.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:49.980]   It was your password.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:57.340]   In any event, there is-- CheckRays admits that this happened and they have a manual fix
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.060]   and it starts with deleting their rakeback calculator.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.620]   But I don't think this is the last of these.
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.620]   I think--
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.620]   I don't know.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.620]   It was amazed by the creativity of some of these people.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.220]   Isn't that clever?
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.220]   It's a lot of work, though.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.820]   I mean, they have to actually play and lose.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.060]   I mean, the only way to prevent something like that from happening to your own business
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:17.020]   is to hire somebody even smarter or as smart as the programmer to go over everything they
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:17.940]   did.
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.380]   They maintain proper documentation.
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:23.620]   If you're kind of on the low end of it, you're basically just hiring a programmer who says
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.620]   yes to you.
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.620]   You got to trust him.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:26.620]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.620]   You're leaving yourself open.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.620]   Programmers have done this for years.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.620]   They've put back doors.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:34.820]   I mean, a lot of people put time bombs in the code so that if you don't get paid or,
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:38.900]   you know, you don't get paid a support contract, the program stops working.
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.300]   It's not at all unusual.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.060]   I can't believe we've missed this one, guys.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.540]   Dell is shipping AMD.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.420]   You have for servers, right?
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:49.420]   Yeah, it's astonishing.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:53.660]   It's previously an Intel-only operation like forever.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:57.500]   And now they're saying that they're going to do servers with AMD and they've found customer
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:58.500]   demand.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.780]   Does that merely prove that Intel doesn't have the cloud it used to have or that Dell
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.780]   is?
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:07.060]   No, you know, I think Intel's always had this great relationship with Dell.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:11.780]   But I think at some point, the Dell guy said, "Look, if you guys can't catch up, we can't
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.380]   produce servers that are like second rate."
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:20.420]   But ironically, ironically, the new Intel server chip, Woodcrest, which is looking spectacular,
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.140]   is shipping out next month.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:27.140]   And so they've picked like the month before Intel is just about possibly to get the performance
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.860]   crown back to switch to AMD.
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.340]   It's like the worst time ever.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.780]   They can switch back quick enough.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.780]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:33.780]   It's what the customers want.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:37.420]   You find that they'll switch right back if they can.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:42.020]   So it's not the end of the line for the AMD and Intel and Dell.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.020]   They're still in bed.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.020]   I think so.
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.020]   With the new Intel chips, they're actually quite competitive.
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.020]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.860]   Oh, they're definitely competitive.
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:55.580]   We saw in our last week one of the new core duo chips.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.660]   It's in the MacBook.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:01.780]   And we put it on a desktop board and clocked it up to the same speed as the top-end AMD
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.660]   processor and it really booped it.
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.660]   Yeah, I think they're pretty easy.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.140]   It was majorly fast.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.140]   Thank goodness.
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:11.500]   I hear they're very hot, but we'll find out tomorrow when I sit on my laptop.
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.940]   So FedEx is delivering this to you, huh?
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.060]   From Shenzhou, China tomorrow.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:21.540]   And I've decided to take the tire day off and just use my laptop to fry bacon.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.540]   Just going to follow.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.220]   That's been the day shopping around Leo instead for like in his best-dose pad or something
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.140]   put on your laptop.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:29.140]   A cozy.

[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.980]   That's their advice.
