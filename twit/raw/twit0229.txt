[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.260]   It's time for TWIT.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.420]   This week in tech, the show that covers the week's news,
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.980]   although this week, I think we're going to cover the future
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.620]   because we have a peerless panel of Prostnognicators here.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.220]   I think I misread that last word.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.940]   Mr. Prostnognicator 1, John C. Devorak from Channel Devorak.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.940]   It's studio.
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.300]   It's studio with us today, I saw.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.940]   And dressed like somebody from the Renaissance Fair.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.940]   Exactly.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.260]   The Whack Fair.
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.940]   Precisely, saw.
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.020]   Also here with us, really glad to have her back.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.900]   We haven't seen her in a while.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.220]   Veronica Belmont from Techzilla and Core
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.420]   on the Sony platform.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.940]   Hey, Ryan.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.300]   Hello.
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.100]   Good to see you.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.220]   And sitting down the hall from her in the dining room.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.340]   No, no, you're in the dining room.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.060]   He's in the podcast studio.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.180]   Correct.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.020]   He's got the goods set up.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.020]   Ryan Block, hey, Ryan, how are you?
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.820]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.620]   From GDGT?
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.020]   Or you can call a gadget.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.540]   That's fine too.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.820]   Really?
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.300]   Are we OK with gadget?
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.860]   I'm all right with that if you're all right.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.620]   Oh, I love it.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.120]   It is.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.620]   What it is.
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.060]   It makes it a little bit easier.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.900]   I always-- you know, I still have my GDGT, my gadget
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.060]   and Cipio case on my iPhone from the party.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.540]   Hot tip.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.300]   I think we might be making some more of those soon.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.540]   Good.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.700]   Because people ask me all the time.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.460]   They say, where can I get one of those cases?
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.340]   I've been seeing them around.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.460]   Actually, one of our people went home to North Carolina.
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.380]   And somewhere deep in North Carolina,
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.140]   he saw two of them on the street.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.620]   Wow.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.300]   I was blown away.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.340]   We only had like a couple hundred of those things made.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.580]   Wow, that's great.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.060]   Welcoming somebody who's never been on tour before,
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.620]   I don't think he's ever-- I've ever met him, actually.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.700]   Robert X. Cringley from cringley.com.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.180]   Bob, it's great to have you.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.900]   Nice to be here, Leo.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.140]   I asked to have you on because you're
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.780]   known for making predictions.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.700]   And here we are beginning not only a new year,
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.220]   but at least to my way of thinking
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.260]   beginning a new decade, although I've received much email
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.580]   telling me I'm wrong.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.900]   So--
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.380]   People get really worked up over that.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.340]   Silly people.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.620]   Over what?
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.580]   Over the decade when the decade officially starts.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.820]   Oh, yeah, they do.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.660]   Who cares?
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.780]   If I did a decade beginning show on December 31, 2010,
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.700]   people would really complain.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.900]   So--
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.060]   They complained that--
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.620]   year 2000 was, of course, the thing.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.820]   Yeah, that was the whole big thing.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.900]   And oh, God, you know, it's not really
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.980]   the beginning of the decade.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.820]   The decade starts with one.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.500]   Tell the computer that.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   So anyway, so if it started in the year 2000, which
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.540]   is when we partied, then the decade we did the decade.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.060]   Right.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.580]   So there you go.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.260]   We partied 10 years ago.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.460]   And by the way, do you know that this is the first decade,
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.820]   I think, in--
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.700]   I think maybe perhaps in history.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.460]   Of course, there was no Dow Jones in the 1700s.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.780]   But we're generally speaking over any 10-year period,
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.220]   decade-wise, if you would invest $1,000
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.900]   in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, over 10 years,
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.740]   you will have a little more money.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.180]   This is the first time you actually would be down 50 bucks.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.540]   50?
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.460]   Well, 50's not bad.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.980]   950 or 950 or something like that.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.380]   Well, of course, you would have been now a lot more
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.300]   during the day.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.820]   Right.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.380]   Well, yeah, and that's also on average too, right?
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.420]   Well, it's just--
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.420]   Just if you've invested in the market as a whole,
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.260]   is it the Dow?
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.100]   Is it the Dow or the market of the whole?
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.740]   The Dow, I think, was the Dow.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.220]   Yeah, no, I think it's from the beginning of a decade
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.700]   to the beginning of the next decade.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.300]   You could probably have measured it from 1925 to 1935
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.220]   and had a bigger dip.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.220]   Because of the depression and the crash.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.420]   Yeah, I'm not so sure.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.940]   I'm not so sure.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.540]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.260]   Because in 1925, the real run-up that caused the crash
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.380]   really took place from about middle of 1929
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.140]   to just the beginning of 1930.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.100]   And that thing really ran up 300, over 300%.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.940]   The Dow Jones went up in that one small period.
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.940]   So in 1925, I believe the market was pretty low.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.580]   So it made me not.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.180]   Except--
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.140]   Except Black Wednesday was in October of '29.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.740]   John, what about--
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.060]   Are we on the Planet Money show here?
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.780]   Here's another one.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.260]   I think so.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.700]   I think if you went from 1923 to 1933,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.900]   I think you might be-- it's possible.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.060]   Look, John is just looking back at his youth
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.060]   and these things--
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.060]   How would I was a kid?
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.540]   --as he had an employee?
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.060]   When I was a kid--
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.860]   Money was worth something.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.340]   We used stones for money.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.700]   Dinosaurs on the Earth.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.780]   So is there something to be gained from this observation
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.420]   that the last 10 years have been crapped?
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.180]   You're just fooling around knobs and buttons.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.700]   I am.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.180]   This is the knob and button period of the show,
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.540]   where I actually don't do anything.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.700]   And John and I just kind of fool around.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.380]   Kibbutz.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.220]   Bob, what you been up to these days?
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.500]   cringley.com is the blog.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.860]   You doing any TV shows?
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.620]   I love to read it.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.580]   I write it.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.740]   A few people read it.
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.700]   I was at PBS for 11 years, left there about a year ago,
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.460]   and tried to carry my audience with me.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.340]   And I managed to do that.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.660]   I've got my numbers back where they were before.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.620]   That's great.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.780]   And I do that.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.940]   I do a little one for, believe it or not, the new AOL.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.860]   And--
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.620]   I saw that.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.500]   I thought that was funny.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.420]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.700]   Well, we like AOL.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.340]   They provide bandwidth for this show, so I'm not--
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.540]   Oh, we got AOL.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.660]   I am not going to complain.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.740]   They provide revenue for my children.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.700]   Well--
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.300]   And to be honest, AOL, the new AOL
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.020]   is really stuff like Engadget, which Ryan,
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.780]   you were involved in starting.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.540]   And that's a huge property.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.180]   Yeah, it's been a little over a year since I left AOL.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.740]   But I miss it from time to time.
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.580]   We'll have to trade some more stories.
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.180]   And it really is the new AOL.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.100]   It's very different.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.940]   They're new.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.340]   It feels like a very different company.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.860]   Everybody who I know is still there
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.140]   is I think they're having a very different experience nowadays.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.580]   I mean, when I was there, it was still the Rondi days.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.140]   And nobody liked Ron or Randy.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.620]   And I really think that Tim Armstrong is kind of given
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.140]   the company a shot in the arm.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.500]   And maybe an opportunity to write a whole lot of wrongs
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.740]   that have happened AOL in the last 10 years.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.780]   But we'll see.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.100]   They've only been spun out of time
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.580]   Warner for a little while.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.260]   Tim has only been there for less than a year.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.580]   So I think bringing on people like Robert and they
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.460]   got Saul Hansel from the New York Times too.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.300]   These are some really, really great people.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.300]   They got Saul Hansel.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.820]   When there, he left the Times?
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.180]   He did.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.980]   He did.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.820]   That was announced a couple weeks ago, I think.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.820]   Huh.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.260]   He's good.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.300]   I always thought he was a very good reporter.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.300]   That's interesting.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.660]   So let's talk about the year, shall we?
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.660]   And the decade ahead, we do know some things that
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.660]   are going to happen.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.900]   Starting Tuesday, January 5th, Google's going to make some
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.740]   sort of announcement.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.700]   And Ryan, I think it seems pretty clear this is going to be
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.020]   the Nexus one, the Google phone.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.580]   Yes?
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.420]   Yeah, I'm going to be there.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.700]   We're going to be covering it live.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.060]   But if it's anything more than the Nexus one,
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.180]   I think I'll be surprised.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.700]   It's looking pretty much like it's just going to be the Nexus
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.420]   one announcement.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.180]   Really interesting timing being that everybody has kind of
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.980]   planned their CES for the last year.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.660]   And then all of a sudden, two weeks before Google announces,
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.100]   they're going to have this little press conference.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.700]   And everybody has to rearrange their schedules.
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.460]   Were you going to be going down Tuesday?
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.580]   At least they didn't make it Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.260]   Yeah, I was actually-- I planned on going down Wednesday.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.420]   So it wasn't a big deal for me.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.860]   But a lot of my friends in the industry have had a really
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.100]   difficult time reshuffling their schedules because everybody
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.900]   is-- if they booked a flight to be in Vegas on Tuesday, then
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.620]   now they have to re-book everything and then go out to
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.900]   California.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.820]   How big a deal is the Google phone?
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.140]   Is this important?
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.700]   I mean, Google-- I mean, they're going to sell it themselves,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.500]   but they're going to service it through T-Mobile.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.820]   So it's kind of not that different.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.580]   That's another phone.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.540]   It's just another phone.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.500]   I mean, they don't have to remember that.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.740]   They've done this before.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.020]   They sold the Android-- the first Android phone, the G1,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.260]   as the Android developer phone won.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.580]   I think it was what it was called.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.860]   And so they sold it themselves as their kind of developer
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.940]   platform phone, their kind of flagship device for building
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.140]   Android apps.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.300]   And if you needed some hardware and you didn't live in the US
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.260]   to get a T-Mobile device.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.820]   So this is not impressive.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.540]   Would it have been a bigger deal if they had sold this
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.420]   completely unlocked and compatible with not only T-Mobile
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.580]   but AT&T and other GSM carriers?
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.940]   Well, I think they would.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.660]   Is that what you want, Veronica?
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.700]   I would have loved to see that, definitely, because I'm on AT&T
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.100]   right now.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.500]   And while I'm not in love with the service completely, I would
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.660]   like to be able to try the Nexus One, at least beyond
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.820]   having just a review unit, which hopefully we'll get in
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.820]   the house.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.980]   Well, it would be a shock to Apple.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.180]   I mean, it would be a real shot across their bow to say, hey,
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.100]   if you're an Apple iPhone user, just take the SIM out and
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.860]   put it in the G1, whatever it's next to one.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.900]   Well, unlock is going to be what?
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.580]   Probably around $600.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.940]   Yeah, it's a lot of money.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.740]   $19.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.780]   But that's an unlocked smartphone.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.940]   That's pretty much how much all unlocked smartphones go for.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.980]   And they are going to sell it unlocked, I guess, through
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.340]   the website.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.540]   Very similar to the way they did with the G1.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.140]   But yeah, I think what would be really interesting is if this
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.900]   had the bands necessary to run on AT&T.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.020]   It does not, as far as we know right now.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.620]   I mean, they could pull some rabbit out of their head or--
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.220]   Yeah, we should say everything is speculation.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.020]   You don't have one, do you, Ryan?
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.180]   I mean--
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.620]   I don't have one, but I've played with it.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.380]   And I know people who have one.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.580]   And it does not have AT&T 3G.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.420]   We've seen a lot of video of it.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.100]   It looks like it's super fast.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.780]   It's very fast.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.660]   It's very thin.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.500]   Are you playing with the two Veronica?
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.860]   It's super fast and the screen is unbelievably gorgeous.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.620]   Better than the droid.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.540]   Yes.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.460]   Wow, because a droid is a better screen than the iPhone.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.460]   The droids are a very nice screen.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.220]   Apple is going to refresh--
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.540]   Yeah, you can see the tiniest little pixels on there.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.140]   It's very cool.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.140]   What's going to refresh their screen?
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.020]   Well, in fact, Apple may do it sooner than later.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.220]   The rumor, of course, when we talked about this last week,
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.940]   is that January 26th, they reserved a Urbobwainis Center
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.100]   for some announcement.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.780]   Any speculation, Bob, do you know anything?
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.420]   Any-- what could they possibly be announcing
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.620]   on January 26th?
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.420]   It could be a new iPhone.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.100]   Well, the speculation is that this is the long-promised
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.740]   and ever-delayed tablet.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.940]   And I don't doubt that that's part of it.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.820]   I think there'll be more than that.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.620]   One thing to remember is that Apple always does January
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.300]   events.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.060]   So that's not unusual.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.220]   And they'll have several products,
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.820]   and they'll pull something out at the end,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.300]   and it's probably this tablet.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.380]   I don't think we have a special reason
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.660]   to believe that these rumors are incorrect.
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.500]   It's about time.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.660]   It hasn't been three or four times
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.460]   that they've almost introduced this thing.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.860]   Somebody said that this will be Steve Jobs' last one more thing.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.860]   That this is--
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.060]   I don't know.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.740]   I would someone know to say that.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.500]   Right.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.780]   Yeah, that seems a little speculative.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.980]   But I think the interesting thing to remember here
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.260]   is if this does turn out to be true,
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.340]   and they do do an event in January,
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.140]   what makes this different is that traditionally,
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.580]   their January product launches have happened at Macworld.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.460]   And they're no longer attending Macworld.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.340]   They're no longer exhibiting at Macworld.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.100]   Macworld is no longer a part of their product launch strategy.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.220]   And it's moved to February.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.620]   It wasn't last year either.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.620]   Which changes the--
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.460]   So yeah, so this would be the first time
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.460]   that they would be launching a product in this time frame,
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.300]   in the first quarter right around CES Macworld time frame
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.020]   that was not--
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.500]   It's kind of sad because, I mean, one of the things
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.100]   they said they left Macworld is they didn't
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.940]   want the pressure of announcing something in January.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.540]   I'm sure Macworld would have gladly moved in two weeks.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.660]   It's very expensive for them to go to Macworld
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.740]   and to have to make their announcements right at that time
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.260]   as well.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.340]   Right, the most possible high tech company
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.140]   in the whole country, the only guys making any money
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.700]   and it's too expensive for them.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.020]   To me, as an Apple fan and part of the Apple community,
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.660]   it seems a real diss to the community to abandon Macworld,
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.780]   to be honest with you.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.100]   And if that's why they did it, that's
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.700]   pretty scrooge-like.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.380]   Well, a little bit--
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.700]   I was saying they just say yes to you.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.460]   Were you?
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.460]   It does cost them tens of millions of dollars in some cases
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.500]   to go to Macworld to set up that--
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.100]   So what?
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.620]   --the magic--
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.460]   --that it makes you feel like they just
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.580]   don't give a crap, you know?
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.580]   And I guess they don't have to anymore.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.020]   Do you want to--
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.220]   More important than that, though, is control.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.060]   We all know that Apple is obsessed with control
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.740]   and they don't control Macworld.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.860]   At Macworld, they are an exhibitor.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.100]   Now, granted, they are like the exhibitor,
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.500]   but they are still an exhibitor.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.300]   They don't control Macworld.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.780]   They love to control their events.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.140]   They love to control everything.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:26.660]   They're control.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.780]   So I think for them, it's about control.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.780]   But you don't think they have some kind of control--
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.580]   When they want to do it, how they want to do it.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.780]   The Macworld people.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.340]   They had control over that keynote.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.420]   They had absolute control.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.180]   It was no difference.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.100]   I know they didn't--
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.060]   They don't control who gets into the Macworld.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.860]   Macworld attendees get in.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.460]   They don't control the list on that.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.420]   They control A-list, but anybody who is at Macworld
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.180]   and who can get in through Macworld gets into that keynote.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.740]   Got your invite to January 26th yet?
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.260]   Was that?
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.660]   Do you got the invite to January 26th yet?
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.580]   I think we'll know when they go out.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.620]   Yeah, I think we'll hear about it.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.220]   There were no--
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.060]   So I'm trying to figure out who wants a tablet.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.140]   Does anyone here today?
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.460]   Now, I'm glad you say that, Veronica.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.380]   You don't want a tablet.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.980]   I'm the one guy on Macbreak Weekly who keeps saying,
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.060]   eh, I don't know about a tablet.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.140]   I'm kind of about it.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.300]   I'm not really sure what I've been using it for.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.340]   A different question here.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.700]   And that is, what do they mean by a tablet?
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.220]   Remember what--
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.380]   What would you like to see, Bob?
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.300]   What would you like to see?
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.340]   Tablet used to mean pen computing.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.420]   Who talks about pen computing anymore?
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:22.900]   Nobody.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.820]   I have a tablet right here.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.820]   It's called a Newton.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.380]   There you go.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.380]   But by the way, they're going to call the new Apple
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.700]   tablet the Newton 2.
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   Newton 2.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.220]   That'd be great.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.620]   You know, the Newton was a great product.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.020]   Of course, it was way ahead of its time.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.420]   And it never went anywhere.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.740]   What are you looking at me like that?
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.980]   Look at you with the Newton in it.
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.580]   John's making fun of me and my Newton.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.420]   There's an incredibly rabid Newton fan base still to this day.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.740]   I guess it was 2010 or 2009.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.740]   The dates changed over.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.180]   The Newton was like 2012.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.060]   The Newton could not compute dates past a certain year.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.980]   And the Newton fan base has all freaked out about this
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.580]   because their newtons would stop working out.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.220]   I think it was the last year of this year.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.060]   Or it would have been.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.060]   There's a few points.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.060]   You would know better than I was.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.500]   They shipped a firmware fix.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.300]   Oh, really?
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.700]   There are a user written firmware base.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.420]   And there are newtons running Apache, running web servers.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.060]   I should fire this.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.980]   It's just a very--
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.340]   So to get back to the tablet, though,
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.860]   it's like a very niche audience.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:21.900]   And I'm just not sure.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.980]   I'm sure technologically, whatever they do is going to be
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.460]   awesome.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.620]   I'm sure it'll be great.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.300]   I'm sure it'll all be very stunned by how it works.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.580]   But day to day, I'm just not seeing a need for it.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.380]   For myself, I mean, it's a lot of other than to probably use it.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.740]   It is that they are--
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.180]   they always make an advance on the UI side.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.620]   And I think what we're going to see
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.020]   is something surprising on the user interface.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.340]   That's not a pen and it's not a touch and it's not a voice.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.500]   And it's all of those combined somehow.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.420]   Who knows?
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:56.780]   But we'll see a pretty screen, a very thin box, and a new UI
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.660]   twist.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.420]   And they won't give a damn if the volumes are low
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.820]   because they're going to have troubles.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.740]   So it's--
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.820]   It's interesting that you say that to Robert, because this
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.020]   kind of gets back to one of these conundrums that I think
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.580]   that the tablet device has.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.900]   And that is, what platform does it run?
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.460]   Does it run OS X or does it run the iPhone platform
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.900]   in much higher resolution?
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.400]   iPhone.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.180]   Let's say it looks like this, right?
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.500]   Like he's holding up a Newton.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.300]   The Newton.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.260]   Now, here's what I'm thinking.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.540]   How do you get this thing open?
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.100]   You push this?
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.580]   OK, so you got a little thing here.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.740]   And this is what you're going to see people using it with.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.800]   They're going to be like this.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.860]   Hello, mom.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.540]   Yeah, no, I'm not my new iPad.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.780]   Is the tablet-- it's not going to be a phone.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.100]   It's going to have a phone in it.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.220]   Yeah, no, it's got a phone in it.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.580]   I'm talking to you now from the phone.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.580]   Because it would be-- do we write it?
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.020]   It looks kind of cool, don't you think?
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.820]   It'd be dorky to have it.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.780]   Here, I'm putting batteries in.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.000]   You can turn it on and you can play it.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.640]   When has dorky stopped us before?
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.480]   No, it stopped me.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.280]   I will buy whatever Apple puts out,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.440]   because I'm just that kind of guy.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.080]   Well, it comes with a Bluetooth.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.560]   Look, it'll come-- OK, Bob--
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.640]   --and the shelves.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.960]   What would you design us for us?
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.840]   If you wanted to make a successful product based on a tablet,
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.640]   what would you do?
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.800]   I think just what I said, it runs the iPhone.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.760]   It probably has a gigahertz processor.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.640]   It has a prettier big screen.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.340]   They have some way of running movies on it elegantly.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.060]   It has a new UI thing where you use Jeffsters,
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.780]   or you spit on it, or something.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.300]   And then--
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.500]   That's what the New York Times said.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.100]   The New York Times quoted an Apple insider
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.700]   who said, "The user interface is not like anything
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.220]   you've seen before, and it's going to blow your mind."
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.700]   Blow your mind, they say.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.540]   And they have content deals.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.500]   So this thing--
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.660]   Well, do they-- now wait a minute.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.140]   Do they--
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.060]   --content deals, that's interesting.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.060]   Do they have content deals?
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.140]   We've heard a couple of rumors that they were talking
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:46.980]   to a publisher.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.740]   New York Times already said that they were going to do something.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.140]   But if they were talking to Random House or some other publisher,
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.260]   I'll show you how to use it, John.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.900]   You just need a little hand working with it.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.180]   Oh, before we get into the content, though, I mean,
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.420]   if we are assuming that it's going
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.780]   to have this revolutionary new user interface,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.140]   then it's not going to be running the iPhone OS.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.100]   So that implies a third platform for people to develop.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.600]   Four.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.100]   Four.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.260]   You have the server.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.180]   You have OS 10.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.540]   You have iPhone, and you have the--
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.940]   Apple's told people to start thinking big apps
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.660]   using iPhone.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.500]   Yes, that's true.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.300]   That was another one.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.740]   I mean, there's been the same operating system.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.900]   It makes more logical sense.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.580]   Then I got to do another operating system.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.700]   Yeah, it's hard for me to see them doing another OS,
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.940]   especially another kind of mobile-oriented OS.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.220]   I mean, it seems like it either needs
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.220]   to be a very mobile-centric version of OS 10,
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.340]   something that works better in a tablet form factor,
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:44.940]   or it needs to be kind of enlarged version of iPhone OS.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.940]   Is it going to be a reader?
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.500]   Is it going to be a Kindle killer?
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:47.940]   That would be--
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.940]   That's what--
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.220]   I think that's going to depend on the screen.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.660]   I mean, the reason to buy a Kindle is the eink display.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.100]   And if you have a display that's even better and more
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.220]   versatile, like a Pixel-Chee display, which is incredibly
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.420]   low power, but color, and could actually serve as a substitute
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.940]   for eink, in any cases.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.940]   But yeah, it could be--
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.500]   Newton, by the way, ladies and gentlemen--
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.340]   You broke it.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:08.940]   You broke my name.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.440]   Dead.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.460]   No, it's not dead.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.060]   The screen, the touchscreen no longer works.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.860]   Yeah, it works.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.380]   And it works fine.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.220]   Activating packages.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:23.020]   I was at eink 18 months ago, and they showed me a color eink
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.180]   display running full-motion video.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.860]   Ooh, we need that.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.940]   And that was a key-motion video, which is about a lifetime
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.380]   for it to become a product.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.140]   I think that there are a few Japanese companies that
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.380]   have had color electrophoretic displays.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.340]   And there are even some devices out in Japan
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.340]   that do that as well.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.380]   But they're incredibly expensive.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.980]   The video refresh rate is still very slow.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.860]   What's wrong?
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.700]   The only reason you use eink is for the battery life.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.500]   What's wrong with having an OLED display,
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.700]   and I have to charge it every night?
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.700]   And it's gorgeous.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.060]   It's not as much as for the battery life.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.700]   That's a smooth.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.220]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.700]   The way else we want eink.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.540]   Because it looks like paper.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.540]   Because it's easier on your eyes.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.100]   There's no need for better charge ratio.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.780]   It sounds like the dolly feeler talking at once.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.860]   To me, it would be better.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.660]   I would rather read on a big iPhone or a laptop
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.620]   than I would on my Kindle.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.380]   Would you not Veronica?
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.140]   Say it again.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.500]   Would you not rather read on your laptop or a big iPhone
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   than on your Kindle?
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.140]   No.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.980]   You like the Kindle?
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.420]   You like that black on Bray?
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.820]   I just like to go every day.
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.540]   Absolutely.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.620]   It's much easier on your eyes.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:25.980]   You take that con.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.380]   You're staring at my phone or the screen
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.620]   for four hours at a time.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.940]   I read everything on a laptop.
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.020]   I have a Kindle and I read on it at night.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.700]   Keep the camera on this.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.860]   This is some of your old stuff on here, Leo.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.940]   You're probably on there, John.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.580]   This is the Newton.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.940]   I like cheese.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.140]   I like cheese.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.060]   I like cheese.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.660]   Cheese is.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.380]   Stop it.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.380]   You wrote that.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.540]   I like cheese too.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.300]   Cheese is good.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:48.820]   For small mates.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.100]   I'm just seeing if it recognized the word.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.900]   So it's an e-book reader, but it doesn't have e-ink.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.060]   And you think that if, Bob, you think
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.300]   if it were an e-ink display were to come along, say,
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.220]   from Amazon that had full motion and color
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.020]   that it would be better?
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.260]   That's what we want.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:05.740]   Of course.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.500]   It expands the data types that it can present.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.580]   You'll pay more for a movie than you'll pay for something else.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.900]   It's costly, though, right, Ryan?
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.740]   That's the reason that's the objection you're giving
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.700]   is too expensive.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.220]   It's costly.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.340]   And it's-- I mean, even regular e-ink is not
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.860]   quite there technologically yet.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.380]   So we're still years away from color e-ink that's
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.940]   going to do something like full motion video.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.020]   We may never get there.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.140]   It may be advances in LCD-based displays that get us--
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.420]   But Bob says he saw it 15 months ago.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.380]   I'm sure you saw it.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.860]   And like I said, there are displays and devices
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.460]   like this in Japan already.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.460]   But again, are incredibly expensive.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.620]   They're very hard to manufacture.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.460]   And they just don't refresh fast enough in most cases.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.860]   Veronica Belmont, I would like to ask you a question.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.700]   You have on this thing.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.700]   Do you really believe that e-ink is better and easier
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.580]   to read than a laptop screen?
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.500]   I find that hard to believe, young lady.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.780]   Yes.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.460]   Yes.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.980]   Is it maybe that I'm old, John, you're old?
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.180]   Huh?
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.100]   What do you think?
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:07.940]   What?
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.540]   I don't think that the Kindle is that easy to read.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.500]   I know it's more solid.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.060]   I think it's very easy to read.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.980]   It's easy to read.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.420]   Easy to read.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.580]   But I would prefer to read a laptop.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.260]   Because I want color.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:16.780]   I want motion.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.620]   Well, Leo, maybe you just need to make the text bigger.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.820]   I know your eyes are probably not what they used to be.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.740]   Big giant text.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.420]   You can do that on a Kindle.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.780]   You know you can make it that bigger.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.060]   I made it all the biggest to the--
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.140]   So you've got it written on here.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.060]   I love Obama.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:29.620]   Give me that.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.940]   You can do this thing to this thing.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.740]   I wrote that in 2000.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.460]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.300]   I love Obama.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:35.660]   You're making that.
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.260]   Look at you.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.180]   She's making that up.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:37.700]   There's no one.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.380]   You need this fancy pen.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.940]   You do need a stylus on this thing.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.220]   There's a lot of reasons why this didn't make it.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.660]   And chiefly because it's black on gray.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.020]   You keep black on gray.
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.580]   It's like black on black.
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.300]   You can't see it.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.100]   It seems like that funny quasi-green color.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.900]   With kind of a horrible contrast.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.060]   The contrast.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.900]   You just look to it.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.140]   Well, they didn't have--
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.580]   They didn't have--
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.140]   It was a head of the sun.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.100]   --at the matrix at the time.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.380]   This was a passive matrix.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.580]   This is way out of its time.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.420]   Way out of the technology.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.420]   So that seems--
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.420]   The idea was--
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.860]   Who's going to disagree with me in Veronica?
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.540]   Our position is that the world doesn't want a tablet.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.020]   Napole is chasing up the wrong tree.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.540]   You agree?
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.300]   Am I misstating your point of view, Veronica?
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.740]   No, I thought you were going to see
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.300]   who agreed with the E-incovert reading the laptop.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:22.980]   No, no, no.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.580]   No, I'm done with that.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.740]   He's had it with that argument.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.340]   I gave up on that.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.780]   Do you agree, John, that the tablet is a bum idea?
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.460]   No, I don't.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.060]   I think the possibility exists that this will
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.940]   be the decade of the tablet.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.780]   Bob, you agree?
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.780]   The decade of the tablet.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.420]   I think they're not going to pitch it as a tablet per se.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.540]   I think that they're going to find a different spin on it
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.420]   and find a way to make us like it.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.300]   So yeah, I think a lot of people are going to buy them.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.780]   That's interesting because the world is expecting a tablet.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.740]   So there's a little risk in saying, well, it's not a tablet.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.500]   It's fine.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.820]   So the Kindle's not a tablet either.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.220]   Ryan, what do you think?
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.780]   Yeah, I'm with Robert.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.780]   I think that it's going to be a different spin on it.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.100]   I mean, tablets have not been successful to date.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.220]   Tablets are not something that people got in shop for
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.340]   or desire and--
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.980]   By the way, I wrote a column in PC Mago at this.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.300]   I blame Microsoft for the whole fiasco aspect of this.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.060]   They were the ones--
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.220]   It's entirely possible that they're
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.300]   responsible for tablets not having taken off the way
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:23.900]   that we all kind of call it.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.020]   Because they made the crappy tablet, the UMPC.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.860]   They made three or four iterations of this.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.300]   And Microsoft-- and then the fractal here
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.660]   is Microsoft was also the one who killed the smartphone business
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.260]   until Apple came along.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.140]   They were running that.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.820]   And then into the ground, nobody cared.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.420]   Because they did-- their model, their ability to change
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.260]   the way you look at these things is impossible.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.940]   So can Apple--
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.700]   Well, I want to know what kind of spin you think--
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.700]   Yeah, that's what I think they're referring to the
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.420]   conversation.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.780]   Yeah, what's the spin that makes it better?
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.740]   Because I can see a larger multimedia device,
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.740]   like a large touch, for example, which I could use around
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.180]   the house.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.380]   But I wouldn't want to take with me on a trip because it
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.060]   would be too hard to type out a bunch of emails
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.300]   on a touchscreen interface.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.300]   I mean, I can do that on my iPhone, but I don't love to.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.420]   I just want to know what spin you think they could add to it
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.820]   that would make it more mass marketable.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.060]   Well, one thing they could do is they could make it a different
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.580]   enough device that they can break the deal with AT&T
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.420]   and have it come out as a subsidized Verizon device.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.140]   Has to be always on the internet, right?
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.180]   Has to have 3G.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.380]   Can't just be a Wi-Fi device.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:27.620]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.100]   Wow.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.620]   It could.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.060]   There's a problem because I already have.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.020]   I'm already paying for my iPhone.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.660]   I'm already paying for--
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.100]   What if you pull out your little card and put it into this
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.140]   thing and you've still got the same account with AT&T?
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.180]   Would that bother you?
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.340]   It's hard to pull that card out.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.340]   Nobody's going to do that.
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.340]   Yeah, that's not easy.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.620]   That's a non-starter.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.620]   Maybe they come up with a toolkit.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.940]   I think you're going to kill it.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.780]   You make me pay for $60 a month.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.380]   For additional network access that I already have paid for at
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.580]   home and on my phone, a third connection.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.580]   That's a fine thing.
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.900]   They finally have tethering.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.340]   Oh, they'd have to allow tethering.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:00.860]   That's easy.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.380]   Good.
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.940]   Well, that's AT&T doesn't like that idea.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.300]   Yeah, why would AT&T, unless Apple could say to AT&T, we're
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.620]   leaving you unless?
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.460]   Because it's not in their interest to provide tethering.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.380]   Right.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.380]   So how do you solve that?
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:13.900]   How do you solve that?
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.900]   How do you solve that?
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.740]   I'm inevitably.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.700]   Well, yeah, this year, apparently.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.700]   Yeah, AT&T would probably implode at that point.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.220]   At that point.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.820]   It would be insane to extend that deal.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.420]   So then you're stuck with a tablet that either has an
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.060]   expensive 3G connection that nobody wants to pay for because
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.620]   they already have two others or has no 3G and is completely
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:33.140]   worthless.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.820]   Now what do you do?
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.140]   They kind of solve that.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.860]   Also, there exists a possibility that it's optional and
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:44.260]   that you can buy the tablet with the 3G module based on the
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.260]   service that you want, kind of like how you buy laptops that
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.340]   have 3G modules based on the service that you want.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:49.780]   One word.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.820]   You might get one with AT&T, you might get one with Verizon.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.860]   I don't think it's got-- it doesn't have to be either or.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.420]   They do a deal with Amazon and it's Whispernet.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.980]   Whispernet.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.460]   No, Whispernet's AT&T.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.300]   I thought it was Sprint 2, but it's AT&T.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.340]   No, well, it is on the new device, on the original device.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.180]   Oh, the older one of Sprint, OK.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.620]   So they could do-- if they have a lot of content deals, they
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.900]   could do a Kindle-like.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.500]   Why don't they do the ultimate content deal and partner with
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   Amazon?
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.340]   I don't think Amazon is the front.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.740]   Because I think stops and those both have such a need to
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.500]   control.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.460]   Ego.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.260]   They would kill each other.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.580]   Ego would stop them.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.020]   But wouldn't that be a good play?
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.460]   You say, look, you suddenly have access to 650,000 books.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.820]   The Kindle-- this is the Kindle 3 kind of.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.980]   Well, if they did a licensing deal, I could see it working
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.100]   because Amazon would be selling books anyway.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.260]   And you use Whispernet.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.420]   And, you know, essentially--
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.260]   I mean, the model should be for any of these devices.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.780]   But why would Amazon want people to buy this device over
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.460]   whatever new version of the Kindle they could buy?
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.540]   Because they would, because the device is not what Amazon's
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.060]   interested in.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.580]   The Amazon's interested in selling books.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.580]   This is a razor blade scheme.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.820]   They have no interest in being in the Kindle business.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.940]   I would submit.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.340]   It's a razor blade scheme.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.780]   You sell a product-- you have your product, or even a
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.700]   Nintendo scheme, where you have this deal, this device,
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.500]   and then you sell games into it.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.540]   So Amazon sells books.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.540]   They're selling enough kindles that I think they would
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.500]   want to continue, at least making the margin off of those.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.740]   No one knows.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.540]   We can also back in conversation.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.460]   Because Amazon has already done this.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.220]   Kindle lives on the iPhone platform.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.860]   It would not take much for them to be able to enable
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.980]   purchasing of eBooks on the Kindle iPhone app.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.140]   So assuming this device runs the iPhone platform, then
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.260]   they're already there.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.940]   They don't have to do a content partnership.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.620]   Apple doesn't have to do a content partnership.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.460]   They're already there.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.300]   I'm trying to solve the play of the app side.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.740]   I'm trying to solve the network, the wireless access.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.580]   He's trying to decide whether he wants one.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.180]   No, I want one.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.060]   You know, I'm in line to buy it.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.940]   I don't care if Steve says buy it, I'm buying it.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:52.300]   I don't care.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:52.780]   That's true.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.580]   You lockstep.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.660]   You force.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.660]   Of course.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.500]   Come on, you're buying one, and you're buying one, and you,
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.460]   and you're buying one.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.060]   So I--
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.260]   Me.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.260]   Huh?
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.900]   You're not going to buy one, Bob?
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.700]   You're not in line?
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.700]   Not right away, no.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.540]   Not right away.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.060]   What does that mean?
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.860]   Two, you buy it Wednesday instead.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.700]   So they get second iteration and--
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.420]   Second iteration.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.380]   I have a Kindle one.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.420]   I have a Kindle two.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.420]   I'm walking around the show off thing.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.540]   Yeah, maybe you have me to stewardess.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.620]   You know, that's about all you're going to get.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.500]   My first iPhone was a 3G.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.420]   Really?
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.540]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.660]   I'm impressed.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.340]   What did you have before that?
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.460]   A razor.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.300]   Oh, now I'm under--
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.900]   Well, that's really old.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.100]   I have a few rangers that actually work on.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.500]   Now I'm really depressed.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.740]   There's no reason to have to keep up with this stuff.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.540]   We're going to take a break.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.380]   We're going to come back.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.380]   I still want to hear your predictions for 2000--
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.900]   I'm sorry, 2010.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.940]   We're not supposed to call it 2010.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.540]   No.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.540]   Oh, no, I'll talk about that too.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.060]   And more with us, John C. Devorak from Channel Devorak
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.300]   from Tekzilla, it's Veronica Belmont,
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.980]   Ryan Block from Gadget, and Robert X.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.740]   Cringley from cringley.com.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.420]   And of course, we're going down to CES in two days, three days.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.300]   You're going to CES this year?
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:08.820]   No.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.060]   Yeah, you always say that.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.820]   But then you show up.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.340]   No.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.540]   I'm not really going to make up.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.020]   Really, really, really not.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.260]   Really, really, really not.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:15.420]   Brian, you're going.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.500]   You're going to be down there.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.220]   Oh, I will be there.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.460]   We're going to come by and help us.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.140]   We're launching some new stuff on Gadget specifically for CES.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.060]   Well, please come by.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.300]   And Veronica, you'll be there with Tekzilla, I know.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.700]   I will.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.500]   Yep.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.540]   Robert, you going to CES this year?
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.540]   Absolutely not.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.980]   See, the old guys say God here.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.740]   I've been there.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.180]   I'm jealous.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.580]   But Joe has not changed for five years.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.940]   Well, good because I haven't been there for six.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.980]   So I'm excited.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.820]   It'll be new for me.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.300]   You've still had my convex, too.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.260]   I have a-- oh, if they brought back convex,
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.860]   I would be so in.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.420]   PC Expo.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.260]   No, I--
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.260]   No, I'm just joking.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.420]   Well, that's an old reference.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.340]   Just joking.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.580]   You're some Jack Benny material.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.380]   I haven't been at CES since 2004.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.380]   It's been six years.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:54.740]   Really?
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.620]   And I thought it was time.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.460]   One of the reasons was because of the overlap between that
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:57.980]   and Macworld.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.180]   And I always said, well, I'm here.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.540]   I'll just do Macworld.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.100]   But we're going to go down with 10 people.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.820]   All our cameras are all our gear, all our equipment.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.260]   And--
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.780]   And I can vouch for this.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.100]   You've got some wild--
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.620]   Have you got any other room?
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.060]   This guy is unbelievable.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.940]   This guy's taking the money he's making on this show
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.260]   and putting it into gear.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.860]   He's got the greatest rig.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.980]   This is going to be one of the--
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.460]   this is going to make network TV people look like small potatoes
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.460]   what you're setting up.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.140]   I don't know about that.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:23.980]   Amazing.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.860]   It's very interesting what Colleen's building right now
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.780]   in the other room.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.620]   It's portable rig using four different EVDO cards
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.300]   that go in there.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.780]   You can't-- you won't believe it.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.900]   But a lot of this is off the shelf technology, for instance,
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.100]   we're going to be using sling box and a sling catcher at this end
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.620]   to send the video back to our studios where it'll be really
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.140]   under the--
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.420]   Yeah, we're doing all sorts of interesting stuff
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.900]   because we have to do this on the cheap.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.620]   I can't spend a million dollars if they--
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.260]   It looks like you've almost spent half a million.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.260]   No.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.660]   Anyway, part of this is because of the great folks at Sync
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.060]   who are making this possible.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.820]   Sync is, of course, the in-car, hands-free Bluetooth, music,
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.980]   turn-by-turn directions, information,
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.140]   get traffic information.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.340]   You can get Veronica-- this is where you can go put the blonde
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.700]   wig on, dear, if you'd like.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.060]   This--
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.500]   John just wanted out to put on his blonde wig.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.380]   I think you could do it.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.620]   It's, you know--
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.260]   Next time.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:17.940]   Next time.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.340]   All right, I'll give you-- we got one more ad.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.860]   I'll give you another shot at it.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.740]   Turn by turn-- and Bob, anything you'd like to do right now,
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.500]   this is a good time to do.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.420]   Just be our guest.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.780]   I'll turn the camera off so they can't see you anymore.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.060]   I can see you, though.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.900]   He's just sitting back.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.780]   Look, he's just relaxing.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.700]   Just putting his feet in.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.220]   Take a nap.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   It's going to be a while that we're about to do.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:37.900]   It's going to be a while.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.100]   It's a long ad.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.380]   No, we're almost through.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.820]   Sync is supporting our CES coverage.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.460]   We'll be in Vegas.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.420]   6th to the 10th, all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.140]   We're doing the parties on Wednesday and Thursday,
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.780]   all the events.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.220]   Kiki with me, Dicty Bartolo, the GizWiz Paul
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.460]   Thoreau from Windows Weekly, Ryan Shrout from this week
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.540]   in computer hardware.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.660]   The whole gang is going down.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.740]   Scott Wilkinson from our Home Theater Geeks Podcast.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.620]   So we are going to cover this every which way, but loose.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.420]   It's going to be a lot of fun using weird, creative,
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.580]   wireless technology that probably won't work.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.860]   But please tune in and see.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.300]   Live.twit.tv, the 6th to the 10th.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.500]   And if you catch me, we're driving the Lincoln down,
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.140]   the Lincoln MKT down with the sync.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.500]   If you could see, if you catch me, say hello,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.020]   and I'll give you a tour of the sync.
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.660]   This thing is amazing.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.060]   Or go to your Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury dealers
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.540]   and say I want to test drive sync.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.100]   Or visit the website.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.140]   All sync owners have a special website at syncmyride.com.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.420]   But you can go there and watch the videos
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.820]   and find out more about it.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.660]   There will be big announcements from Ford about sync
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.900]   at CES.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.820]   They've already kind of leaked some of this Wi-Fi built in,
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.500]   this HD radio tagging.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.100]   But there's more coming from Ford and sync.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.100]   And we're going to interview the CEO of Ford, I think,
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.300]   on Wednesday and on Thursday or Friday,
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.340]   we've got the chief engineer behind sync.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:04.340]   So tune in all for the rest of the week, our coverage from CES.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.980]   Syncmyride.com, we thank them for their support.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.140]   You probably know a few things, Ryan, about sync.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.500]   Have you ever used sync?
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:12.940]   I've used them anytime.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.620]   Because I love it.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.020]   I love it.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.020]   Yeah, you can rent cars now with it.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.740]   Yeah, they've actually done a really surprising job
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.340]   of getting it into so many vehicles.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.100]   When they first announced it a few years back,
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.980]   I was like, oh, we'll see how this goes.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.740]   It's the Microsoft Auto platform, which I'm not that familiar
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.020]   with, although I understand they just made a deal with--
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:37.100]   is it key somebody to do it, to put it in their cars?
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.580]   Yeah, they're still around.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.380]   I know.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.820]   I just don't know anything about cars.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.180]   Who knows who's around anymore?
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.740]   My gray zone.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:44.220]   Me too.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.300]   Well, yeah.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.540]   Microsoft is doing a better job of getting it
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.340]   in what car companies remain these days.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.340]   Brands are shutting down, left and right.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.500]   Probably making it easier for them to cut these deals.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.900]   The thing that impressed me about Ford
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.020]   is they kind of have a vision for this thing that is much more
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.980]   open than you'd expect from a car company, much more
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.220]   of a platform they want to do apps and apps store.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.780]   I mean, I think they're really kind of paying attention
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.500]   to what's going on.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.540]   And I really like-- I'm very impressed by this.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.500]   But enough about that.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.500]   And there goes--
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.500]   War I.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   He's back.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.500]   You could tell he's back.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   We're all back now.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.500]   John has this kind of internal timer.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.260]   He knows when the commercial's over.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.540]   So Veronica looks the same.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.580]   No, no, Blondwig.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.500]   Nothing.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   She just--
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.060]   Oh, wig.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.580]   She's just no fun.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.180]   She won't come on cranky geeks.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.700]   Oh, look.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.940]   No, no, no, no, stop.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:33.460]   It's OK.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.580]   Don't let him pull you into that.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.140]   She won't come on cranky geeks.
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.460]   She won't get-- we got the costume ready for it.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.540]   I don't work downtown.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.580]   I have no way of getting downtown to do cranky geeks
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.140]   during the week.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.260]   Don't worry about it, Veronica.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.780]   I tell you these things.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.820]   Of course, John, if this makes you feel any better,
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.140]   I asked her to be on the tweet last week.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.100]   And she said she couldn't.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.580]   She was going to the craft fair with her girlfriends.
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.020]   The craft fair.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.260]   And how was that craft fair?
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.780]   No, I don't do crafts.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.740]   I bought some scented candles.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.420]   And I bought a picture.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.260]   A picture?
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.580]   Now you know how bad I feel, John.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.100]   She actually stiffed you.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.100]   She stiffens the best scented candles.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.420]   I have to make plans with my lady friends,
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.980]   because we don't have a lot of free time.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.500]   It's great.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.660]   Well, with your lady friends.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:16.820]   I'm not knocking.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.620]   I wonder what they do with the candles.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.500]   Oh, you are cute.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.500]   Oh, I want them to be.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.000]   OK.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.980]   No, you put them around the back tub.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.500]   That's it.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.140]   And they said they're bouncing fast all the way.
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:25.900]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.660]   He's a horrible, horrible man.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.980]   So scented candles, John.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.900]   And you can have a nice relaxing dip in the tub.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.780]   And all your cares will just wash away.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.260]   I love candles.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:42.140]   Sorry.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.780]   I think we've got a show title.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.660]   Oh, dear brother.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.100]   Sprint.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.940]   I love cheese.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.420]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.100]   I know what to get you for your birthday.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.860]   I like cheese candles best.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.420]   Gee, let's say Obama on them.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.340]   Sprint is according to Engaget going
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:02.980]   to be introducing probably at CES a YMAX EVDO mobile hotspot.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.460]   Now, I really like the MyFi.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.740]   I've been using the MyFi for some time.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.580]   This is kind of like a MyFi only.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.780]   It's got YMAX as well as EVDO on it.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.580]   100-foot Wi-Fi range.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:20.260]   They say $50 according to Engaget.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.260]   Well, it's subsidy, yeah.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.260]   With subsidy.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.540]   Yeah, it's not how much the modem is.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.820]   It's how much the monthly fee is for the bandwidth.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:32.340]   There is a company that is doing a EVDO modem
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.300]   that they claim is unlimited.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.340]   Unfortunately, it's got a very-- what's very limited
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.340]   is their coverage.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.060]   Have you seen that?
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:43.900]   What is the name of that?
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.620]   Somebody keeps telling me about this.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.020]   It's not Magic Jack.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.580]   It's something like that.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.540]   The data jack.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.180]   Data jack.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.380]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.140]   Very good.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.300]   Have you used it?
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.020]   No, no.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:57.900]   I haven't used it.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.300]   I mean, the unlimited argument is--
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.940]   I find it kind of funny because as annoying as it is
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.020]   that these guys do cap your data at five gigs when it's
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.500]   supposed to kind of be unlimited.
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.220]   I've used EVDO for years and years.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.780]   I'm a very, very heavy EVDO user.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.940]   It's hard to get past five years.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.500]   Yeah, I've never really gotten there.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.220]   I mean, if you're doing torrents and stuff, I guess maybe.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.420]   But you wouldn't really want to be doing that on EVDO anyway.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.460]   It's so slow.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.940]   I mean, you have to really kind of go out of your way to do
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.940]   to do five gigs a month.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.340]   It's kind of very limited.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.500]   I mean, it's great in many-- if you're in Minnesota,
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.100]   you're going to be happy about these guys.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.780]   I don't know.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.260]   Are these in MVNO?
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.300]   Who are they getting?
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.300]   Look at the coverage map.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.780]   It's just weird.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.340]   I can't think of who these people are.
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.780]   They've got like the Central Valley, but not San Francisco.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.340]   Did you talk about that poor guy that was
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:51.420]   charged like $17,000 for downloading movies over EVDO?
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.540]   He exceeded the limit, I take it.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.260]   Yeah, well, he also did it from Mexico.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.180]   Oh.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:56.660]   What is that?
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.300]   That's nuts.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.300]   That's just crazy.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:58.820]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:38:59.660]   So you're international rowing--
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.460]   I think they worked it out, but that's what happens.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:02.820]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.900]   You've got to be careful with the town--
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.860]   Pay attention.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.940]   So they're using the T-Mobile network.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.420]   I don't know if it's HSDPA.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.260]   It's not EVDO.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.340]   If it's T-Mobile, it would be--
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.340]   isn't it HSDPA?
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.700]   Yeah, it doesn't say EVDO.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.620]   High-speed internet service.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.140]   You know, we just got Doxys 3 modems from Comcast.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.580]   You did?
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.020]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.620]   100 megabits down.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.300]   What?
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.900]   No, what is it?
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.740]   50 megabits down and 12 up.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.340]   I mean, it's for $100 a month.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.540]   It's amazing.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.860]   Yeah, we have it daily.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.940]   This is their response to Fios.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.860]   Now, how many areas are being served by this?
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.620]   Well, you guys--
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.100]   You're rolling it out completely.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.020]   I got Charles from South Carolina,
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.180]   where nothing happens here, and I have it here.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.940]   She do.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:45.300]   That's so--
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.860]   Just making faces.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.380]   It leaves--
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.140]   So you have it in North Carolina?
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:49.620]   South Carolina.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.620]   South Carolina.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.380]   And my telephone line was, I think,
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.260]   installed in 1776 or 1876.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.140]   Why don't you move to South Carolina?
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.740]   My wife is from here, and I like to sleep with her.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.020]   Every night?
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.460]   So why did you move to South Carolina?
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.700]   It's not answering the question.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.460]   That's where she is.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.300]   I didn't say why.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.060]   I've been to South Carolina.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:12.780]   It's a nice state.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:13.700]   It's a lovely state.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.420]   Yeah, I live in Charleston.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.220]   And Charles is the greatest city in the country.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.100]   What are you kidding me?
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:18.860]   Is it really?
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.740]   It's beautiful.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.740]   That's not Savannah, Georgia, you're talking about.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.900]   No, Savannah, Georgia is not as pretty as Charles.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.540]   Charleston, South Carolina, is more lovely than Savannah.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.500]   They're the same.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.100]   They're similar.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:29.740]   They're very similar.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.980]   It's anti-bellum kind of--
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.580]   Right, yeah.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.300]   And untouched.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.660]   In fact, when Sherman was taken to the south,
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.780]   he got to Savannah, and he was just obviously burning
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.380]   everything down.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.460]   He burned Atlanta to the ground.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.980]   He looked at Savannah, and he said, hey, we'll leave this one
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.460]   here because I might want to retire here.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.460]   And he left.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.740]   You know, the funny thing is that Sherman got to Savannah,
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.340]   and he was going to go to Charleston,
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.020]   and he went to Columbia instead because he was seasick.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.940]   I've been at Greenville at maybe--
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.020]   So along the way, Vernon, Charleston was saved.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.980]   Best restaurant in Greenville.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.300]   Everything was fried.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.020]   Everything.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.180]   And hush puppies even with dessert.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.580]   Oh, poo butter.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.780]   Hush puppies with poo butter?
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.980]   That's poo butter.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.780]   That's what I call my wife.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.740]   That is poo butter.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.780]   Is it peanut butter?
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.860]   No, it's sweet butter.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.340]   Sweet.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.260]   Oh, yeah, with poo butter.
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.020]   That's what it was.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.020]   Yeah, it was honey butter.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.020]   So it was a little too--
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.580]   Anyway, getting back to reality, we have Doxys 3
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.900]   in Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.460]   That's amazing.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:28.940]   Yes.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:29.700]   And you love it.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.820]   And now, here's the question.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:31.540]   Does it come?
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.660]   No, in Oakland, no.
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.420]   We have it in Petaluma.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.060]   You might have it.
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:36.860]   You know what?
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:37.900]   You should check.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.140]   I'm going to check with my guys in--
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.900]   Because we didn't know.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.060]   And yes, they do because Colleen has it there.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.900]   She also lives in the East Bay.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.780]   What town?
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.380]   Well, I'm in Berkeley, so I don't know.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.180]   It's very close.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.020]   They're similar.
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:50.860]   All right, I'll check that out.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.860]   So, obviously, you take a turn to the left and then you're in Berkeley.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.220]   I think I was going to stand Pablo node, which may not have--
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.380]   No, you have to get a new modem.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:56.900]   That's the thing.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:57.660]   Oh, they'll send me a--
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.300]   They send you Doxys 3 modem.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.540]   And you get on the Doxys 3 head end.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.420]   So, is it noticeably faster?
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.700]   Because the feeds are coming over slow.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.220]   I know.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.620]   A lot of the servers you're going to.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.500]   What about you, Bob?
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.100]   Do you notice the difference in speed?
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.740]   Well, I didn't get it.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.900]   It's here.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.980]   It arrived last week.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:16.900]   And I haven't got it yet.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.380]   But the funny thing is they rolled it out.
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.300]   And my speeds went up.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.860]   They're kind of upgrading everything in a sense.
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.580]   So, I just did a measure, you know, before we came on this thing
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.220]   to see whether I could support it.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.940]   And I have 12 Megs upstream, which is why we're doing this.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.180]   12 Megs up.
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.700]   Wow.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.380]   This video looks so good.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.820]   It might all test it.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.300]   Partly because some of the people who used to be on your head
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.900]   end have moved over to the other one.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.860]   I think they moved you every little bit more bandwidth.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.260]   I think here's what my theory is that they're going to Doxys 3
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.700]   everywhere, and they don't upgrade your modem unless you pay
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.380]   for the high end.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.420]   So, you might have a Doxys 1 or 2 modem.
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.660]   But it's getting some of the benefits.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.420]   Doxys 3 is only channel bonding.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.140]   That's all it is.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.540]   Oh, really?
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.380]   That's the big difference?
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.820]   Yeah.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.380]   Well, I'm--
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.620]   Yeah, we have it here.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.660]   And it is amazing.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.100]   What about the cap, though?
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.900]   What about the cap?
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.700]   I mean, you guys still have the 250 megabit cap?
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.380]   You know, I haven't run into the cap.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:07.940]   You know, I haven't--
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.420]   I'm in the counter as a cap.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:09.740]   On my machine.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.700]   It's annoying, but unless you're doing some serious, serious
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.500]   file transfer, you're not going to run into it.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.500]   I've yet to run into it.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.900]   I can't get over 50 gigabytes a month.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.900]   And I'm using the thing full time.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.900]   I don't--
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.900]   Yeah, I mean, I work from home.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.620]   I work on the internet.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:30.740]   I do nothing but use the internet almost 18 hours a day.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.820]   And we have yet to hit it.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:33.340]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.740]   You'll never--
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.820]   It's really, I think, if you're just
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.780]   like if you're downloading tons and tons of--
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.900]   You have to work hard.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.420]   I can't even imagine.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.860]   It doesn't sound like a lot when you think about it
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.860]   over a 30-day period.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.100]   But it actually is.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.460]   250 gigs is a lot.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:47.820]   What's it?
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.620]   8 gigs a day is a lot.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.460]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.620]   So but you're getting-- you're getting-- what kind of speeds
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.900]   are you getting?
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.700]   So we opted for the lowest Docsys 3 plan.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.220]   So I think we're on 30 megs by 10.
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.900]   So we get 10 megs upstream, which is actually
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.420]   how Veronica and I are--
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.860]   You're both on Skype looking great.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:05.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.900]   We're both on the same--
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.500]   No problem.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.020]   --actually right now because we just have to ban with despair.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.420]   I could probably go start up a video game,
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.820]   play what we're both playing tonight.
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:14.660]   This is to me.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.820]   You should do that.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.820]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.620]   I'll start a raid.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.780]   Download avatars.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.780]   See what happens.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.300]   Somebody in the chat room is asking how you'd monitor.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.100]   As you go on-- just go to Google and put a--
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:25.700]   Comcast--
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.540]   --bandwidth monitor.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.500]   Yeah, Comcast-- a bandwidth monitor.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.300]   And you'll get about five or six programs.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.500]   And some of them are pretty cool.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.020]   But Comcast isn't supposed to have one.
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.100]   Once they did the caps, they said, OK, we'll tell you
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:35.820]   what you're using.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:36.300]   I've seen it.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.020]   I think you have to go to--
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.500]   I use a bit.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.620]   You probably don't go to Comcast.net very often.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.980]   Do you even know about that?
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.620]   No, I don't.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.060]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.900]   I just go through the Comcast Cares guy.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.340]   And I just say, hey, can you take care of me?
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.300]   Hey, Frank, tell me--
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.300]   What are you using?
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.100]   Frank calls me out.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:49.940]   I put my bandwidth.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.940]   I'm supposed to be doing it.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.980]   John, you have people, don't you?
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.860]   Yes, he has people.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.260]   It's made of people.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.740]   Bono, the rock star.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.300]   You remember him, Bono?
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.140]   Big investor and elevation partners.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.020]   Roger McNamee's.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:02.780]   Yeah, oh, yeah.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.900]   He's not only his Bono hip with it, wearing sunglasses
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.980]   all the time, but he also has an article in the New York
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.860]   Times for January 2nd on his top 10 new ideas
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.500]   for the new decade.
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.380]   Would you like to go through some of those?
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.180]   I would love to know what Bono thinks is going to happen
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.100]   in the next decade.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.540]   He says, in the spirit of rock star excess
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.900]   I offer yet another top 10 list.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.020]   Oh, top 10 list.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.740]   The main difference, if it matters,
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.020]   is this list looks forward, not backward, which
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.420]   is I was trying to get all you guys to do.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.020]   Yeah, well, if you just would ask us--
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:36.820]   I think I did.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.700]   Where is this on here?
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.580]   I don't see it in the--
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.020]   I made it up.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:40.980]   It's not in the list.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.980]   Do you want me to put it in the list?
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.140]   I'll put it in the list right now.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:43.420]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:43.420]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:43.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.600]   Hold on.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.540]   Let me push a button.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.440]   2, 2, 9.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.260]   There it goes.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.780]   We don't do well with change, Leo.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.260]   Oh, I know.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.220]   We need to spell things out for us.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.800]   Delicious.com/twits/2, 2, 9.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.340]   It'll be right there.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.720]   He says, the main difference to my list, if it matters,
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.860]   this list looks forward, not backward.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.320]   So here, our 10 ideas that might make the next 10 years
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.780]   more interesting, healthy, or civil.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.520]   Some are trivial.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.280]   Some are fundamental.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.860]   They have little in common with one another,
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.660]   except I am seized by each.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.000]   A psychopath in this photo.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:14.440]   That's bottom.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.280]   He's seized?
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.000]   He's seized by each and moved by a financial--
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.920]   A anchor.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   To change our rules.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.520]   He's seized up.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.000]   It's funny.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.440]   It's like a big hand gripped him and moved him.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.720]   Return of the-- number one.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.440]   Return of the automobile as a sexual object.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.960]   Ow, ow.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.280]   That's-- what?
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.960]   I think you nailed it with that one.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.000]   How is it the country that made us all fall in love
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.040]   with the automobile has failed with only a few exceptions
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.720]   to produce a single family sedan with-- oh,
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.780]   I could just see Bono in a single family sedan.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.820]   With a style humor and grace of the cars producing
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.380]   the 40s, 50s, and 60s.
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.100]   OK, this is another craft--
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.620]   No, this is good.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:51.980]   Look it.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.780]   He says, get Steve Jobs and Johnny Ive, Frank Geary,
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:56.740]   Jeff Coons--
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.940]   Frank Geary, you'd have a blob car.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.300]   Oh, come on.
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.180]   All right, number two.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.460]   And this one I like.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.420]   Intellectual property developers.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:10.020]   It's like one of those guys who has the voice recorder.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.900]   Note to self.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.580]   I think it just puts words together.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.940]   That makes things sound so good.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.740]   It's exactly mint chocolate chip real estate.
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.920]   The only thing protecting the movie and TV
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.000]   industries from the fate that has befallen music and indeed
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.320]   the newspaper business is the size of the files.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.960]   I would agree with him on that.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.460]   Sure.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.020]   The immutable laws of bandwidth tell us
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.380]   we're just a few years away from being
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.920]   able to download an entire season of 24 in 24 seconds.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.000]   I think that's happening now with "Doxys III."
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.640]   So if you can get it, feed it.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.160]   If you can get it fed to you.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.120]   We're at the post office, they tells us.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.320]   We're the post office.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.760]   Who knows what's in the brown paper packages?
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.320]   But we--
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:50.820]   I don't know.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:51.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.040]   I must have left something out.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.960]   A decade's worth of music file sharing and swiping
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.800]   has made it clear the people it hurts are the creators.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.160]   In this case, the young fledgling songwriters who
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.000]   can't live off ticket and t-shirt sales.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.600]   You know, in the last time I went to a YouTube concert,
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.400]   it was $150 for a ticket.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.640]   Bono.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.520]   T-shirt sales like the least sympathetic among us
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   and the people that's reverse Robinhooding benefits
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.360]   are rich service providers who swole in profits perfectly
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.480]   mirror the last receipts of the music business.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.720]   Where's he going to get to intellectual property developers?
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.480]   I don't know.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.680]   He doesn't get to it at all.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.480]   This is bogus.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.040]   OK, next one.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.600]   Equal right to pollute and the polluter pays principle.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.000]   I think this is carbon credits.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.960]   Carbon tax, carbon credit, carbon cap and trade.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.680]   Carbon cap and trade.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:43.160]   A person, Dr. William Lee, and a word, angiogenesis,
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.680]   a process by which new blood vessels grow.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.880]   This is good.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.560]   I think that's when it's very bad.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.800]   I think Heath Richard used this, didn't he?
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.040]   Blood vessels are the supply lines of cancerous tumors.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.400]   Dr. William Lee of the Angiogenesis Foundation
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.840]   is called research in this realm, the first medical revolution
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.800]   of the 21st century.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.800]   I think there are medical revolutions about them.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.640]   I don't think this is it.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.840]   One of which is tailored anti-cancer drugs.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.960]   Every cancer in every human is different.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.720]   One of the reasons that chemo is so horrible
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.680]   is because it's a scatter shot.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.160]   What's the spectrum?
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.400]   But they are getting much better at doing individual genetic
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.840]   analysis and tailoring a drug to your specific cancer.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.080]   And I think before this decade is out,
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.120]   I, Leo, not I, Bono, that we're going
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.040]   to have these kind of tailored drugs that
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.240]   are very accurate and very effective.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.080]   You need to write a column.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.000]   I should write my--
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.040]   Let's go to the next one.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.560]   Matter doesn't matter.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.520]   It's getting worse.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.240]   God, it appears, is a treky.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.640]   He's talking about Dr. Anton Zilinger, an Austrian physicist
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.480]   who is a rock star of physics for his work
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.160]   in quantum teleportation.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.720]   This Veronica, this could be for certain lessons.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.920]   By the way, in every one of these things,
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.280]   he says that he has this following clause, which
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.840]   I know very little about.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.000]   I don't know how he says it appears.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.040]   God is a treky.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.360]   And then at the end of that paragraph,
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.280]   he said, could it be that God is a nerd?
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.920]   Ooh, he's come a long way in this essay.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.320]   The Festival of Abraham.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.000]   Nice bookends there, Bono.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.800]   Yeah, he's studied writing back in rock and roll school.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.520]   People power in the upside down pyramid.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.560]   I'd go for this.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.800]   This is the lamest thing.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.640]   All right, all right.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.000]   So you skipped the Festival of Abraham.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.520]   I skipped it because I don't understand it.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.200]   What is it?
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.080]   It means that we're all coming together, all the religions.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.960]   And we're going to be singing kumbaya.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:34.440]   He does.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.280]   He says he wants an arts festival that
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.040]   celebrates the origins of the three Abrahamic religions,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.840]   Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.520]   You're going to have to tell you something.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.160]   Yeah, that's going to work.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.320]   Yeah, Bob.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:51.560]   I write about four op-ed pieces a year for the New York Times.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.320]   And they wouldn't publish this crap from me.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.080]   I know.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.920]   It's because it's Bono.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.200]   That's where it got.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   It's like he had it.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:03.000]   I would like to see John Mayer's take on the theater.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.680]   Seriously.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.600]   Maybe Dave Matthews.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.720]   In 2010, my--
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.600]   John Mayer.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.000]   No, you didn't.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:07.600]   Don't bear.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.120]   Don't bear.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:08.600]   John Mayer, man.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.120]   He has a gagget fiend.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.600]   A man knows his stuff.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.880]   You've seen the video of him tech supporting his dad.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.680]   Oh, yeah, it's great.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.200]   He's so funny.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.440]   Dad, you can do this, Dad.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.080]   It's in the system preference pane.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.200]   Dad, don't give up on me.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.160]   It's so funny.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:25.800]   All right, here we go.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.760]   People power in the upside down pyramid.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.040]   I'm firing Bono from this panel.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.280]   I don't care if he's a rock star.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.920]   He mentions Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.800]   OK, well, let's skip to Nick.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.280]   Taking the fight to rotavirus, viva
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.560]   la non-violent revolution.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.240]   You're right, Bob.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.440]   This is crap.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.320]   Kicks off the African decade.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.440]   The African decade coming.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.080]   Now, here's an interesting thing.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.920]   The New York Times just followed--
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.200]   fired one of its freelance colonists
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.800]   for writing a piece on 3M and not disclosing that, in fact,
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.080]   she had been flown to the 3M plant
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:05.480]   and feted and taken out to dinner before she wrote the piece.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.600]   And they said, that's a violation of our-- even
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.840]   our freelancers can't do that.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:09.720]   They fired her.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   Yeah, that's kind of ridiculous.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.840]   I've seen way worse ethical violations
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.960]   occurred at the New York Times over the last five years.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.800]   I mean, way, way worse.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.480]   So we're out together.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.720]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.280]   It was clear.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.520]   But the thing is, she didn't have to disclose it in the piece.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.160]   She should have just told the editor and the editors
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:30.120]   could have disclosed it as a thing at the end in italics.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.960]   Well, our friend David Pogue comes up again
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.520]   in the article that I read about this, which is, what is it?
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.800]   Is it Pinch the New York Times?
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.000]   What is the-- there is a Twitter guy.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.120]   He's got a strange handle, like, tweak the times or something.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:42.880]   So--
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.760]   I mean, David takes money from Raytheon.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.520]   He took-- he took money from Raytheon.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.280]   It goes to Disneyland and speak.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.120]   I mean--
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.600]   How does he get these gigs?
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.640]   If it's a violation of their freelancers agreements,
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.160]   yeah.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.120]   How come I get on that?
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.120]   He's never-- he's not a journalist.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.960]   Oh, what a--
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.460]   He's right.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.200]   I asked him about this, and he said, I'm not a journalist.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.080]   But he's a freelancer writing for the New York Times,
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:03.760]   so I don't know.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.720]   And then he's perceived as such.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.080]   He's also makes him a lot of money.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:07.680]   And so--
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.280]   Yeah, that's the key.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.560]   --unlike this other person.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.200]   So John, what is the big story of the decade going to be?
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.360]   The upcoming decade?
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.360]   Yeah, well, it could be last decade.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.960]   It could be the decade of the tablet.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.920]   You lie.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.920]   No, you'll see.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.280]   You'll be stunned.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.760]   So you think it's not the net book, not the smart book,
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.400]   not the notebook, the tablet?
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.760]   It's the decade of the tablet.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.520]   The decade of the tablet.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.880]   You brought those tablets down from the mount for us?
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.000]   I was just saying.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.040]   How about you, Veronica?
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.640]   What's the big story of the next 10 years going to be?
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.880]   Oh.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.040]   The next big story for the next 10 years--
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:42.440]   I don't know.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.600]   I hate doing this prediction stuff.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.240]   I hate it too.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.200]   In fact, let's just forget it.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.920]   Because no one's ever really right.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.440]   No, yeah.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.000]   You're wrong that they say you're wrong, like five years
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.800]   from now.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.240]   They quote--
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.480]   John, you do this every year.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   It's going to be zero-something.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.240]   It's going to be zero-something again.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.640]   No, it is a zero-something again.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.840]   Because people who picked this stuff,
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.040]   she's actually-- Veronica's absolutely correct.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.120]   This is the thing with me and the mouse.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:04.680]   I wrote it.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.880]   It will live forever.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.240]   It will live forever.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:07.760]   It will live forever.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.880]   I made this off-handed comment that this is a new device
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.400]   and nobody knows if it's going to be successful.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.280]   There's no proof that it is.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:15.920]   You know why we do this?
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.080]   I'm still eating crap for that.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.280]   Because the week between Christmas and New Years,
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.080]   there's no news.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:20.960]   Nothing happens.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.920]   Everybody's gone home.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.360]   So there's nothing to talk about.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:31.240]   Avatar, the first film to cross the billion-dollar mark.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.320]   Today, it's expected that Avatar will cross the $1 billion
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.920]   mark of domestic and international receipts
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.840]   for Rupert Murdoch.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.640]   News Corp open.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.240]   Oh, this is what's--
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:41.680]   Hey, he's the money.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.240]   --20th Century Fox.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.440]   Wow.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.440]   Everybody said this is the most expensive movie ever made.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.760]   We never really found out how much $350 million was
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.400]   this speculation.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.000]   Five.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.400]   Five, even five.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   They've made a billion dollars.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.320]   Everyone thinks five.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.040]   It was a good bet.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.440]   Well, Titanic all over again.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.960]   The same statements were made in '97.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.000]   Well, you know the funny thing is Titanic did not
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.400]   feel like a huge step forward in cinema making.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   It felt like--
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.800]   I mean, it seemed like they really put that money to work.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.880]   Well, for the effects.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.400]   No, I just--
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.000]   --was a huge step forward in the movie list.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.200]   They built like a scale world.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.040]   You know, a three-quarter scale ship and stuff like that.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:21.560]   It was unbelievable.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.600]   I mean, it was an entire studio that was filled with water.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.000]   And it's--
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.600]   Sure, but that was kind of like Brewster's millions
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.880]   in movie form, right?
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.800]   It's like, how can we blow a ton of money?
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.200]   It feels like Avatar, they actually, with this ungodly sum
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   of money that they used to make the movie,
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.360]   really did something--
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.200]   Except that--
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.320]   --and set cinema for work.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.520]   Except give any writer some of the money, apparently.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   But they had to do that to replace the--
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:48.620]   Right.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:49.320]   --imped them with the weird--
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.920]   --we were out of the Caprios eyes.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.920]   Oh, snap it.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.920]   They had limped pools.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.040]   They were just computer-generated limped pools.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.280]   I've been laughing lately because all the geek guys have
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.680]   been going nuts over Avatar and seeing it three or four times.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.360]   Those chicks are hot.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.800]   I was like, now you know what it was like when we were pre-teensing
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.080]   Titanic over time.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:05.580]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:06.640]   They pre-teamed girls.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.920]   Those eight-foot-tall blue chicks, they were hot.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   Don't look at me like that.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.600]   It's like cartoon for god's sake.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.560]   Most of my love life is a cartoon, John.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.040]   That's it.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.480]   It's not--
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.760]   I thought the movie was a disappointment.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.680]   I thought it was spectacular to watch this on the IMAX.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.120]   Well, for one thing, I didn't like the fake 3D.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.640]   I mean, they were-- if they were doing depth of field shooting,
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.480]   this is not 3D by any means.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.960]   I mean, if the background's out of focus,
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.960]   how am I supposed to focus on it to get the 3D effect?
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.320]   That works in 2D, actually.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.280]   That's how you do 3D in 2D.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.960]   I'm sure it was shot for 2D.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.840]   And they just put the 3D stuff in there.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.440]   No, I know.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.160]   It was shot explicitly for 3D.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.040]   Well, then why were they doing depth of field shots?
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:48.520]   I don't know.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.720]   It was very annoying.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:54.280]   I kind of wish I had not seen it in 3D the first time, at least,
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.440]   because I found it very distracting.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.720]   Me too, Veronica.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.000]   And a lot of people say they didn't bother them,
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.960]   but it involved me.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.120]   Yeah, but you've got a visual look.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:02.680]   No, no.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.800]   I was able to see the 3D.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.720]   I was very surprised.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.000]   But I was wearing-- first of all, my advice.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.520]   Don't wear glasses to the movie, because you'll
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.040]   be wearing two pairs of glasses, which is--
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.360]   Were you-- did you see the 3D iMacs?
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.560]   I saw a real D, which had the black point extra glasses
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.120]   that you wear over your regular glasses.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.280]   It was effective.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.280]   I would like to see it in iMacs.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.440]   It's hard to get in iMacs, even in San Francisco right now.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.720]   It's still sold out.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.840]   But the glasses for the iMacs are like--
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.320]   Yeah, I've worn those before.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.040]   Did you see in the iMacs, Veronica?
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.640]   Yeah, Ryan and I saw it last Friday.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.040]   And you're saying it kind of bugged you.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.400]   I wanted to see it in 2D, too.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.240]   I saw it out.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.760]   I was like, I was like, I see it again.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.280]   2D.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.320]   What, Bob?
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.600]   I saw Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.160]   How was that?
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.680]   This was cool.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.520]   It was cool.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:48.960]   It was good.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.160]   The guy from Chuck is in it.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.920]   He plays a loser.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.000]   Really?
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.000]   That's a stretch.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.240]   OK, where are we?
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.280]   Where are we on the list?
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:57:59.720]   Twitter.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:02.120]   In 10 years, will there be a Twitter?
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.520]   No.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.320]   Veronica?
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:05.840]   Maybe.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.800]   I don't know.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.400]   I guess.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.000]   This is what you're here on the show for you.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:09.560]   I know.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.000]   That's the squid.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.200]   No, she's not supposed to be honest.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.640]   No, there will not be a Twitter.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.000]   Thank you.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:14.840]   That's all I have to say.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.320]   And you don't have to justify--
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.320]   Tell me back in 10 years and let me know how that works out.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.160]   Would be called something else.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.040]   Ryan?
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.320]   What do you mean by Twitter?
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.880]   I mean, Twitter is going to be a big technology.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.440]   Twitter is going to be a big technology.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.160]   You can say no.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.080]   You could say that the idea will persist.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.840]   But will Twitter.com still be the venue it is today?
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.920]   Or will it be like the friendster.com?
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:36.920]   I think it is highly probable that with--
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.680]   a kind of broadcast push publishing protocols
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.720]   like Pub/Sub/Hub/Hub/ub and WebFinger and stuff like that,
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   that you're going to see the kind of decentralization
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.360]   of status updates.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.240]   And in effect, that could really undermine Twitter
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.720]   and to a certain degree Facebook.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.040]   I think it's entirely possible.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.720]   I mean, I think if Twitter was smart,
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.840]   they would try to get in on that now
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.200]   and try to own as much of that as they could
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.840]   to maintain their dominant position.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.760]   They have an opportunity, but they have to open.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.680]   They really have to open.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.520]   Yeah, if it does become decentralized
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.360]   and they're not in on that really early,
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.680]   it's going to really sneak up on them
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.240]   and could potentially really damage them.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.600]   Bob, have you heard of Twitter?
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.600]   Yes, and Alvin has as well.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:25.640]   I think that Twitter won't be a brand in 10 years
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:31.320]   and that it will peak and they'll sell out on the downside.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.960]   How about Twitter is just the API,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.320]   but not as a website anymore?
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.240]   It's a good API.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.600]   That probably will continue,
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.800]   but under someone else's ownership.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.840]   Well, it's already happened.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.120]   Who is it?
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.240]   WordPress.com.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.480]   A couple of sites are now using the Twitter API
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.240]   so you can use Twitter third party tools
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.640]   to post to WordPress.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.560]   Yeah, it's wild.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.120]   By the way, somebody in the chat room
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.120]   is really giving Veronica a bad time saying
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.680]   that the only thing she's sure about
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.680]   is she's not going to wear the blonde wig.
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.360]   (laughs)
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.520]   Don't pay any attention to him.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.920]   I put my foot down on that.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.640]   I just don't like predictions
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.960]   'cause I think things change so quickly
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.400]   that it's kind of hard to say.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.240]   I agree with you.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.440]   I'm gonna have it in a decade.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440]   They're all boldness.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.720]   But they're kind of fun.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.840]   In a decade.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.000]   Well, what sci-fi...
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:14.840]   It's not my takers.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.840]   Let's talk about sci-fi
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.760]   'cause you do a little sword and laser podcast
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.400]   with Tom Merritt and you're very into sci-fi.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.280]   Is there a sci-fi thing that you've seen in the movies,
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.400]   you've read in a book that you think will become real?
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   Concept is a good one.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.520]   A concept that might become real in the next 10 years.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.360]   It's Leo, it is just...
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.800]   Terraforming.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.760]   Oh, I like that.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.320]   Terraforming.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320]   What will we Terraforming?
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   Terraforming.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.320]   Oh, I thought Dubai, maybe.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.320]   (laughing)
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.040]   That's maybe more the 25-year range.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.640]   I think 10 years, I don't think
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.560]   we're gonna start Terraforming yet.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.400]   Who knows?
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.240]   Things might get bad.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.640]   You've read Red Green, Blue Mars.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.320]   Might have to push it forward a little bit.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.160]   Who knows?
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.120]   I'm gonna predict a new programming language
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.160]   that will set the world on fire within the next 10 years.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.320]   (laughing)
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.160]   You can...
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.320]   (laughing)
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   That's a safe bear.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   (laughing)
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.240]   Google's working on that new language.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.240]   What's it called?
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   Go.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   Go.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.240]   It's got an exclamation mark.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   Go.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240]   Could work.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.240]   Ryan, what do you think?
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.240]   A science fiction...
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240]   It's a private and anemic Google programming language.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.240]   Will we see a replicator?
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.160]   You know what I think we might see?
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.120]   We might see the holodeck.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   I think that...
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.120]   I don't know about that.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.240]   Those physicists are working on the transportation stuff.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:31.640]   They all say uniformly that I've seen that it works on a very small atomic or subatomic
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.480]   level, but it doesn't work on large objects.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.920]   They can't move massive structures.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.000]   I'm never putting my thing in a wormhole.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   That's just not gonna happen.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   I think radar on cars.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.760]   That's what he said.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.080]   I would really like to see...
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.960]   I don't think that we will have it in the next 10 years.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.720]   I would really like to see an automatic transportation system, all a minority report.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.440]   We were actually just talking about this last night at dinner.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.760]   I'm not into jetpacks.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.760]   I'm not in a flying car.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.760]   I think that's...
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   That's kind of the best way to get to me.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   That's kind of the best way to get to me.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.760]   You can go back to drinking at night.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.640]   I think actually of all the things you just said, autonomous vehicles is the most likely
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.080]   thing that happened in the next 10 years.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080]   Absolutely.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.240]   The reason why I think doing anything is to make that happen is because of the massive
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.600]   amount of infrastructure that would need to change in order to really, really make it
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   work correctly.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.640]   What are the years that it takes to make the national highway system like 50 years?
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.520]   You don't have to put wires in the highway.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.520]   I don't see it.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:34.720]   I think between DOCSIS 3 and terrorism, we're going to see the rise of residential telepresence.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.280]   Ooh, I like that.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.480]   Nobody's going to want to travel because they don't want to sit in their seat for the last
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.880]   hour.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.000]   We know 4K screens will be around certainly in the next few years.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.080]   They're already out there.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.160]   That's so high.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.640]   It's quad current high definition, enough so that it really feels real.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.000]   You put it on a big screen, maybe one whole end of your room.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.280]   There's a dichotomy here because there's a huge group of younger people, for example.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.240]   They don't even care about these big screen TVs.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.120]   They do watch everything on their laptops.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.920]   They don't have a TV set of any sort.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   They don't want to flash them.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.920]   And they don't want to travel.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   They don't want to meet people.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.920]   They just want to stay home.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.920]   They don't want to do anything.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.920]   They don't care really.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   There's no market.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.360]   Oh, you do also have to remember that a lot of people who are younger are not necessarily
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.600]   spending their daytime on computers.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:28.000]   If they're in class, they're not sitting on laptops all day long doing laptop stuff.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.200]   So that's more of a recreational thing for them.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.280]   I think once a lot of these people join the workforce and they're working on their computers
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.120]   all day, there is actually a little bit more incentive to shut the laptop down, go in the
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.440]   living room and just relax a little bit in front of the TV.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440]   Maybe you're right.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.440]   So that could change.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.440]   I mean, they could swing the other way a little bit.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.200]   This is a prediction as people get older.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.960]   Vivek Kundra will become president and put John de Vorac in jail.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.960]   I like it.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.400]   I think that might well happen.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.400]   I'll just kidding.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.360]   There might well happen.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.320]   That could very well be in your future.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.960]   The binary and the cobalting.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.960]   The binary.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960]   All right.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.960]   I like this.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:10.480]   So Bob says we're going to have telepresence because nobody's going to travel anymore.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.000]   Ryan, you say autonomous vehicles.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.080]   I'm not predicting it's going to happen, but I hope you say it could happen.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.080]   I would like it.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.080]   Could happen in a decade.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   I think we're close to that.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   We got the radar and all that.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   Brad Templeton, yes.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.640]   And that's going to happen.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   Veronica, you predict terraforming.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   Sure, why not?
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.080]   We'd like to see her terraform her hair into blonde.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.440]   Oh, John, you are singularly focused.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.920]   It's because he's dressed as a Renfaire character.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.920]   What do you predict will happen?
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.720]   That's going to be the decade of the tablet of the...
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   Stop it.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.360]   No, I'm asking you a sci-fi thing.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   Oh, a sci-fi thing.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.880]   A sci-fi thing that's in movies now, but might happen actually.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.080]   How about minority report style gesturing?
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.080]   I know.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.640]   I think there'll be a pre-crime thing like minority.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640]   Pre-crime?
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640]   I think there'll be pre-crime.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.880]   And we'll start arresting people for bad thinking.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.800]   I think there's going to be fascism in the form of the way it's been shown on the sci-fi.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   It's our sci-fi.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.480]   We're going to have a fascist world government that's going to be a disaster.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.400]   How many more economic collapses before that happens?
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.600]   We're going to have a big one in 2013.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.600]   And will that be the...
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.920]   That's the trigger.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   The trigger?
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.920]   Yeah, we're doomed after that.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.440]   Make your money, find a hole.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.440]   Gold?
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.440]   Should I get gold?
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.440]   Can't goods?
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   Can't goods.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:24.440]   That's always good.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.200]   The last x number of years though, the can'ts.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.200]   Tried.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.200]   Free strum.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200]   Lentils.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.200]   Actually lentils and rice.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200]   Bob, no, I know for a fact.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.800]   The reason Bob's in South Carolina, he has cornered the lentil market.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   Lentils and rice.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.640]   You just have like a bags and bags and bags.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.320]   Black eyed peas, baby.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   You know.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.560]   Well, you might be right.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.560]   So fascism.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.280]   So what would we do to prepare for that?
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.120]   Well, I think we first of all, Bob.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   What are the things we've got to do?
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.320]   What would we do to prepare for that?
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.320]   We've got to line up our clothing.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.920]   I want a uniform.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   So we all have sweater vests.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.840]   Guns, by the way, could come in quite handy.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:57.840]   Sweater vests.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.840]   Like you, John?
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.520]   It's the future is sweater vests.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520]   All right.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.320]   Your tour is now and it's sweater vests.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.480]   Let's talk in sweater vests.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:11.480]   Let's talk about technologies that have long been called for but haven't emerged, obviously
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.840]   flying cars aren't going to happen.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.840]   And the tablet.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.200]   And the tablet?
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.160]   How about voice recognition?
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.800]   We see major improvement.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.800]   No.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.760]   So we can keep screaming at our technology.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   Machine translation.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   That's another one.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.200]   I hear we're very close to voice recognition.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.200]   Machine translation.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.200]   What's machine translation?
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.200]   You translate French to German to English to English.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.320]   Google does a pretty good job.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   Pretty good.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.600]   Are you really ever doing anything serious with this?
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.280]   I write to Abby's family.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.880]   They don't speak English and I don't speak French.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.560]   So I write to them using Google translate.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.640]   We've had some interesting comedy.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.280]   Chris Merriman kind of mix ups but sometimes.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:50.000]   I was something for the live translation like they showed at the Intel.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Wait a second.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   That's C.E.S.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.560]   A couple of years ago where you just point like a camera at a street sign in a foreign
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.720]   language and it automatically translates it within your viewfinder.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.720]   Google goggles.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.720]   Google goggles.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.720]   Love Google goggles.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.280]   I wish Google goggles would do face recognition.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   I predict a heads up display.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.280]   You like saying it.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.280]   Google goggles.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.240]   I predict a heads up display with a little earpiece and something that's shining on
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.240]   my retina.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.640]   As I walk down the street, he'll say that's Veronica Belmont.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.040]   You used to work with her in 2009.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.120]   So no more of this.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.120]   Hiya.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   How are you doing?
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.120]   Exactly.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   You look over in Sizzi.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   Yeah, she has 14 kids and now is a blonde.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:33.960]   Isn't that the wuffy stuff from down and out in the magic thing?
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   It's like wuffy.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960]   Or a doctor or a book.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.440]   Our next door and laser pick by the way.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.440]   Is it?
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.440]   That's a good one.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440]   It is.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.440]   It's a good one.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.440]   It's a good one.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.440]   It's a good one.

[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.440]   What about Google?
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.440]   What's Google going to look like in 2020?
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.120]   You know, really hard to tell.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.120]   They've gotten into a lot of markets that I don't think people would have seen them
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.160]   get into even just two or three years ago.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.880]   They now have a mobile phone platform.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.800]   They have a desktop operating system that's about to come out.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.760]   They've got a browser.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.600]   I mean, they've actually started to permeate the device side of things, which is really
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.520]   kind of crazy when you think about where Google has come from.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.520]   So I don't know.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:05.200]   I do know that for all of the trepidation people have about Google, every time I have
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.880]   let Google into my life any deeper than they were before, it has always been a good thing
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880]   for me.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880]   It's always worked out for me.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.280]   Google makes life better.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.240]   How about this for a concept?
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.520]   Somebody comes along, a group of people, and they come up with the most amazing algorithm
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.840]   we've ever seen for search and destroys Google overnight.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.640]   Google's not in search anymore.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.880]   That's why they still make their money though.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880]   They're making their money on.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.280]   It's very rapidly moving away from search.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.360]   There's so much lock in with Google now.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.960]   I mean, between mail, calendar, apps.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.080]   If being more better, let's say--
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.880]   You're so much in the end of living like a Google life.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880]   Bing is out of the paper.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.320]   Let's say, well, no, let's say Bing were better.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   Just pretend.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.240]   Is it Bing were Bing are?
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.240]   Bing is a good thing.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.240]   Well, it's a subjunctive.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.320]   Is Bing better?
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   Bing is.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.320]   But Bing were better.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   Doesn't matter.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   It doesn't matter.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   That's the right answer.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   Thank you.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.080]   That better is not good enough.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   That's exactly right.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.040]   You guys are all wrong.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   You think--
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.040]   And it's about the halo too.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:09.080]   Bing doesn't have the halo of web apps that Google does that improve your life in a variety
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]   of different ways.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.040]   Would you rather use Gmail or would you rather use Hotmail?
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.040]   Gmail.
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:17.920]   I mean, I don't think anybody would say Hotmail unless they still use Hotmail and they just
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.440]   don't want to switch yet.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.840]   I don't think that Google will ever end up being the quote "Microsoft" in 2020.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.960]   I think they encouraged innovative thinking in a way that maybe Microsoft hasn't in the
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   past.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.000]   And I think that'll keep them fresh going into that next decade instead of kind of stagnating
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.240]   and just becoming one of those companies that we kind of laugh at in a way in that regard.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.240]   We should be--
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.360]   You know, when we talk about the halo of apps and we talk about comparing it to Bing, we
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.760]   should be comparing Google to Yahoo.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.800]   Yahoo was a big leader until Google came along.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:52.560]   And Yahoo has a million kinds of things going on, groups and mail and everything in between.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.240]   And lots of the stuff, of course, has failed.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.560]   The tubes thing and all the rest of the stuff that they've tried to do and they have flicker
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.080]   and all the rest of it.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.720]   And they just go-- just going by the way, I'm telling you the same thing can happen to
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.720]   Google.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720]   And I think Google knows this.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.360]   Well, I think a big part of the reason why Yahoo went wayward is because they took focus
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.480]   away from their technology products and they put it more towards their content product.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.880]   Well, it turns out that it worked.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.800]   You know, it's not a bad move though.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.960]   I mean, they've got like top 10 content properties.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   They're doing great.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   Oh, sure.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:24.640]   But it's slipping and the way that the web is moving now, it's moving away from that kind
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.720]   of a content portal.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.160]   It's moving away from a lot of these destination sites like Yahoo.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.920]   And that's why you've seen AOL really kind of refresh its content strategy away from
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.560]   AOL.com and more towards products like Seed and Engadget and so on.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.720]   To your point, Veronica, though, this is why it's so difficult to predict because right
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.120]   now Google is clearly, you know, master the universe.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.840]   But in technology, discontinuities happen where things just change unpredictably.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.960]   And to your point, John, somebody could come along and best Google by just a flip of an
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.960]   algorithm.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   And it's unpredictable.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.600]   You don't know when that's going to happen.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.720]   Well, you know, you know, one thing.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.000]   I know when an audible commercial is about to happen.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   Me too.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.840]   Right now, folks, if you're not listening to audiobooks from audible.com, you're missing
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.960]   out on a world of great entertainment.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.280]   Look, everybody got up and left.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   It's amazing.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.800]   I hope she went to get the blonde wig.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   Come back in a moment.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.720]   We'll see if Veronica got the blonde wig.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.200]   Nope.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.600]   Audible.com is the place to go for audiobook.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.400]   65,000 titles and growing all the time, some of the best books in the world.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.560]   And I always look at audible first to see if it's on there because that's how I like
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560]   to read.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.880]   Now, I get email every day saying, no, it's not reading.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.560]   Yes, it is reading.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.920]   You're listening to every word that was on the written page, but it's being read to you
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:50.280]   by a very talented actor who has the style, the penage, the pacing to help you get into
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.160]   the book in a way that you just cannot get on paper.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.080]   I am a huge Audible fan.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.200]   Highly recommend you check it out and I'm going to make it possible for you to do so
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   absolutely free.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.120]   In fact, your first two audible books are free.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:08.320]   If you go to audible.com/twit2 right now, you'll sign up for the platinum account.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.280]   That is a two book a month account.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.080]   And as I said, your first two are free.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.360]   If you're looking for a good one to pick, there's so many great choices.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.640]   What was a sword and laser book this week?
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.880]   Down and out in the Magic Kingdom.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.480]   That is not unaudible.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.720]   I'm sorry to say.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.000]   I'm sure if you ask nicely, Corey, we'll read it to you.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.080]   Corey would actually call you up and read it to you if you want to.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.800]   They do have some wonderful sci-fi.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.440]   Audible has really made an effort to enhance the sci-fi category with their Audible frontiers.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.560]   They read books that never were recorded.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:47.120]   If you're going back and reading some classic sci-fi, Audible is a great way to do it.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.360]   I know you've in the past with sword and laser used Audible and recommended Audible.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:55.720]   I just got the sort of Avalon because of you and Tom.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.240]   Actually, because of Tom said you should read it.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.240]   It's really good.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.400]   We've just finished Miss of Avalon.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400]   Miss of Avalon.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   But they have a whole series.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   They have a whole series.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   Miss the first one.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   This is the first one.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   Right?
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   Miss is the first.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   Yes.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.760]   He's back into prequels.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.800]   I said, "Oh, that's just going to be girly."
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.000]   But then he said, "No, it's Arthurian legend."
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.080]   That's when he had me at Arthurian legend.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.400]   Tom knows his Arthurian legend.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.840]   I love Arthurian legend.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.440]   Tom is like an encyclopedia of that stuff.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.440]   It's incredible.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:29.240]   Like on our last show, he just talked and talked and talked and I was like, "Wow.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.960]   You really knew a lot more about this than I thought you did."
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.960]   It's so cool.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.840]   Now, there's a bridge and there's unabridged.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:39.920]   Natasha Richardson reads the abridged version.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.880]   She would be wonderful.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:48.000]   But I have to say, I'm sorry, I am an abridged guy.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.520]   They have, Davina Porter reads, "It's a three volume set.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.800]   But you get your first two for free."
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.840]   And Davina Porter is absolutely, I'm just going to play a little bit of this.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.240]   One of Audible's best readers.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.920]   She has such a great British accent.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:05.560]   There was a time when a traveler, if he had the will and knew only a few of the secrets,
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.920]   would send his barge out into the summer sea and arrive not at Glastonbury of the monks,
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.920]   but at the holy aisle of Avalon.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.680]   Oh, I love her voice.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.280]   My favorite reader is Jenny Stirling.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.440]   Oh, I have to look for her.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.680]   She's a great voice.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:27.080]   They have such, you know, people actually, when they become Audible fans, start looking
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.240]   for the readers that they want to listen to.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.880]   Not just the books.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   Audible.com.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.880]   Here's what you do.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.520]   Audible.com/twit2, our recommendation this week, Mistress of Magic, the mists of Avalon
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.960]   Book One and its sequel.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.720]   Get your, both of those absolutely free.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:46.000]   That right there, that's like 30 hours of great Audible listening.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.240]   But there are many, many choices.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240]   We thank you for their support.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.400]   We encourage you to give them a try.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.440]   I love it and I know you will too.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.440]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.200]   Continuing on with our decade.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.960]   Well, you're still Audible.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.160]   I'm asking when are you going to do some books?
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.640]   You know, you have the greatest voice in the world, please.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.520]   It's a lot of work.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.680]   It's a huge amount of work.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.680]   I did it.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.680]   How would it take to do a book?
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.280]   Well, Corey Doctor asked me to read for fun.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.600]   He put an album out of his short stories.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.560]   He asked me to read one of his short stories.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.240]   It was an hour long short story.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.480]   It took me about 20 hours in recording and editing.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.480]   You get it right.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.480]   Oh, really?
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.480]   That stinks.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.480]   Well, I know.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.400]   Now, maybe I'm slower.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.080]   You know, I need a producer and all that, but I did all myself.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.080]   But it was fun.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.920]   It was really fun, but boy, it was a lot of work.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.320]   He got some good people reading that.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.640]   Robin Williams had a show on Audible.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.680]   Yes, loved that show.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.640]   An interview show and I don't know how long he was.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.800]   He talked to Walter Cronkite.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.880]   He did about a dozen of them, I think.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.240]   But he did a two part.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:47.480]   If you ever can listen to it, he did a two part with Buddy Hackett.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.960]   I did listen to that.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.600]   And Buddy Hackett destroyed him.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.880]   It was so funny.
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.840]   And Robin Williams did not have a chance against Buddy Hackett.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.480]   Yep.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480]   That was a great series.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.120]   I'm just looking to see if Audible still offers those for download.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.120]   They may not.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120]   Oh, that's a bummer.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.240]   Of course, because he was embarrassed by Buddy Hackett.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.240]   It was very funny.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.240]   Well, it's in my--
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.240]   You do have a great voice.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.240]   So you should be doing that.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.240]   Come on now.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   Thank you.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.240]   I know you're a busy guy, but--
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.240]   That's what it is.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.720]   He's too busy for this kind of stuff for the public.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.440]   I like doing-- I'm doing what I'm doing.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.440]   I like what I'm doing.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.440]   I'm making it up.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.440]   You're on 24/7.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.440]   I don't have time to read.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.200]   I did though when I did the Corey thing, I did it on Twit Live.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.960]   And people were listening and making fun of me.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.440]   And I did the editing and everything.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:31.520]   So I'll let you know when that comes out.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.480]   But Corey, does that stuff for free?
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.800]   Ooh, repent Harlequin said the TikTok man.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.040]   All right, so what else do we have for predictions?
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.040]   We're going to have to do this year.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.040]   Ah, cloud.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.000]   What is going to happen to cloud computing in 2010 to 2020 time
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:45.520]   frame?
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.720]   No, I some have predicted that I think this is probably true,
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.200]   that we will no longer have data on drives.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.320]   Our data will live out there.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.640]   But they've been secreated.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.760]   I don't think that's true.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760]   You don't like it.
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:55.760]   I do.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.760]   I don't think it's true.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   I don't like it.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760]   I don't care.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.760]   But it's too unreliable.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.760]   It's solid.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.520]   I don't care, whatever.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.520]   It's reliable.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.920]   You agree that this is going to be the--
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.120]   What's the terrorist in the next year or two?
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.680]   The cloud you're doomed.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.680]   Terrorists.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.680]   I'm telling you.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.680]   Terrorists in the cloud.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.360]   That's going to be a big theme for the next decade.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.600]   Hey, look, if the world's going to be taken over by fascists
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.240]   and terrorists and we're all living in our houses in fear,
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.400]   we're going to need the cloud.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.600]   Really?
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.240]   What am I-- what?
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.960]   I'm going to sit here and not connect to anything?
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.840]   You're going to get connected and wow,
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.000]   they're going to-- it's going to be bad.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.400]   So you should say I should have like a data dome over my house.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.400]   Silence.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.400]   Data dome.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   That's what we need.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400]   The dome of silence.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.200]   So Veronica, I'm with you.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.080]   You use Google Docs now.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.640]   I'm sure for everything, right?
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.600]   Don't come crying to me when everything disappears.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.320]   I mean, I like to have local backups of everything just
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.280]   to be on the safe side.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.240]   And I think that's just a good practice to have in general.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.160]   But I definitely think within the next 10 years,
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.520]   we're not going to have to worry about hard drives
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.200]   for our day-to-day computing needs at all.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.440]   You know what I just started using, and I just love it.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.080]   It's a service called Backupify.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.760]   Do you know about Backupify?
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.440]   No.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.160]   It's designed to backup your cloud.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.080]   So it's from the cloud to the cloud.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.640]   It uses Amazon Web Services.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.440]   It's free if you use your Amazon account.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.480]   It backs up Twitter, WordPress, Facebook,
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.280]   Delicious, Basecamp, Google Docs, Zoho, Flickr, Photo Bucket.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.200]   That is pretty cool.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.200]   Gmail is non-functioning currently,
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.320]   but they was working.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.480]   I'm sure they'll get it working again.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:25.680]   Well, OK.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.520]   So here's a question.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:30.120]   What does it do if you have a service like a Twitter,
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.240]   for example, or something that can't really be--
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.600]   say a service goes out of business.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.600]   What happens to that data?
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.320]   How is it being compressed or encrypted?
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.440]   And how do you get it back, if it's a--
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.520]   Oh, you mean restoring it?
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:41.920]   I don't know.
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:43.960]   Nobody knows.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.320]   Did you exist anymore in the cloud?
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.320]   Just kiss it goodbye.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.080]   No, no, no.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.120]   Look, here, I've got--
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.720]   this is-- these are my archives in Backupify.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.040]   I've got--
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:51.960]   I'm so ZexML.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:52.680]   Yeah, it is.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.520]   It's all stored in a standard XML format.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.080]   Somebody would have to write a XML reader to get it back.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.960]   But these are all the pictures I've uploaded to Flickr.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.560]   They're all stored here.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.520]   Here is my entire blog, not just the data,
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.760]   but also the design.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.160]   Everything's stored here.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.880]   And this happens automatically daily.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.760]   My Facebook posts stored as metadata in XML pictures.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.000]   This is what you need.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.120]   If you're going to live in the cloud, you need a backup.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.000]   And now it's back up to Amazon.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.520]   Somebody mentioned this in the chat.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.680]   Can you-- did you have the opportunity to back up
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.440]   on this backupify thing, your GeoCities website that
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.200]   was wiped out overnight?
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.760]   No, I didn't have a GeoCities button.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.760]   Oh, snap.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.280]   Of course.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.320]   So what about you, Ryan?
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.000]   You live in the cloud.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.160]   You think the cloud 2020 is all going to be cloud, baby?
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.520]   I think it's going to be a very cloud-centric blend.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   I think there's still going to be--
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   It's got to be.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.560]   --all the data storage.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.600]   It's got to be.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.760]   Yeah, but I mean, look, I don't think anybody is going to seriously
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.440]   argue the concept that we are moving towards the web
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:59.280]   as the medium in which we interact with applications and data.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.280]   But there's always a need to have data locally.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.880]   And that's not going to go away just
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.480]   like there's always going to be a need to have a desktop operating
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.640]   system.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.360]   Even if that desktop operating system--
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.800]   Well, I mean, look, Chrome OS is a really interesting example.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.240]   That is a desktop operating system.
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.080]   But it doesn't really do a whole lot other than run a browser.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.000]   But the thing that was interesting about that announcement
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.480]   was the fact that they're limitations.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.360]   I mean, you can't just run a browser.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.680]   You still have to have some kind of windowing system.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.240]   You still have to be able to plug in a printer or plug
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.920]   in a digital camera or something in order
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.880]   to be able to interact with this stuff.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.040]   So we're not there yet.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.560]   There needs to be certain things for you
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.320]   to be able to interact with your devices and your data.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.320]   And the web is not a solution for that.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.320]   So there has to be an intermediary.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.760]   And that is, in most cases, an operating system
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.480]   with a local storage solution.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.520]   Mr. Kringley, what do you think of the cloud?
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.440]   I think that I'll always have local copies of everything.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.360]   Well, we agree on that.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.720]   But is the primary place--
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.720]   You do have a green and green and green.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.560]   No, you think that the--
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.400]   I tried to run a company on Google Docs.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.920]   And I thought it was a disaster.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.360]   Oh, interesting.
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.160]   And so it will get better.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.320]   But the funny thing is that being as we are,
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.920]   I get pretty good tech support.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.320]   And so when I tell 300,000 readers
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.240]   that I'm trying to run a company on Google Docs,
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.040]   and it's not going very well, then someone from Google
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.320]   calls up.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.000]   And they say, well, what's the problem?
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.640]   And I say, well, well, you know, I'm trying to do this,
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.920]   and it doesn't work.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.960]   And so they say, well, all you have to do
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.120]   is do this and this and this.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:37.760]   And it's fine.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   Everyone should get that.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.840]   And I say, wait a minute.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:42.240]   You have to be an avatar to know what this and this and this
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:43.240]   are.
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.480]   And Google, you can maybe think that way.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.720]   That's how engineers are.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.800]   When the top of the screen is--
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.960]   Regular people don't do what you do.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.960]   You know, when I was working at Apple 30 years ago,
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.000]   honestly, I got 30 years ago, we would test--
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.320]   we would test a guy would bring a program in,
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.760]   and we would run it up on an Apple II.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:05.480]   And the first thing I would do is pound on the keyboard.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.120]   And the engineer would immediately say, don't do that.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.120]   No one would ever do that.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:12.120]   And I said, do you have a three-year-old?
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.720]   Also, what you're saying is that the problem with cloud
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.760]   adoption is that people don't know how to use it right now?
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.640]   Now, what I'm saying is that there
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.600]   is no problem with cloud adoption,
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.080]   except that right now it doesn't work as well as it should,
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:28.280]   because the people who are rolling it out
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.600]   can't relate very well to the user.
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.960]   That's the history of technology.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.480]   That's, yeah, that's how it always works.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.040]   I mean, things that we know how to do--
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.760]   Why would you be chance, please, right now?
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.720]   Yeah, Lewis, I am interested.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.680]   It's a message to Lewis.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.760]   By the way, let me just say something that hasn't been
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.400]   brought up here.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.040]   OK.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:44.680]   Here we go.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:45.480]   We got the cloud.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.240]   You're on the cloud.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.200]   You're on cloud system B. And you've got all everything.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.080]   Oh, you got your mail.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:50.640]   You got your dish.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.160]   You got your-- that's one day somebody
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.800]   takes a dislike to you and says, you know,
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.320]   I think you're a spammer.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.840]   We're cutting off your account.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:57.920]   Hey, you know what my friend Bill--
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.080]   So you have local backups.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.200]   We've already said that with a few times.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:00.640]   That's why it's important.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:01.680]   You've got to have a local--
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.040]   But here's--
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:02.040]   But here's--
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.040]   Well, you're not going to have a local--
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:03.880]   I'll give you a good example.
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.400]   My friend Bill Jellin, Mr. Excel,
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.960]   has been for the last four years making videos on YouTube
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.640]   to help people use Excel.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.560]   For reasons that Google will not tell him, no one knows.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.160]   They deleted his account and all his videos, they're gone.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.600]   This guy is making a living helping people with Excel.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.120]   He was giving these videos away.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:25.960]   Google deleted them.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:28.320]   They're gone.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.800]   And that's a good example.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:30.640]   I mean, I--
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.280]   That's a great example.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.080]   And even if he has local-- even if he has local backups,
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:36.920]   that's not the point.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.920]   There's no longer on YouTube.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:40.560]   So what is he going to upload them all?
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.480]   No, they say you can't create another account
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:46.480]   once we've deleted your account, your persona on Grotta.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480]   I mean--
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.320]   I mean--
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.760]   And this is not any kind of justification
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.960]   for that action on Google's part at all.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.120]   There must be a reason, but they won't tell him.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.000]   But to John's point, they can shut you down,
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.360]   and then all of a sudden your email is gone or whatever.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.880]   Well, I mean, if you're concerned about that,
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:06.120]   then don't use a service that you don't control.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.080]   I mean, it seems fairly--
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.040]   All this cloud service seems you don't control.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:09.880]   But you guys are not--
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.800]   Is that kind of the nature of cloud?
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.680]   Yeah, well, exactly.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.040]   So don't use it if you don't want to.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:17.720]   Nobody's forcing you to use Gmail or hosted Google
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.920]   or Google Apps or what I mean.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.480]   So but that's the question.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.640]   Are people going to use cloud going
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.200]   to become the predominant way of computing?
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.160]   In fact, it really leads to a second question, which
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.040]   is the desktop computer, the desktop operating system,
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.840]   how long before--
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:35.440]   And we just don't have such a thing.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.040]   Or we don't even think about such a thing.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.480]   It's such infrastructure.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.080]   It's like middleware.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.120]   But I think we're already there.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.960]   I think actually there's a last round of OS updates.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.760]   This is the last Windows.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.800]   Yeah, between 7 and Snow Leopard, I mean,
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.280]   these were not feature releases anymore.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.880]   These are actually just making the experience faster
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.760]   and more invisible to the user.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.400]   And I think that says a lot about desktop.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:01.080]   So I mean, Apple is saying, yeah, the next major release
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.840]   of our operating system, we're almost not even
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.880]   going to charge you anything for.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.080]   We're going to charge you a token amount of money for it,
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.560]   even though we put almost two years of development into it.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.240]   Because it's not about features at this point.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.200]   It's just making it faster and more invisible,
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.040]   so you can just do the things you want to do.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.480]   And for most people, that's getting on the web.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.880]   By the way, I want to mention the Lewis
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.800]   that you can put his email back up so I can double check
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.560]   that I got it right.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.960]   Hey, this is a very good one.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:26.880]   Hey, show us you.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.000]   It's very loosey-goosey.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.400]   Bob, you got any personal messages to family or friends
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.720]   you'd like to use the network to--
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:32.640]   Hello, mother.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.600]   Well, I got to tell you that I'm three hours ahead of you,
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.720]   and my children are waiting to take their baths.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:39.640]   Bob, let you go.
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:40.160]   We're done.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.040]   Bob, we're done.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.320]   I really thank you for being here,
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.320]   and I hope that we haven't scared you off
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.560]   with the trivial, uncertain nature of this show.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.320]   In fact, it's usually much better prepared and planned.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.880]   But I hope you'll come back and join us again,
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.000]   because the consensus is you were great.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.480]   We really appreciate your time.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.880]   cringley.com, C-R-I-N-G-E-L-Y.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.320]   Next time we bet.
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.720]   Next time-- yeah, these guys have a tradition of making a bet.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.880]   Come on, just before you go, Bob.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.280]   No, a tradition of losing a bet.
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.680]   Well, make a bet, you're going to win, Bob.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.600]   One bit, you get to choose it.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.280]   Make a bet with the Vorac.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.960]   I will underwrite the bet.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:13.800]   Ooh.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.160]   Make it a big one.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.440]   What do you think--
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.440]   Whatever it is, we disagree on.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.000]   Is there anything you guys can disagree on?
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.320]   Years we've probably agreed more often than not.
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.960]   I'm a huge John Dvorak fan.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.320]   And I'm a fantastic Robert-- the real Robert X.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.600]   He is, by the way.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.760]   There are others, but you are the Robert X.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.320]   He's the one who took it upon himself to become--
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.480]   Creator of accidental empires.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.920]   I've been 22 years, so--
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:42.720]   That's quite--
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:43.280]   That counts.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:43.880]   --standing it.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.600]   It's like, you know, common law wife.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.240]   You just-- you got the name, common law name.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.600]   Because I didn't realize that moved to South Carolina, which is--
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.640]   How did that happen?
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.640]   I like to sleep with her.
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.480]   Bob, you have a great evening.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.360]   Thank you for being here.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360]   By the way, Bob, I'm coming to South Carolina.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.640]   Sometimes you have to take me to the best--
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.520]   He's at Charleston.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.200]   Yeah, that's--
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:03.760]   I will.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.640]   I'm right downtown in the historic section of town.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.760]   I'm so jealous.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.720]   That's where I wanted to go.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:09.920]   All right.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:10.400]   Thank you, Bob.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.800]   Take care.
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.640]   Ryan Block is gadget.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:16.040]   GDGT.com, a great gadget podcast.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.720]   He does with Peter Rojas on the website,
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:21.040]   goes sign up and tell him all the different gadgets you own
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.120]   or want to own.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:23.360]   And you learn about those gadgets.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:23.920]   It's a great place.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.960]   And I'm sure it'll be the place to go on Tuesday
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.200]   for coverage of the big--
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.000]   well, we don't know what.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.040]   Nexus 1 announced it.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.200]   Yeah, the Nexus 1 launched.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.000]   Well, you know, we just launched news, too.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:34.880]   Oh, that's great.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.080]   That's a big thing for us.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.760]   So is that just GDGT.com/news or is it right on the front?
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.640]   Well, it's news.gdgt.com.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:45.560]   But the trick with the news is, so one of the things
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:49.280]   that we do is you get this personalized stream of content
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.920]   about the products that you have or that you want.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.600]   So now we personalize your news experience.
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:57.400]   So if you're into the Nexus 1, you're
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.840]   going to get all the news about the Nexus 1 flowing
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.840]   into your home stream.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:03.880]   That is awesome.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.200]   Awesome, awesome.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.320]   Yeah, so the more stuff, the more products you add to your list,
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.880]   the more content that you're going to get.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.200]   Right.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:11.520]   Right.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.880]   And so I've done that.
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.880]   And I keep adding stuff to the list as I get gadgets.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:15.680]   It's really useful.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.680]   So that's good to know.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.720]   That's going to feed my news feed.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:26.400]   And I see you have the Wi-Fi body scale on there.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.520]   I just bought that.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.600]   I just bought that.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.160]   I haven't actually played with it yet.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:30.560]   Yeah, I've been--
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.440]   No, it's tweeting.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.520]   You want to see my weight?
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.240]   All you have to do is go to twitter.com/leoscale.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.840]   Oh, brother.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.080]   Do you want to die it?
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.960]   Yeah, I guess that's the only reason you'd really do that, right?
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:42.920]   To embarrass yourself?
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.280]   So--
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.200]   Which is lie.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.200]   Oh, no, you can't lie.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.640]   You'd get on the scale.
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.320]   And it tweets.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:48.920]   See, there it is.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.880]   It tweets my weight.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.320]   And so every time I get on the scale, it tweets it.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.040]   And that tells you how much more you have to go--
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.200]   218.7?
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.320]   That's down to 10 pounds.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:58.000]   Congratulations.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:58.240]   Thank you.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.600]   You up to 230?
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.080]   I was up to 228.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:03.520]   Yeah, no, I was getting fat there.
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:06.640]   Didn't you sell some sort of patent nostram for weight loss
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.320]   at some point?
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.520]   Easy day at calm.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.560]   You're still doing that?
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.680]   No, I stopped doing that.
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680]   Because you're doing it.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.480]   It was a gimmick.
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:13.240]   Wasn't a gimmick?
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.880]   That was a publicity stunt, let's face it.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:15.400]   It was?
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:15.880]   Did it work?
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:16.240]   Did it work?
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:17.080]   Did you make any money?
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.480]   No, I don't make money.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:21.520]   I just do a publicity stunt.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:24.280]   This is-- you decoupled the money from the publicity.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:26.520]   Yeah, I don't-- somehow, I don't know why.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.360]   It's the point.
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.680]   gdgt.com/news.gdgt.com.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.760]   If you want to follow the news feed,

[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:37.760]   Thank you, Ryan.
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:38.840]   Great to see you.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:39.440]   Thanks for having me.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.320]   Good luck on Tuesday.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.840]   Veronica Belmont is the host of Techzilla
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:47.440]   with my good buddy, Patrick Norton, T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:52.480]   And also of core Q-O-R-E, which is on the PS3 network.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.720]   Yes.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:54.920]   And to be proud of all of you.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.080]   And I'm really looking forward to being at CES
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.560]   and doing some good shoots.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.320]   I'm very excited.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.160]   Come by and say hi.
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:32:59.920]   We'll be in--
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.440]   Of course.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.280]   We'll be in--
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.120]   All S1--
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.560]   Yes, yes, but she never shows up.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.680]   She'll show up with Juan Wick for me.
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.920]   I'm definitely doing Buzz Out Loud to one of those days.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.640]   Yeah, come by.
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.280]   We're there all day Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.720]   doing the radio show, Saturday, and Sunday.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:16.040]   In S1 Hall, broadcast platform one.
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.160]   I will stop by for sure.
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.520]   It's at the top of the stairs as you enter.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.480]   It says so right there.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.120]   Oh, look at that.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:22.640]   Thank you.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.720]   I have a card.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.520]   Thank you, VB.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.280]   Thanks for being here.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.080]   Really appreciate it.
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:27.600]   Thank you.
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.560]   John C. Devorak is at channeldevorak.com
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.000]   and easy diet.com.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:32.960]   Well, there's a rover.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.600]   Somebody stole that web.
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.840]   It's nothing now.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.440]   It's like Squatter's there.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:43.280]   And I'm devorak.org/blog, and you won't get me in Russia.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.280]   You're blocked.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:47.120]   He's blocked in Russia, and he's very proud of this.
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:47.840]   You are.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.480]   We could not let him in Russia.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.680]   He's subversive.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:54.480]   You'll have fascist tendencies.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.040]   You have noticed.
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.960]   You will say we are going to collapse in 2013.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.920]   2010, by the way, not 2010.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.720]   I'm urging everyone.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.920]   And you said there's a reason for this.
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:05.480]   It's shorter.
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.160]   Fewer syllables.
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:10.160]   We've been saying 2001, 2000, 2003.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.880]   But we've gotten a bad habit.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.240]   And if you go to the National Association of Good Grammar,
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:19.520]   nag.com, you will learn--
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.840]   actually, they have a site called 20 not 2000.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.400]   Because what--
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:28.240]   1991, how did you pronounce that?
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:31.040]   19,099.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.480]   The year World War II ended.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.600]   How did you say that year?
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.160]   The year that World War II ended.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.200]   That's right.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:38.560]   So why is it we say 2001, 23?
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.800]   It should be 2010.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.280]   OK.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.120]   Not 2010.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:42.920]   I say anyway, 2010.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.720]   I say, 21.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.800]   So 21's wrong.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:59.920]   20,0, 20,0, 21.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:03.800]   Yeah, I think you're onto something here, Leo.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.360]   Just it's just a little something.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.920]   I consider it kind of--
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:07.600]   Public service.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.400]   A public service.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.480]   You know, I'm just--
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.520]   I'm like Bono.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.760]   He's ending her emiragic fever in Africa.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.520]   I just want people to say 2010.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:19.520]   It's just my favorite.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.360]   We'll have our Elbatross.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:21.880]   We'll see you.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.800]   We're going to be in Vegas starting Wednesday.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.840]   But the road to Vegas begins Tuesday
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.240]   when we pack up all the gear and put it in the Lincoln MKT
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.320]   and start driving down.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.440]   We'll have live streams of that, live coverage on iTunes.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.280]   There's a video and audio feed.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.520]   But you can find out all about that at twit.tv
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.720]   or just tune in live.twit.tv.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:42.120]   Starting Wednesday evening will be at the digital experience.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.480]   And then we're going to go to the Bellagio.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.720]   We're going to some parties.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.880]   Dr. Keke and I and all the gang will be down there.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.360]   And John, you're going to really-- we're going to miss you.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.720]   We're going to be sorry you're not there.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.480]   I'm going to be covering the coverage.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.720]   I'm going to medex coverage.
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:54.200]   I'm going to medex coverage.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.880]   The thing, and I'll probably get more information than you.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.560]   We're going-- no, we're going to the trenches
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.560]   so you don't have to.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.480]   That's right.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.480]   And I'll be covering your coverage and plus everyone else's.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.560]   I'd like you to do that.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:07.040]   All right, we'll see you in Vegas January 6 through the 10th.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.760]   Twit Live at CES 2010.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.400]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.960]   Another Twit was in the can.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.520]   Do the Twit.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.360]   Do the Twit.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.360]   All right.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.280]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.080]   Do the Twit.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.120]   All right.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.000]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:23.800]   Do the Twit.
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:24.800]   All right.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.720]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.520]   Do the Twit.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.520]   All right.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.320]   Do the Twit, baby.
