[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.720]   Fortunately all of you are in studio today. Thank goodness Ian Thompson's here from the register dot code out UK's news director a
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.960]   News editor. What are you? Oh?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.240]   Man of old trays manager
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.240]   I know it's it's been a while, but always good fun to be back and you're reaching your half-century mark
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.040]   Week you're going to the UK to celebrate. Yes
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.440]   I'm gonna gorge out on haggis and black pudding and shortbreads and all the other things that you can't really get over it
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   Jump up and down for Tottenham. Oh
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.160]   More of a rocky bloke myself. Yes. I gather the streak was quite fun. I hear it was yes. There was a streaker last
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.800]   branded streak out
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.560]   He had like something written across his ass like oh, it was I think she had some kind of a thing
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.240]   I remember the good old days when people just streaked because they were drunk and feelings
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.080]   Exactly exactly it's all about marketing now. I would do it, but they can't fit Canadian tire on my butt
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.880]   Schmeiser is also here always a pleasure to have you Lisa Schmeiser editor. I
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:18.480]   T pro today always welcome and I good friend from Austin, Texas first met him at South by a couple of years ago Wesley Faulkner
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.040]   His new lower third is higher him
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.800]   Wesley is a great guy and
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.360]   Is actually your is anyway? We won't say more yes, but it's great to have you. Yes wonderful
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.480]   Great to be back. Yes, I can tell you and I say the last day of the Internet because unaccountably
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.640]   There's a bunch of red dots on the G Suite status dashboard right now
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.640]   And if you go to down detector, which is kind of a I've just learned not the best place to go to find out something's down because it's
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.400]   It's scraping tweets. It's not it's doing slightly more than tweets. It's not scientific
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.880]   They have a Chrome extension too
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.440]   But if you look at the big Google the big population centers in the Northeast and the West Coast
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.960]   Some severe outages something's going on
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.760]   Don't know if it's Google alone or Google's
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.080]   Internet connect interconnect it does it doesn't we bring in down an awful lot of
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.600]   Services like uber and that sort of thing which will lie on Google's backbone in order to work so
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.080]   This message is the only message we have right now from Google
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.800]   This was at about an hour ago our team is continuing investigate this issue will provide an update
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.800]   By 233 which is five minutes from right now with more information about this problem. Thank you for your patience
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.040]   They say we're experiencing high levels of network congestion
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.040]   in the Eastern US
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:49.960]   Affecting multiple services in the cloud G Suite and YouTube and that's how I learned of it because many of our live stream watchers are watching on
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.520]   YouTube blog. Yeah, exactly and the chatroom started reporting this a couple hours ago. They're saying hey, you're down I
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.360]   Want to give a shout out to an excellent piece that Gizmodo's cashmere hill did back in January
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.800]   I cut Google out of my life. It's screwed up everything. Yeah, and she's a marvelous piece of journalism
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.160]   Oh, all of that was fantastic. The series is phenomenal. It was brave
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:20.440]   What she points out is since Google is woven into the fabric of a lot of other third-party applications that when she cuts out Google
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.720]   She also cuts out her ability to navigate without maps
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.440]   she she has base uber doesn't work anymore and
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.640]   So if if Google continues to go down like it's going down right now
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.680]   We don't know
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.160]   New York Times articles don't load people will know
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.680]   By the time they hear the show probably what really happened
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.920]   But what we don't know is if the other services going down are going down because they're using Google's O author
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.600]   They're using some Google service for their backbone or they're using something related to Google
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.160]   You know, this is now such an inter connection with each other
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.440]   It is and this is the same time where Google's trying to consolidate their power with nest and
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.480]   Controlling all those services next is down by the way somebody told me his thermostat doesn't know what the temperature is
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.040]   Yeah, terrifying. Yeah, terrifying. How do you know what the weather is?
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.480]   This is why I don't have a smart home to balance with you
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.680]   I mean well, there's a couple reasons I don't have a smart home
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.160]   But turning over control of my infrastructure to a company that I have to rely on to keep it running is is is up there
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.280]   Along with what are they doing my data? What would we do?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.680]   What would life be like if Google were down for a week?
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.080]   I'm thinking back when I was a kid in 1965
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.640]   The entire northeastern seaboard went dark for 13 hours 30. Oh, yeah power in fact
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.960]   Well, it's never spike in the birthright about nine months
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.100]   Seems to remember the death weight went up to
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:54.320]   There was a story about a kid who had a stick and he was hitting telephone polls and lights went out
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.840]   Just when he hit one telephone poll and he thought for years he caused it
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.880]   Oh wasn't it was an interconnected with similar situation was an interconnect, but
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.080]   That was pretty bad. This isn't like the power going out. We still have lights
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.760]   We have cameras, but I have to think there are people watching live who can't see us
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.560]   We are using Google Docs for our show rundown so we know what to you're not Wesley
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   You'll be the only guy who knows what's going on
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.080]   The rest of us will be going I don't know what's happening
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.200]   So what if you didn't have Google search for a week? What if you didn't have Google Docs?
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.640]   What if you couldn't log into anywhere? What if uber didn't exist for a week because of it?
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.320]   They'll be kind of interesting. Yeah, I think Amazon would be a lot worse though. Oh, yeah
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   Yeah, no because Amazon's also a cloud
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.480]   Number one cloud service in the world right now for all we know Amazon's down at Google just running on
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:53.800]   I feel like be I feel like getting locked out of your consumer accounts would be less impactful than again some of the infrastructure
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.760]   like in AWS or Google cloud or all of the
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.640]   Tools that Google has aimed at app developers
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.400]   I think that's actually worse because that's a layer that you can't see or perceive and that you don't understand how an impact
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.040]   Until it's gone. I think also we've got a slight advantage in that we're all over the age where we got around without the internet
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.160]   We know how to read a map. We know you know, and I do worry with I could get anywhere
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.440]   In the middle of the road you managed it perfectly well before GPS
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.320]   I know but I know I don't know I don't know where do I turn Lisa and I are driving down the highway
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.480]   Arguing over whether the GPS says to turn it the next one or not nobody's thinking. What does the sign say?
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.600]   Yeah, but you see even with then it's just like I'll be I'll be giving my wife directions and get turned right
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.920]   No, not that right the other right and then you realize yeah, okay, it's me
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:48.360]   So I don't know if this is related, but I do remember in 2014
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.440]   August
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:56.480]   12th 2014 much of the internet went down because of something called 512 K day and
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.960]   There has been some concern that we're getting
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.320]   68 K day should happen then that soon in fact it might have happened today. This is a weird
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:14.520]   Problem 512 K day AT&T British Telecom Comcast sprint and Verizon all went down because they're
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.880]   They're BGP router tables
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.280]   Accommodate five hundred twelve thousand addresses as soon as there were more than that
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.120]   Crash
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.680]   This is the same problem. These are older routers. I would guess seven 68 K limit
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.320]   And we are and by the way, you can check. There's a there's a Twitter account
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   That we could check BGP for Dash table. It's only IP for addresses currently
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.400]   778,915
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:50.240]   IPV for prefixes. Oh, so I'm wondering if maybe we hit that 768 K limit and if I don't was gonna hit it early
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.120]   It's Google so you know, it's I don't know. I mean that's just an interesting yeah vulnerability
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.200]   I hadn't really even known about I got a huge argument there earlier this week was someone who insisted that the Y2K problem had been a
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:08.000]   Complete fudge and it was just a computer programmers jobs and it nearly came to blows. It was just like look
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.160]   No, no, it wasn't wasn't a bigger problem is because because everyone pull
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:19.040]   Programmers off the golf course and yeah to fix it. Well, that's mom programs and cobalt
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.320]   It's a good it's a good skill to have at the moment
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.060]   I'm very lucky all her emails are an uppercase, but that's okay. I'm concerned about
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.200]   Bring it back to tech
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.680]   Tomorrow's WWDC right and Apple's doing a pivot to services
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.400]   and
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.520]   This has got to have a cloud
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:51.720]   I don't know positive or negative about the announcement about them rolling out all the stuff and services and how everyone should rely on them
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.920]   If if the cloud is not reliable if Google's not reliable
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.120]   How will they adjust what they're gonna present saying that you can trust us?
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:07.120]   We're always there. I don't know how well that's gonna go. I mean they're presumably they've got some funny
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.320]   I mean they've built the enormous campus
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.760]   They've built the presentation room if they haven't built a decent solid fiber fiber link in there
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.040]   Then they've only themselves to blame but it's a valid point because the more we come to develop on these
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.040]   We come to rely on these services and the more the companies themselves come to rely on them as a service stream
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.680]   These outages are gonna become more and more expensive
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.640]   Yeah, the question I have is one of the reasons Apple's done as well as it has is for quite a while
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.000]   And I want to say quite a while because I'm not sure this is the case recently
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.600]   But for quite a while they had a premium retail experience. I know that recently there have been a lot of we saying overpriced with that
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.040]   Premium can mean so many things
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:54.160]   No, but they were selling the idea of a premium retail experience is very high-touch or a hands-on and when you move to a services based revenue stream
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.720]   What I'm curious about is whether or not Apple's going to replicate this sort of high-touch experience that they've had with customers
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.360]   Or if they're going to go the same way that other services based
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.400]   Revenue streams have gone where it's all here is the FAQ feel free to guide yourself through the FAQ
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.000]   Here is a chatbot you can talk to the FAQ doesn't work
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.600]   Here is the email address that you can send a frustrated email to we may respond in three days in the meantime
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.920]   We're gonna keep auto-charging your credit card $9.99 a month enjoy
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:28.520]   I mean this is something that I feel hasn't been adequately covered whenever any tech companies is where we're launching a service to stream is
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:35.600]   What's your infrastructure for supporting customer relations on that because people are going to want something for their $9.99 a month?
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   Does anybody really run their own?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:46.080]   Cloud 100% I mean I know for a long time Apple was using Microsoft's Azure. Yeah, and then they told folks that they were using
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:53.400]   S3 and Google Compute. I'm just looking at the current iOS security guide where this stuff seems to leak out
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:59.520]   The it looks like this is as of May of this year last month
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.520]   Apple does in fact use Amazon web services and Google cloud platform for some of its
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.600]   Education I think the strength and diversity argument comes in here if you can get anything working on multiple cloud
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.960]   Yeah, I'm multi-homed cloud
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.320]   Yeah
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.840]   And then if everything you know you can always switch one to the other and if all if every clap major cloud provider goes down
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:24.200]   Then we're all bugged anyway remember when they used to say the internet was designed to survive a nuclear attack
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.760]   Nobody says that much anymore
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.120]   Partly because I think it was a pager for right it wasn't really oh no no I interviewed
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.600]   What's his face Roberts about this because well I say interviewed we were stuck in a taxi for an hour and we got talking good
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.400]   Wait, I know yeah, and yeah, they sold it to Congress on
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.080]   Distributed computing so that in the event of a nuclear wall, you know
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:51.160]   We want hope gets taken down it can root around it and he said yeah, no that that was honestly just what we told Congress to
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:58.320]   Any idiot would know that if you detonate a nuclear bomb the EMP is gonna knock out vast ways of infrastructure
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   But a giant hole really sold it to Congress. Yeah, and they heard this I'm just like yep, okay
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.160]   We'll give you the funds to do that it does the internet does route around oh it does
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.840]   Yeah, but you can't route around a nuclear wall there is the scope of the damage it can route around so
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.880]   but yeah
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.800]   Even saying the internet routes around damage you could see things like Google just go down
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.160]   Why isn't it it's not routing around whatever is going on right now? I think Google's just such a monolith
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.800]   You know, it's these large cloud services are so monolithic that it's kind of like the
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.240]   It was at the 1990 telephone exchange that went down at the AT&T outage that went out
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.160]   Just somebody installing
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.000]   Standard upgrade which caused over feedback loop and spread throughout the entire network
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.680]   It's something like that can take out a major cloud or a major telcos network
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.000]   You got to have diversity in there because otherwise you're you're wide open to losing everything
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Meanwhile red dots on gmail calendar drive docks sheets slides sites Google
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Plus is up Google plus is up
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.340]   Plus is up your great optimist
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:08.120]   Tens of people
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.880]   A premium collaboration for enterprise customers
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:17.720]   That's a lot of red dots of the status board and they said they would let us know by 233 is just lucky
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   This is Sunday. This is happening. Yeah. Yeah
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.200]   Well, can you imagine the howls if this room one day? Yeah?
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.040]   Yeah, I mean the outages mailing list is going absolutely nuts at the moment looking at this such a slight I did hear
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.320]   Well, it points out the physical limitations of the cloud
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.640]   I hear a lot of you talked about how the fact is that we haven't had it roll
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.240]   It's not as if one day to center went down and the rest of Google's infrastructure said we're picking up the slack until we can fix it
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.240]   It's gone widespread
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:49.640]   Which means that go someone at Google is gonna have a lot of explaining to do after they after they fix this although weekend is toast
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.720]   Well, actually I heard they even have weekends in that culture
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.620]   Well, I wouldn't have thought so no, it's just like you stack it you stack of people
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.320]   But given the state of Google's contracting workforce at the moment is just like well
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.400]   You're going to pay me a bit more to get it get me out of bed
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:09.180]   Do you think I think people aren't gonna say to Apple tomorrow? Oh well Google was down now you're down now
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.440]   You're why are you going to service? I don't think people pay that much attention now
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.720]   Well, there's a big difference between what tech turn will send to pay attention to you versus I'm looking at the New York Times
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.920]   Tech section not one word about it right now
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.820]   You could understand it Sunday some of us need days off as well
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.180]   It's like every time Facebook has some really bad news
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.180]   They drop it at 5 p.m. On a Friday afternoon
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.500]   Because back in the days of print that used to be a good way to kill a story because no one read the Sunday
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:38.440]   It's Saturday newspapers what it does these days is pays off an enormous amount of tech journalists who decide right?
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.940]   That's tomorrow's you know, well there is no there is no weekly news cycle anymore
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.340]   At this point you would even say there might not even be a daily news cycle. It's it's almost
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.820]   Quarter yeah, I mean unless the news drops
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:57.340]   You know roundabout Hawaiian time then you know, you know, you someone's gonna be reporting it somewhere being
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:02.900]   US China UK whatever, you know, I mean while there's a big red dot over the United States and
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.620]   Some way I'll have to start staying up until 9 p.m. Honolulu time to find out what's going on in the world
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:13.100]   I'm gonna be very cross with you for planning that suggestion. I am not I'm not a morning person myself, so that's
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.300]   That's just let's just check it doesn't look like a measles outbreak at the moment
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:23.220]   Doesn't let's just check apples system status actually some yellows on here, which mean issues
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.940]   Doesn't look like Apple offers a red dot only green or yellow
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:34.740]   They're actually I'm wondering now if it's more than Google documents in the cloud issue
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.140]   I thought back up issue I message issues I message issue
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.180]   So that's let's just check let's click on that link and see
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.940]   Less than 1% of users affected. That's not so significant so
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.260]   All my although Apple it's fewer than 1% I believe but okay, okay
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:57.580]   Well, I think Lee Jim link gmail accounts are down on iOS
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:02.420]   So this is interesting. We'll watch this we'll continue to watch it
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:10.220]   We do want to talk a little bit about WWDC. It's tomorrow apples big event. They cleared the cleared the boards by by
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:16.420]   Ending our long national nightmare after four years of waiting the new iPod touch is finally here
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.420]   Who says Apple has run out of ideas
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:25.140]   They shipped a new Macbook Pro as well
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.700]   Some some before we move on. I just want to show you one. Oh, Carson
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:39.380]   Thing look at those. What are those spikes me? Oh, this is down detector. Uh-huh the spike means these are people complaining about Vimeo
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.940]   Verizon AT&T crunchy rolls Shopify discord
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.300]   Is like a man. Oh my god Pokemon go is down
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:55.380]   Instagram YouTube so those those are tweets complaining about service outages century link Cox EA
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.900]   Seems to be not twitch people are just twitching concourse
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.060]   Read it is just fine
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.460]   You don't use Twitter to find out how things are going
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:13.380]   Do you know when you go on a website and you wait for the the ad slowness slows down with ad words being down
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.380]   I'm guessing a whole entire way
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:21.340]   Int
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:27.300]   Looks like it's got a fraught relationship store. Well, some I'd say night was prime tinder time
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.860]   So, you know, it's tender not every it's
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.060]   Hey, but Google plus is still
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:41.300]   Literally tens of people over now is this volume from people who can't get on Google and so they go on these other services
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.340]   Yeah, Twitter complaints a lot of services Etsy. Yeah
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.420]   Blogger
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.140]   That's a Google service of course even wicks which is not
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:59.860]   Interesting. Yeah, okay. Well, it's Carson break in anytime. Someone's just coming to the boards using that still up
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:06.980]   Maybe use that part of the internet that will survive the nuclear
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.900]   I feel like it's more than Google, but I don't know
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.540]   No, maybe maybe Google is just that thoroughly and matched with everything else at this point
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:21.380]   Something is going seriously weird. My contention is this will be the last iPod ever
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.100]   You can salute it as it sails off into the sunset
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.980]   Why would they waited a four years to update it?
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:35.140]   They updated it with the a 10 processor, which is the same processor in an iPhone 7 three-year-old iPhone and they're just 400 bucks for it
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.380]   They want 400 bucks for something that is
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.140]   Elite as hell. I mean look at the bezels on that thing four inch screen
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:48.580]   Home button no fingerprint no face ID. Yeah, why did they even bother? It's a coupatino idiot tax
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.860]   You know, it's like if you package something up in a pretty enough way
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:57.460]   Certain section of people will buy it no matter what. This is largely apples business model at the moment
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.100]   They've given up on in but something else said if apples doubling down in services. It's important to have a
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:08.180]   Low-cost service device but low cost for a dollar. Yeah, you could buy an iPad for 329
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.660]   Question is did this miss the iPad mini roll out remember that we
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.460]   Everything that was really good. Yeah, everything was coming out. I think you can get an iPod touch for
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:23.220]   299 I would oh you can't get yeah, but I mean, but that's 32 gigs of store 199
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.860]   Yeah, okay, so that's 32 gigs of storage, but it's so 200 bucks is still cheaper than well
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:33.300]   I'm trying to figure out what the use case is for I've tell you what the key use case is if you want to punish a child
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:38.500]   All right, you know slipper is
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:44.420]   I want a life on here it is here it is what's your dreams crumble and die?
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.420]   You know you mentioned that and yet um among the
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.980]   Since I now know a lot of knee biters and their families by by my virtue of having one of my own and
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:59.460]   Typically what happens is the parents passed down their old phones to their kids and that's my contention is first of all
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.580]   I mean they they limit the capability sharply so that the kid
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.140]   Yeah, you just take the sim card out of an iPhone you've got it
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.180]   But that's what all of my daughter's friends have now is their clinic with their iPhones
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.700]   Which are basically tiny devices that can hop on to Wi-Fi to
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.300]   How old is your daughter? She's eight so I'm thinking nine or ten
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.260]   You're gonna give the kid a phone because it's a convenience for parents
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.100]   Because you want to be able to have the kid call you if there's an emergency or if they're
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:29.060]   There are there are devices that they have marketed at that age group where it's a communications device
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:35.060]   Um, we want to do my shake. No, but I have misgivings about letting them onto onto
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:41.220]   Letting them onto the wider internet or to communicate via social media because they're gonna get a lot of robo calls
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.900]   But you just teach them not to answer the can't have that I want them to get a little bit more fluent in human interaction
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.420]   And what's okay and what's not before I give them a device that launches them into the world
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.980]   You can lock it down. I mean you could make sure they don't install apps. They don't have snitch yet on there
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.900]   I just feel like parents more and more want their younger children to have phone access
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:05.620]   They might be able to reach them in some way, but there's I there's actually a kid in our scout troop who has like a wrist
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.540]   Communicate it's like Star Trek. It's a wrist thing where they can punch a button to the important is
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.420]   I've done a couple of stories on those in the last in the last six months or so the security on them sucks
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.780]   Bad that kid will have a phone in six months. I'm promising you
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:26.180]   All it takes is one mystery. I'm also concerned about how those kids are being tracked or what kind of data the places that make these these these devices or offer these services
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.780]   because
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.900]   I've I've sat in on product meetings where basically the minute you mentioned oh, it's a service for parents and kids like the dollar signs start
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.780]   pulsing people's eyes because they're like, oh, I can I can track their data and monetize this and
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.060]   There's no reasonable expectation of privacy or data integrity
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.660]   Well, something that keen to get into your sports the old Jesuit adage
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.580]   Give me a child until the age of seven and then he's your he's mindful. Yeah, yeah father Robert never said that
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:55.380]   Yeah, I know he's actually in fact if he had I would have fired his ass
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:02.900]   It's just a confusing thing about father Robert though because he's he's like he is this Jesuit priest you think he loves to
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.980]   disagree with you, but you make so much sound on his man in heart the Jesuits are
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.740]   The most educated of the bunch right? They believe in evolution
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.740]   They it was a Jesuit that came up with a big bang. Yeah, yeah, so yeah
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.660]   Keep in mind that these do not have qual calm qual calm radios in it
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.580]   And it was developed during dispute. So I don't know if this was maybe that's some sort of test to see how it goes
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.820]   Wesley do you think there will ever be another iPod after this?
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.460]   No, no
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.660]   And the thing is four years from now when it's clear they're not going to update it
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.180]   What are we going to do this is the time we should say thank you ipod?
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.580]   We had a great run
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:43.540]   The first iPod came out. What about 2001 as I remember? So it's been almost 20 years
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.460]   Actually, you give me an idea then I don't think this is going to be the last iPod
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.580]   There's no way apple is going to miss up a marketing opportunity like that
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.900]   They will do the final edition
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.980]   In question with little
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:02.180]   Yeah, they're basically the opposite of MTV which like super 10 history doesn't exist
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.220]   2021 look for the last act part. Yeah, maybe it'll be like those retro consoles that come out
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.540]   Like they'll kill it and they'll bring it back
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:17.140]   One of these tiny PlayStation replicas which carried it was preloaded with like sort of a place
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.540]   He should have ordered the play date. I don't think you can order this yet play date
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.420]   Oh, you don't know about this. We've talked about this last week. This is a
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.060]   kind of retro gaming device looks like a little bit like a Game Boy with a black and white
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.540]   eating screen and a crank
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.740]   and
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.340]   It's being developed by panic who does the best known apple
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:42.020]   FTP program transmit also does some other useful tools like coda and they
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.660]   They're gonna ship this so does that actually powered up or is it a game? No, it's a game
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.420]   It's a input device for it. No, yeah
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.380]   Emergency
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:59.940]   No, that seems like a sensible use for it. Yeah, the idea of the crank. Let me let me see if I get auto play working
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.780]   I guess I'm yeah, as you see crank it this little guy's running across the screen
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.740]   The crank could control it here. Let's just
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.620]   Frank damn it. Okay
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:19.860]   But there we go there they see the crank it the crank it control it. Oh good grief
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:24.580]   You know I say on every time I come on the show I always end up saying this but I really feel like we're moving to a post
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:31.540]   User interface and this more or less confirms that kids coming up through this technology now are gonna kind of expect full body
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.100]   Why doesn't my iPod touch have a crank
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.300]   You have a crank daddy. Yeah
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.060]   Yoda crank daddy
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:47.700]   Anyway, that's gonna be $150 it comes with a game a week for 12 weeks
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:53.300]   And so 150 american dollars in 12 games and then you have to pay more for more games is that it?
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.980]   It will just becomes a dead device 12 games should be enough for anybody
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.220]   No, they're encouraging people to write more games
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:05.780]   Brianna Wu was on last week so she couldn't wait to get one because she wants to it uses lua and she wants to write some games in lua
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.620]   Okay
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:13.060]   I don't I I don't know why I keep giving them a plug for that except that at $50 less than an iPod touch
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.180]   I think it seems like a more desirable device
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:21.540]   I'm just saying anyway. Let's talk about WWDC in a bit fun panel today
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.980]   I'm not gonna get a word in edgewise because we've got Ian Thompson here
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.220]   Lea Lisa Schmeiser
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.220]   Wesley Faulkner
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.540]   We are talking about the week's tech news also a great audience by the way. I guess a lot of people
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.180]   in town for WWDC. We've got people from all over the world from london israel
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:45.620]   Even since an adi and sanose so thank you everybody for joining us today our show today brought to you by
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.500]   a cloud service
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.700]   I'm thinking they're not gonna check their op-el no check if they're up go ahead with sabi.com
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:59.140]   I guarantee you they're up with sabi is hot cloud storage. They've re rethinking the whole
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.420]   idea of what cloud storage could be it comes to us from david friend and jeff flowers
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.100]   I've known david for a long time they've come up with a way to save
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.700]   80% on your cloud storage costs to increase the speed 600%
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:23.700]   uses the same s3 api you're used to but costs a lot less plus there's free egress they never
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:29.060]   charge you for egress maybe you should be thinking about wasabi it's just as secure actually
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:34.260]   probably more secure than on-premises storage hip a compliant finry compliant cjis compliant
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:40.500]   very very reliable and very affordable I love this immutable storage idea
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.740]   this is such a brilliant idea you can designate some of your data or all of your data if you want
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:50.740]   untouchable this is what you need in this day of an age of ransomware or and or fumble
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:56.260]   fingered employees that data can't be changed move stuff up to the cloud where it'll be safe
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.860]   forever never have to worry about getting charged for egress or api access and are you ready for
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:10.180]   durability eleven nines eleven nines 80% cheaper six times faster eleven nines of durability
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:16.340]   immutable storage redundant data centers and they're up right now maybe this is a good time to go
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:21.780]   to wasabi.com they have a free one month unlimited storage trial for twit listeners you have to
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.700]   click a the free trial link and use the offer code twit to get that
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:31.140]   w-a-s-a-b-i dot com please use that offer code let's them know you saw it here
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:36.980]   I am really a fan of these guys I've known them for years and I know they're doing something
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.620]   really exciting and I just want the world to know I want I know you're gonna have three names in
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.500]   your list I want you to add with Sabi to that list w-a-s-a-b-i dot com and you can try it out
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.420]   unlimited storage with the offer code twit for the first month.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:56.500]   Boy let's just check the google. I think it's exactly the time to be promoting
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.140]   smaller cloud providers. I think my my have a real opportunity here yeah that that big red
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.460]   dots getting bigger. Oh wait they're up in Toronto now too. Yeah Canada has been suffering as well
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:16.420]   that looks like South Detroit so it's Winnipeg. I think this is honestly an artifact of
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:22.740]   the way down detector works because it's all it's all urban areas but clearly there's an issue if
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:30.020]   we go to the Google status board let's just refresh that still red dots next to almost everything
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:38.020]   except Google plus and now Google said that they were going to tell us something they so far no
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.460]   word about what's going on. There must be deluge with people going if you try turning off an
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:53.060]   ome again. It's an interesting story and some severe outages all over the world right now
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:58.500]   but we don't know why and we don't know if it's just Google to be honest. I noticed you know as we
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:06.180]   said system issues with Apple as well. WWDC is tomorrow Apple will announce all these great new
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:14.660]   online services you won't be able to use. They'll also announce we think iOS 13. Yeah with exciting
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:19.300]   new volume control. I wonder who. Yeah and dark mode that's where everybody gets excited dark
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.940]   mode. Our chance right now supports. Yeah so that's interesting you think they will offer iPad
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.260]   Pro mouse support. I mean it's rumored last well I have to say the first time I was on this show I
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:34.500]   think I said that it's gonna the the new iPad Pro is gonna be the platform for their next MergeOS.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:41.220]   I agree with it. This is moving closer and closer to that being a reality. They said I mean the
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:46.980]   rumors is that it's for accessibility but when you have keyboard support supported,
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:54.420]   mouse support supported, merged apps on the desktop. The parts of Pym will let you put your iOS apps
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:32:00.260]   on the desktop sometime soon and so and you can use it as a second display possibly right so yeah
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.260]   you know what hastened this in my opinion is the failure of Intel to provide Apple with the chips
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:09.460]   they needed. Apple's that just made Apple think even harder about moving to their own chips.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.860]   That's what they're doing on iOS. They're having great success with the chip development there
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:20.420]   that a 12x bionic is amazing. Yeah well also they're going to be buying up a lot of Intel's IP in
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.300]   the modem area and yeah because it's just getting out of the five exactly so I think once I've
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   what the the feedback we're getting at the moment is that Apple settled with Qualcomm
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.980]   signed a five-year deal. Intel's getting out the business Apple buys Intel's IP that gives them a
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.460]   five-year start start developing their own kit so they can own the entire supply chain all the way
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:46.980]   down the line. Intel did say interestingly that their decision to get out of 5G did not predate
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:52.100]   the Qualcomm announcement once they heard the Qualcomm announcement they basically said let's
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:57.220]   get out of this business. Well I mean this is the Apple Apple we I think we even heard this in a
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:03.220]   previous lawsuit Apple actively forced Intel they pressured Intel to do 5G modems because they
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.780]   wanted to get out from under Qualcomm once that was settled Intel said all right you fine you take it
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:14.340]   and but I have to I wonder what the future is about Intel right now I mean I feel bad for Intel.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.260]   They just they're a one-trick pony at the moment. Yeah AMD's eaten their lunch for left and right.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.580]   So they're getting eaten on the on the server side on the desktop side they no longer have a mobile
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:28.900]   play. I mean they've still gone 97% of the data center market but they've said that I mean Brian
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:34.180]   across and before he was forced out. All he said you know well you know we'll be happy if we can keep
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:40.500]   you know 80% and that's critical what are the critical features of the data. What are the
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:45.300]   critical features of a data center low power yeah distributed computing the ability of a red
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:50.500]   multiple threads in a single processor without specter and melton. Right right.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:57.700]   So that's security. Arm seems like it could make an offer. Linus Torvald said one of the problems
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:03.220]   with developing arm software for Linux and arm for Linux is most of the time when you're running
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:09.780]   in the cloud you're going to running on x86 so but that's interesting maybe maybe you won't be maybe
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:14.580]   you will be running on arm in the cloud in the future maybe the whole future is arm from apple on
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:19.380]   down. Arm has a problem still scaling out they can they're scaling up but they can't scale out
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:25.300]   right now. So multiple cores on the same like motherboard is still a problem right now so they
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:30.500]   have to fix the interconnect problem before they can actually really run super efficiently in the
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.140]   data center. Are they working on that you think? I'm guessing. I mean keep in mind also AMD has an
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:44.020]   ARM license so a variant could be coming from them of like a low power server. Yeah I mean actually
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:50.900]   Intel's got the grunt but that's really about it and they've really sort of dropped the ball I
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.700]   think they've had cobalt problems with the manufacturing process and getting down to seven
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.780]   nanometers and everyone else is so far ahead of them now that all they've got to rely on is the
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:03.460]   x86 market which is it's a reliable you know money spinner but they're still spending a lot of
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:08.180]   money in the graphics business too trying to see if they can and their AI chip is a joke.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.340]   But some of these chips are insanely expensive you know when you're talking 20 grand for a single
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:20.020]   processor that's yeah I can't see that as a sustainable business model it's just kind of like
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.660]   Apple and iPhone pricing. I think this is overall going to be a good thing for Intel it's going to
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:30.260]   make them stop really yes absolutely because I think they've spread themselves way too thin trying
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.820]   to do all these things. Well I do remember the last time Intel was really challenged by AMD
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:42.260]   they were able to come back they went to the Israeli stunt works and said what do you got guys
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:47.300]   because x86 is you know this we just we got to keep x86 going this titanium project they're
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.980]   working so well yeah the old time yeah ultramas eating their lunch yeah and so they were able to
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:58.260]   fortunately find an x86 architecture that worked for them and they came back and I started that's
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:03.060]   when tittok really started really pushing hard on that so they have responded well to that kind
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.940]   of pressure I think they do and they have enough cash to be able to say let's scrap whatever we have
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.820]   and start over and they could still I mean not start over of course but they could still
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.020]   they probably have I'm just saying. You could make the argument gray raven in our chatroom is
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.620]   though that Intel makes the best possible buggy whips. That's a very good analogy on my
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:26.980]   steeled ex-fights. They are buggy. They are buggy. And then maybe the age of the buggy whip is
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:33.060]   over yeah except for a very small specialist market where you can charge $20,000 buggy whip.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:38.580]   Yeah I have to think that arm if they can solve these issues like the internet issues are going
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:45.220]   to be able to take over. And you got to admire apple who has it's not just arm they have an
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:49.620]   arm architecture license but they bought PA risk they have literally thousands of chip
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.740]   designers working under that roof they want to make every chip that goes in there. They want to be
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.980]   vertically integrated. That's their goal. Always has been their goal. So I have to.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.220]   It feels like the execution is a lot smoother under Tim Cook but this is a guy who made his
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.900]   supply chain guy. Yeah I was saying this guy made his bones on supply chains and ensuring
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.380]   that the trains are out. And then the elephant in the room is what's going to happen with the
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.300]   domestic Chinese market when it comes to developing their own silicon because whether they're the
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.540]   ongoing trade war at the moment they're really ramping up spending in we need our own pro we need
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:24.580]   to be processor independent. I don't want to laugh but remember that Foxconn which of course is
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.860]   suffering a lot of tariffs because of the trade war we're having with China. So they moved a number
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:38.420]   of their factories to Mexico. Yeah and now of course trade war with Mexico. And now I don't know
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:42.340]   you know what's interesting is none of these companies ever think about moving their factories
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:52.020]   to the US. Actually Foxconn's supposed to go in Wisconsin. No. Have you seen the local reporter
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.420]   who's been going around being banned from the Foxconn campus because he keeps on
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.340]   finding these empty offices with tape over the window. How much money did they get from Wisconsin?
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.620]   It's like 60 billion dollars. It's the equivalent to think about half a million a
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:08.500]   dollars per job under the original specs but they've since cut down the number of jobs so that's
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:15.780]   gone up somewhere. I think it was six billion. Yeah. Oh yeah the reporter John Dezayza from the
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:22.740]   Verge. Yeah that was some lovely repulsion. He went around looking. This is all he found in Wisconsin.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.380]   It was a model of a Foxconn plant. Last summer Foxconn announced a barrage of new projects in
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:35.460]   Wisconsin so we went looking for them. Subsidy package of 4.5 billion. And then they went to say it
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:42.500]   was going to be LCD panels and then no we can't do that. No absolutely we will do LCD panels after
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:51.060]   a call from Trump. Yeah. People say a lot of things. Yeah but when we as taxpayers are paying for
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.980]   these people. Well this is the thing is if you're a if you're a if you're a person who lives in
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:59.620]   Wisconsin you should be incandescent with rage over the fact that this is revenue that could
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.500]   have gone towards bolstering your school systems or your roads or mitigating the effects of more
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:09.620]   severe weather and instead what's happening is a multinational corporation based outside the US
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:16.900]   is is reaping the benefits of your of your tax dollars. It's so but they have a new governor
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:24.420]   so things could be changing. Yeah a lot of women got elected to state assembly. Shout out to Jody
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:31.780]   Emerson. There are tons of changes that could hopefully restructure the still so taxpayers
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.580]   aren't going to be out that whole sum. It's kind of reminds me of the sort of the sort of hunger
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:41.380]   games. The thing that Amazon paid for their you know for their headquarters. It was just like
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:45.940]   bend over and show us how far you will go before we will dain to come to your city. Dance for us
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:52.740]   monkeys. Exactly. It's just this is the richest company in the world and they're demanding subsidies.
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.380]   It was so clever of them to just collect all of this data on all of these cities because now they
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:02.740]   can take a look at secondary and tertiary lines of business and they already know hey if we want
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:08.980]   to set up something that has to do with industrial IOT these are the cities that have the best talent
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.140]   bases and already have existing third party vendors where we can coach their talent if
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:20.340]   they're currently planning on building out and hiring out in Kentucky which is where FedEx is
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.100]   located so you know there's going to be a big battle of talent there since FedEx and UPS both
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:29.140]   have huge presences in Kentucky and that's a hub for a lot of shipping. I mean Amazon now has
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:35.780]   data on how many cities? Yeah and they just give it up. I mean Northern Virginia always made sense
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.540]   because that's where that's how you service your government clients. There's all the federal cloud
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:44.340]   contracts that come out there. New York, well in New York made sense and
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:50.180]   you know the name is like well if you don't want us we'll just take our ball and go home and the
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:55.060]   truth is it's not going to hurt them that much to leave the center of finance and fashion because
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:00.340]   there are other parts of the world where they can get the same benefits and the same access to talent.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:07.140]   Yeah. But there are other cities throughout the US that have access to really specialized
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.180]   line of work whether it's agriculture. You know for example Illinois has Caterpillar their HQ is
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:18.340]   there. It's downstate from Chicago but Amazon now has a lot of data on Chicago so they can go back
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.340]   and it's not just that they can use the data from other cities against the other data.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.860]   Other cities were saying we're getting a better deal or they're like the bachelor.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:33.860]   Yeah exactly. I had my one-on-one date with Boston. They offered me access to academics but
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:42.420]   can you offer? Yeah so at WWDC one of the bingo slots you should reserve is the end of iTunes.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:48.500]   This is all rumor we don't know what Apple's fire. iTunes was running on Google Cloud so that's
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:56.580]   why. It's already apparently over. Apple when iTunes was good. No you know. Oh no when it first
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:06.180]   was a podcaster we were very grateful when I was. No no I have. The first couple of iterations
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:10.660]   of the software it went around the office and okay downside everyone could see what your music
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:15.940]   collection was. It was pretty embarrassing out on that one but it was actually a pretty good system
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:21.700]   and then they jiggled about with it and just piled stuff onto the core. But they do this with a lot
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.860]   of their apps because their context app at this point where you manage all of the people in your
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:31.300]   phone and in theory in your email address book that's another thing where they just keep lay
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:36.900]   around craft and it's fundamentally unstable and there are sync problems between all of your devices
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.820]   and or your accounts. So this rumor wouldn't happen until
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:49.140]   iOS or sorry Mac OS 10.15 comes out which is probably in the fall but we don't. It may be not. I mean
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.180]   that's why I don't think it's going to be an announcement at the show because then they're not
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:58.660]   going to want to ease us into this and gradually validate it. Maybe they'll do the Mac OS update
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:03.620]   sooner because if they depends when they ship a Mac Pro. Presumably they would do it with the
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:09.300]   shipping of a Mac Pro. Yeah they cleared the deck for other hardware with the Mac Book Pro last
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:16.020]   week the iPod touch this week. So if there's going to be a hardware the theory being if there's
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.220]   going to be a hardware announcement they want everybody to focus on it and it fits in anything
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:23.700]   it's got to be a Mac Pro. I guess it could be an iMac Pro but it's got to be a Mac Pro. They promised
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:30.180]   that two years ago. You sure it's not just an updated cube? That would be depressing. The question
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:36.500]   is with Intel missing their targets will the Mac Pro trust it. Mac Pro traditionally runs Zions.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:45.300]   There's no is there a 7-man PC on? No there's no no no no 10-man PC on but it's got a lot of
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:51.060]   cores it's really a different beast for not for you and me but for people who want many many threats
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:58.580]   for video rendering or 3d design. They have said all along it will be modular which that was the
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:03.940]   problem with the last Mac Pro. By the way the last Mac Pro was announced in 2013. Oh good.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:08.100]   2013 they've been selling it to this day you could still buy it. I don't know why you would.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:14.100]   So but there you know maybe too little too late for the pro community. They may have all moved to
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:19.700]   this you know Dell precision workstations as what we did for our video editors some years ago.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:25.300]   But I think if we see it if Apple doesn't say something about a new Mac Pro tomorrow maybe not
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:31.060]   that it's shipping next month but if they don't say something I think that's the kiss of death for
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:35.940]   pros and maybe you're right Wesley when you said Apple's moving to the iPad they don't care and also
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:42.900]   AMD already has their graphics business. Would it be a shocker if they saw that Intel was slipping and
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:48.660]   then they moved to the Ryzen processor Ryzen and Pro's. Because they've never done Nvidia they
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:53.620]   like radiance. Yeah that would be interesting. It's a shocker. Yeah I'm putting out there first
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:57.940]   so if in case it happens you heard it from me. But you know that Wes and Buck really knew what was
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:05.460]   going to go on. So so that the only reason I bring that up is if they're going to get rid of iTunes
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:12.580]   if it's not if they're not releasing a new Mac and a new Mac OS to go with it in the next couple
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:16.340]   of months you're right they're not gonna say anything about iTunes yet. But the other thing
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:21.860]   it is something that grudgely gonna start sort of squeezing out and shutting down. So the rumors
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.780]   and there are a lot of them including Mark Gurman at Bloomberg who's usually very accurate are that
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.820]   they're gonna make three new apps. Music, video, podcasts. Some said that they were gonna take
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:36.500]   iTunes and put it in a folder. But because you can't get rid of iTunes without completely
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.420]   replacing its functionality. People use it right now to back up their iOS devices. What are you
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.980]   gonna do if you can't do that? Maybe music is just a rebranded iTunes. You know what I really miss
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:50.740]   on iTunes is I miss the ability to go and rearrange all of my apps on my mobile devices and I don't.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.540]   You can't do that in iTunes anymore? No. You can drag and drop things on your phone or on your iPad.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.780]   At least it now remembers the arrangement when you moved to a new phone. It used to be you had
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:04.020]   to redo it each time right? That was a real pain in the bed. I still I like to have I like to be
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:08.340]   able to open up things on my computer screen. I have to say organize and that's like I am so
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:16.420]   done with Apple. I am just I feel like I'm overcharged, underserved. I think Mac OS is great for
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:21.220]   developers and designers and pros but you put Linux on a good PC and you certainly have many
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:25.300]   choices of PCs these days. You're going to get much of that same functionality. Maybe not for
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:29.380]   the designers and the videographers and the photographers. I don't know what they do. I guess they use
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.500]   Adobe on Windows. What about a mobile first ecosystem though? What do you think? Well that's
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:39.220]   what Wesley is saying with iOS right? Yeah. And I have to say Lightroom on iPad Pro is kind of a nice
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:44.980]   combination if you have Lightroom on a desktop and you have that USB-C port also. So yeah. It's
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.460]   really awesome. I mean I come at this from a little bit more of an enterprise perspective
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:55.780]   since that's our core audience but when I'm taking a look at the products and the markets that big
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:05.620]   guys like Microsoft and IBM and Google Cloud and the rest and collaboration companies they're
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.620]   all aiming for what they call first line workers now. These are people who are not traditional
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:14.820]   desk workers. They may be people who either are in industries like construction whether on site
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:19.780]   or they may be retail workers or they're healthcare workers and almost all of these companies to a
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:24.100]   person are pushing a model of computing that is mobile first where a tablet is your primary
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:30.820]   is your primary computing interface. And so we're seeing you're talking about the Mac Pro and it's
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:36.180]   kind of surreal to me because I'm like that's almost a completely different direction than it seems
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:41.300]   like the money and the attention. If anybody knows that better is Apple knows it better than anybody.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.660]   They're the ones who sell it. They know the numbers. Well this is the weird thing is
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.940]   because I remember the first one to an Apple store and they did everything over an iPad. I'm like oh
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:53.620]   it's the future. But it wasn't. It was this amazing hardware that had an antiquated operating
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:48:00.980]   system iOS. So maybe if iOS 13 will be more. But I really do feel like we may be moving to as jobs
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:05.780]   get much more siloed in a lot of ways we may be moving to a model where mobile computing works for
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:12.180]   significant percentages of a population both on a personal and a vocational level and the number
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:16.980]   of people who really need a desktop to do their job that will stay steady or it will decline over time.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:20.820]   I think that works only as long as people are still working at desks because the big
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:26.020]   failure of the tablet for the fact is well no I've tried various different tablets. I've got it
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:30.340]   in your life. I've got it. Yeah you can't do it on the train. Yeah. You know it's you've got it.
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.340]   You've got it unless your fingers are up around there and people look it's just a very bad look.
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.260]   You actually you what's really funny is the muscle memory because I do take iPads to press
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.900]   conferences now and I've got like an iPad keyboard. It's a lot easier for me to do it that way.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.700]   And then when I move from an iPad keyboard back to a regular one I always have like a few minutes
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:52.340]   of really disturbing type of this. There's still that. But I've also seen reporters who now just
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.820]   have a pencil and an iPad pro like they've got the digital pencil and iPad Pro. You can write your
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.980]   stories from now on. They do. No. They they can write the notes and then they press a button and
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:05.380]   it's typed up. That's it's the future. But then you've got to go through and edit it again. You know
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.780]   it's kind of like it's it's one of those things that sounds great. It's like the front page. Give me
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:15.940]   copy. Oh my god. You read the story. I'm telling you we have a lot of companies that are now pushing
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:21.060]   people towards a mobile first computing model and the question is whether or not it's going to hold.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:26.260]   I'm just not going to go mobile as developers who really need a keyboard to sit down. And honestly
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:31.060]   you can't develop for all these great new apps for iOS unless you have a Macintosh that you could
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:37.060]   sit down at if nothing else. If Apple even says all right photographers bye bye. All right editor
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:42.580]   video editors bye bye. They're if they've got to have people writing software for iOS. Maybe the
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:47.860]   thing to watch for tomorrow is an announcement that Xcode their developing environment moves to iOS.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:53.380]   That would be that would be huge. That's the day right when that happens. But is the experience
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:50:00.820]   going to be I don't want to do it. Yeah. That's a risky move because like you said that the hardware
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:06.260]   hasn't been there for so long. And if you pair that with a subpar software experience with
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:13.060]   something that just doesn't seem to quite get to where your old hardware you already have is not
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:18.340]   there is that because we're old timers though because I agree with you. I feel like I want to
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:23.060]   I want to keep I want a nice keyboard Apple's not doing that right. I want a nice screen. I want a
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:29.860]   big screen. Maybe you want multiple screens right in big screens. But I also and whenever I use an
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:34.260]   iPad I bet you feel the same way I feel like I'm I'm kind of compromising. I like have to work
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:39.140]   extra hard to make it work. Okay. You're forcing yourself into that paradigm that's not natural for
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.460]   that. But then I talk to young people who say oh no it's fine. I love it. Yeah. Well you know you're
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:52.900]   also talking about programming. Yeah. I don't know those people. By the way Google Plus is still up.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:51:01.060]   There's your show title. Google Plus is still up. It is. Google Cloud Search. Everything else
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:07.220]   is not looking good as we look at the map of issues and Google has yet as far as I could. No update.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:14.420]   Have they said anything? I'm waiting for they promised us we'd know something and it's just a
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:20.580]   bunch of red. It's also spreading through Europe now. It's not it's not getting better. It's getting
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:27.140]   worse. It actually looks like it might down detector is having less complaints. It looks like it might
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:34.020]   have already spiked. Oh or nobody can get online to complain. Oh that's. Yeah. Yeah. We saw Australia.
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:38.260]   I would think if they have found some sort of mitigation and they're trying to
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:43.940]   remedy it then you would have posted an update. Yeah. If they had something somewhat positive
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:52.820]   they would have said it so strange. So strange. Yeah. Yeah. Does look back to WWDC. We may not be
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:59.220]   talking about WWDC at all tomorrow. One thing we haven't talked about is the watch OS. All right.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:04.420]   Let's take a break and come back and talk about watch OS. You're wearing an Apple watch? No. No.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:10.660]   No. You're wearing an Apple watch. Okay. I'm watching a Samsung watch. You're at the naked wrist. Yes.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:17.060]   I'm a theoretical construct for Ian. Just like sometimes I've got a vague idea what's going on.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:21.780]   I don't really want to be told oh it's 10 to the hour you know it's time to go up and yeah.
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:28.820]   Here is Google's statement. Thank you to Mike B and our chatroom. Our engineering teams have
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:33.620]   completed the first phase of their mitigation work. Mitigation of what they have had said and
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:40.900]   we are currently implementing the second phase after which we expect to return to regular service.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:47.220]   Right. Okay. Well here you go. I thought the first phase was just going.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:50.180]   We're all doing that. It says we'll let you know by 4 p.m.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:59.060]   They aren't saying at all what's going on. That's really interesting. She's really good news for
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.180]   Australian so because they're going to come into the office on Monday morning not be able to do
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.380]   any work and write right okay break up in the tinnies and let's go out and you know.
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:09.940]   So we've had this problem before when they push configuration changes that work but that screwed
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.780]   things up so it's probably not an external attack. It's probably an internal good.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:18.820]   Okay let's hope that's the case. I could tell you one thing they're doing right now at Google and
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:25.460]   all over the world firing up thousand eyes to see what the hell is going on. Thousand eyes is the
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:29.700]   way to see what's going on in the cloud. Everybody wants to move to the cloud and then these things
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:35.140]   happen and you're going what are we going to do and the problem I think any any cloud engineer
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:40.260]   will tell you you can know everything there is to know about your infrastructure the stuff on
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:45.620]   premises the stuff you own but the minute you go out to that puffy little thing that's why it's a
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:51.060]   puffy cloud on all the diagrams it's a black box. You know your data goes in it doesn't come out
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:58.260]   what's going on you don't know and that can mean you lose control of your cloud app or your service
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:03.300]   your customers are hollering at you you're scrambling to find the root cause you're losing revenue
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:10.820]   employee productivity is going down your brand may even be damaged. What if you could see into that
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:16.100]   cloud what if like a squeegee cleaning a dirty window you could suddenly see the entire service
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:21.220]   delivery path from the cloud right to your end user including all the stuff you don't own
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:28.420]   you don't control down to the local coffee shop. That's thousand eyes an amazing story thousand
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:34.340]   eyes was created at UCLA and immediately received funding because these guys had something that
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:42.420]   no one else could do they put sensors everywhere on the internet more than a thousand eyes they
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:47.860]   should really call themselves million eyes a massive array of vantage points on spanning the
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:54.820]   global internet cloud providers local Wi-Fi this is an old school i.t. monitoring which is passive
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:55:02.180]   and siloed this is unique you get a path visualization technology that extends beyond any boundaries
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:08.500]   suddenly you can see you can understand and you can fix the experience for all your apps all your
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:14.980]   services and websites if you don't have thousand eyes today is exactly why you need thousand eyes
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:19.860]   regain control ensure the best possible digital experience for you your customers your employees
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:25.460]   make sure you're in the right cloud thousand eyes has some great white papers on clouds and how
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:30.660]   they work and how multi-home clouds can be a good thing or a bad thing how you can connect to the
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:36.100]   right sass instance and how you can see issues before they impact your customers employees top
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:41.140]   banks enterprises sass companies the world's largest and fastest growing brands rely on thousand
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:46.180]   eyes to do the cloud and do it right you should two thousand eyes dot com slash twit

[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.300]   wants to move to the cloud but you got understand what you're getting into and this will make it
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:06.980]   all clear and then say to the boss and by the way boss we need thousand eyes go to thousand eyes

[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:18.420]   thrive in a connected world we thank of so much for supporting this week in tech we thank you for
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:24.100]   using that special address because that helps us when you go to thousand eyes dot com slash
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:31.860]   twit watch why are you so excited about the watch Wesley why what's exciting about the watch um
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:38.980]   the health health care um they're severing it from needing to have an iPhone which means that
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:45.940]   they can give it to more people i didn't know and the oxygen air in category so that they don't have
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:51.700]   to they can just send them watches so i'm wearing i didn't bring my phone but i'm wearing a galaxy
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:57.460]   s3 frontier watch which does go on the internet goes on the wi-fi but its utility is definitely cut
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:02.500]   because it needs a phone to do the work in the apple watches even more so right right i mean
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:06.580]   you could stand up but other than that this has always been the big weakness for you in
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:10.180]   smart watches is that you've got that smart yeah but you've got to have a phone with you
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:15.380]   which case just use the phone right um there's side cars they're not motorcycles yeah
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:19.940]   buying plus okay apple did make a very pretty one but the early android i tried out the early
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:25.460]   android ones and my wife named named one the woman repeller i mean it was just a huge lg block on
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:31.060]   your wrist and it was terrible things but on the health care thing yeah yeah they're gonna be selling
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:36.980]   them bulk now shipping them out to to people i mean i will say i swim so this the watch is handy
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:41.460]   for swimming in a way that the phone is not right um so you can't bring the phone in the water no you
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:47.780]   can um you and uh for things like kayaking things like um anything anything where water is involved
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:54.500]   which admittedly is not a majority of people who use it for health related things um i'm actually
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:59.140]   really interested with the doses app that they are rude to be coming out with that reminds you
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:04.100]   when to take your medication because again like you said that hits that hits a market where
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:09.620]   as they can put on their wrist and then it's time to take your afternoon pills time to take your
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:17.380]   pm pills i hope it tells you where your pills are also um so so there seems like that but yeah i
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:21.940]   mean i i love my apple watch but i will agree that i made your weakness in the user experience is
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.780]   that it has to be coupled to a phone at all times there are rumored to be three new
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:31.700]   uh apps coming with watch os6 again we'll hear about this presumably we'll hear about this
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:38.020]   tomorrow you mentioned one dose uh which will and by the way if you have uh an
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:42.420]   an iPhone now it'll download automatically to your watch you'll get it there's also cycles
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:49.220]   which is a menstrual tracking app um by the way Fitbit and Garmin already do that
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:55.300]   yeah and the store and then there'll be a story where you that's going to be the key isn't it
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:59.140]   yeah separating the watch from the phone if you can app app download and install apps from the
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:07.620]   watch directly absolutely yeah um calculator voice memos and books you'll be able to buy books
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:11.140]   and listen to them on the watch that's actually kind of cool right now i have to copy it it's kind
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:17.220]   of labor is copy my audiobooks or music over to the watch then it'll play but i have to make sure i
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:22.500]   do that before i leave home yeah that's a you know apple should double down on the watch the watch is
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:28.260]   arguably a big part of any services is going to offer it's a big they barely make a lot of money
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:34.260]   on the watch it's not selling uh watch not just smartwatch but selling watch out there and with
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:40.660]   its own store it might actually also be another source of revenue in terms of advertising and so
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:44.740]   we get to the point is the technology advances it'll become coming back to what we were saying
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:48.500]   about kids in the iPod touch they could just wear a watch and just give them a watch you know they
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:53.060]   can't get well you could get pornography on a watch i guess but you're not gonna you could look it down
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:58.100]   yeah it's really hard to do the downside to someone that the thing is and and again this
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.500]   okay i feel like i have to keep caveat that i love my watch but what i'm really uneasy about
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:10.900]   is i don't know what data it's recording regarding me or what gets sent back to apple or how that
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:17.220]   remember apple uh at ces this year bought a big right what happens on the iphone stays on the
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.540]   iphone on the very other cell ironically you notice they didn't put the subtext unless you're in china
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.820]   which case you screwed or unless you install any apps washing and post this week it's the middle
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:34.660]   of the night do you know who your iphone is talking to our privacy experiment showed 5400 hidden app
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:38.420]   trackers guzzling our data in a single week a lot of it in the middle of the night this is
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:45.940]   jeffrey fowler writing uh lots of apps some of the apps you know obviously if you have uh one drive
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:52.980]   it's got a phone the home office into its mint yeah spotify okay even the washing and post own app
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:58.980]   ibm's weather channel app one app which is oh has always been a little skeezy if you ask me
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.540]   citizen citizen was the app that's supposed to scare you i know something who's just actually
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:08.660]   pulled that off it'll terrify you because it tells you all of the police action near you i don't
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.540]   know he it was a it was a pain to work with the chap because he's just like
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:16.180]   every 10 minutes or so just like oh no someone's being stabbed on the air with
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.940]   our mission and seven is clearly because it's mission and seven it doesn't
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:26.020]   terrify you uh but apparently citizen shared personally identifiable information in violation
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:31.540]   of its own published privacy policy we trust app developers to adheres their privacy pal
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:38.660]   oh what's amusing is this week google actually um had a blog post where they were like oh by the
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:44.260]   way from now on we are making any browser plugins tell you what data they're collecting and what
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.100]   they're using it for and give you thank you and they were trying very and and they're trying to
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.660]   put it's about time we care about we we are making your we are making our third party developers
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:57.620]   care about your data but it again it seems like a little bit of a run around where google can say
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.540]   we're not really the problem here the problem is the third party developers and again apple has the
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.900]   same cover of plausibility where tim cook can talk about how privacy is is a fundamental human
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:13.300]   right in value but look at what's being sold and look at what's being offered in apple store
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:18.260]   and look at the complete lack of enforcement i talked to phil Zimmerman the creator pgp
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.820]   he said i will never carry an android phone i always carry an iphone but he said very important
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:28.660]   don't install any apps on it because while you might be able to trust apple you can't trust anyone
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:34.020]   you can't trust anybody else and we know facebook we know all these companies the their total
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:38.900]   goals to get on your phone because then they have information about you your location what you do
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:45.300]   they can sell to other people no in this i don't mind i accept that when it comes to basic privacy
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:50.740]   apple is better than android in some regards but i just hate the this marketing campaign
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:55.540]   we're all about privacy we're about your day to be and it's complete rubbish right you know it's
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:03:00.020]   like we didn't want the market you're not you're not you're not in no way more secure and if you're
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:04.100]   in the far east then you're less secure why does it take a reporter to find this out how come
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:09.060]   apple is not doing the same testing yeah exactly well apple i would guess apple
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:14.660]   knows yeah but it's not fair to somebody else it's not to mention it's possible tonight oh it's
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:18.100]   not us it's it's the same thing with came general it's because i knew about that for two and a half
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:22.660]   years but to be fair apple it's something called me the radio show asking about this apple does
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:27.860]   allow you to go into the settings and say don't let this contact is home office but you yeah for a
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:32.020]   lot of these apps that be useless if you can't if one drive can't see what's on your cloud or
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:37.300]   right spotify can't download music you're not going to be using it yeah and wasn't there a story
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:42.900]   few weeks ago about how there's some things you just can't see you because it's locked down
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.300]   the iPhone it's the iPhone yeah well that was one of the stories was and this had this went back
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:53.220]   to the Israeli firm that was right responsible for putting a snap not what's what's it what's
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.540]   up yeah they were they allow people to hack what's up with a phone call not even a
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:03.380]   pick-and-phone phone call phone call what's up oh yeah on the iPhone and so a that's problem number
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:08.180]   one is that you may have a perfectly secure iPhone you put what's up on it suddenly it's
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:13.940]   it can be owned easily yeah and then the problem came up a lot of security researchers pointed
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:18.260]   out because of apple's restrictions the way it's locked down we can't tell if it's actually
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:22.420]   almost impossible to tell if an iPhone has been compromised right because you can't get into it
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:26.420]   i got in trouble at work for refusing to install what's happened put it on my phone because somebody
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:31.940]   wanted to the boss wanted to what's up you yeah yeah and i said i'm sorry i just i don't put that on
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:37.540]   my my per i was like i don't put it on my personal device and good for you and you can reach me VSMS
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:42.980]   but the people in the room looked at me like i had two heads and i was like it's a security
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.900]   threat why would i knowingly install a security threat for someone else's comfort and convenience
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.900]   no office millennial was trying to get me into snapchat and so i downloaded it and looked at the
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:55.220]   world the kind of permissions it was looking for is i don't really care that much about dog
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:05:00.420]   face filters you can see how you look as a woman don't you want to see as you look as a woman
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:04.260]   honestly i probably wouldn't be very pretty so i can live without that no they put makeup on
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:10.900]   you the funny thing with that snapchat filters were all beautiful um yeah talking about privacy i
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:16.980]   don't know if we're done with the story but if we go into this story but it dovetails dovetails
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:22.980]   into what's also on the rundown about amazon echo being able to say delete that's something new
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:27.300]   they're rolled out today the ability to say delete today's recordings or last week's or last
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:32.580]   week's but what what Lisa was saying about plausible ny ability is the same thing in a different way
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:37.540]   that amazon's doing where they're putting all the onus on the user yeah you have to continue
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:44.260]   remember to say remove this data or don't opt into this data or do this research into each app that
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:48.820]   they say that they that's why their system is the best is because they care they check every
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:54.740]   i have a theory on this i think this is in the in the wake of gdpr and privacy regulations in
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.580]   california and elsewhere this is what you're going to see is all these companies say oh yeah we
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:03.700]   completely agree that's why we've given the user the choice right yeah and they know because they know
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:08.660]   from their own experience that the most users tyranny of the default users are just going to use
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:13.300]   whatever the default is so they they actually have it both ways they they look like they're giving
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.980]   you lots of choice they're doing lots of control of privacy apple does that
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:21.220]   it fact it even says you know this program's been using your location in the background you
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:26.420]   want to let it continue and most people say well maybe in that case they'll say no but i think in
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:30.900]   most cases people just say fine yeah and these companies know this google knows this facebook
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.660]   knows this one of the actually design their a couple of couple companies have been finding
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:40.900]   europe for so-called dark patterns you design your website to push the user into certain
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.940]   parts of of doing things and certain default settings and this is actually illegal under
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.020]   some stations european law although do they even know if it's a dark pattern because it's a good
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:54.580]   dark pattern you don't even know well true yeah so i think we're going to see this become an
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:07:00.820]   emerging story because like you said the california the ccpa goes into effect next year and california
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.260]   proves yeah the california consumer privacy is a strongless law in the united states well here's
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:08.900]   the thing because california uh now consumers have will have the right to corporate disclosure of
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.100]   how their personal how their personal data is being collected in use so they have the right
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:17.460]   to disclosure but it doesn't specify how it's disclosed they'll have the um consumers will have
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:21.460]   the right to access the personal data that has been collected by companies they'll have the right
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:25.460]   to request that the personal data be deleted they'll have the right to know how companies have
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:31.460]   been sharing their personal data but the scope of the law is actually kind of limited because the
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:37.060]   company has to earn more than 25 million a year in revenue for and there's incidentally no punishment
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:43.300]   it has to make and this 20th this company that makes more than 25 million a year in revenue has to
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:48.740]   has to make at least 50 percent of its revenue from selling personal computed data so if you're
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:53.620]   company like amazon or microsoft or apple it's probably not going to affect you because you can
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:58.820]   say plausibly it's a very tiny these were all later amendments made to what was a very strong
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:04.100]   privacy law and then these companies came in and said well let's change that let's change that
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:09.380]   most importantly let's eliminate any punishment yeah and then go ahead pass your law and that's
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:13.060]   the dark pattern yeah that's what you're going to see time and time again is these companies paying
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:19.540]   lip service to privacy yeah while in fact people aren't going to have the choices or they're not
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.060]   going to you know they're going to be pushed in the wrong direction and like you point out Wesley
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.900]   once again it's going to be the onus is going to be on the people to figure out how to do this
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:31.620]   basic rights fine fine they hit email but they have to find and send new requests and just out of
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:37.300]   curiosity i'm not familiar with this law does this include government sources of personal data
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:44.100]   that's interesting so like that like uh red light cameras or any other information that they scoop
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:49.220]   up on you i don't know that's a good question i would love to see what the local government has
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:54.820]   on me like yeah so every time a toll tag is hit all that stuff because that's all personal yeah
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:09:00.820]   i think the the other issue is that while many many companies are collecting data on you it has
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:10.020]   been up to now siloed but increasingly it's being distributed sold it's going to data brokers who
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:15.060]   are then selling it on other parties amalgamating it and as it gets added together they build a
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:19.540]   ultimately perfect picture right of your behavior like the morgue scandal where they
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:27.700]   disapole these exactly just like see it just kind of depressing the best minds of the
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:31.460]   computer in computer science these days aren't working on the big problems that we're
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:35.140]   here have to sell us cheap tax they're working on the big problem how to make more money
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:42.500]   yes yeah that's the big problem why would they not work on that you know the adage you know you
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:50.180]   you you improve what you measure and there's not a really good that's so good index to make sure that
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:56.660]   um we haven't made a privacy index measurable yeah and make it public and make it so that everyone
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:03.620]   is focused on that yeah it's a really good plan yeah um no this i think the eff does try
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:10.260]   to do that but yeah i think it's uphill if consumers don't care it's uphill yeah i won't
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.340]   mention his name but someone at the eff told me they've actually got on whiteboard in the office
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:19.620]   number of days since facebook's last privacy failure it's constantly having to be great
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:28.740]   so i'm reassured everything's going to be fine because apparently the FTC and the FCC and the
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:34.580]   Department of Justice have divided up the tech world and they they have said who they're going
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:40.340]   after latest is Department of Justice is now picking up the dropped FTC investigation of google
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:46.180]   they dropped it in 2013 they're going to start meanwhile the FTC has been given amazon
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:54.100]   uh to to look into and so they've they've kind of divided the world up like spain and Portugal
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:58.900]   divided the world yeah they're going after these individual companies but we also saw the FCC
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:05.140]   issued approval this week for the sprints uh t-mobile merger because then the DOJ said no yeah
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:09.060]   but i mean if there's one thing the US needs is more competition i think i think there's
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:13.220]   government dark patterns i think this is an example of a government dark pattern well they're
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:18.420]   saying oh don't worry the DOJ is going to handle that right the FTC is going to handle that we got
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:25.860]   it under control the FTC established to that a special task force to monitor tech and competition
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:32.420]   there's a special task force one of the challenges i think you're going to find in a lot of the federal
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:38.260]   government is exactly how tech literate or tech fluid they're going to be right well i think i think
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:42.580]   that's your starting point right there is because if you've got although there's a revolving door at
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:47.300]   a political appointee level if you're talking institutional knowledge exactly
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:57.300]   but this is also sounds like a classic administration move where they could separate this out and for
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:03.140]   running for the 2020 saying we have we're doing we're doing we're taking and then at the same time
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:08.420]   talk to businesses and say hey don't worry about it that they're able to have have it both ways by
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:14.180]   separating it out like this yeah exactly right in fact in the face of california's privacy uh bill
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:19.220]   i think it was marco rubio who said no no no there shouldn't be state privacy because there'd be 50
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:24.660]   different rules we'll take care of this we're going to make a federal privacy law and then that
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:30.020]   was that yeah there's very interesting that was private you can't see it was very interesting
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.820]   after the camera journalism scandal broke a lot of tech companies shifted their position for years
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:38.900]   they've been we should not have a national privacy law that should be down to the states
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:43.460]   and once they realized the scale of the mistakes that have been made it was kind of like okay let's
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:47.940]   go to national law we need to google is the largest lobbying spender in the out of the entire tech
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:52.580]   sector they're just like okay we need a federal law we've got the lobbyists we can get exactly what
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:58.020]   we want and as you say we'll push it all onto the user and job done if you're a tech company do you
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.940]   want to be out in front identifying the problem and running the legislator that writing the
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:06.660]   legislation that you give to your pet lawmakers to pass or do you want to be on the receiving end
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:10.420]   of legislation that your competition help craft here's the yeah this will tell you this is the
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:16.260]   press release from marco rubio's office rubio introduces privacy to build to protect consumers
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:24.980]   while promoting innovation that's the key yeah promoting innovation uh i think that you don't
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:31.780]   have to worry that the uh federal privacy bill the american data dissemination act see this is what
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:35.940]   sounds by the way like it has something to do with contraception that's what i mean i want
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:41.380]   it's just coming from a republican american dissemination act that actually sounds like if it's
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:46.820]   dated dissemination it sounds like you're rounding rounding things out of it disseminating from big
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:53.620]   donors yeah it's it's going to get back to get back to eons i believe says rubio any efforts to
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:58.340]   address consumer privacy must also balance the need to protect the innovative capabilities of the
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:03.300]   digital economy that have enabled new entrances small business you know i can't disagree with him
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:07.060]   if it's anything if it's any entity in this country that's been poorly served it's corporate
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:11.940]   america yeah but i mean it's so full of weasel words in dog americans that's the big two
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:16.740]   it's so full of of sort of weasel words in dog house that it could mean anything we need to look
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:21.460]   at the legislation itself and instead we're getting press releases about trust us it'll be great i
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:26.180]   just know i sort of feel like if you want to see where a company is going to go business wide wise
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:30.260]   take a look at what they're advocating for now when it comes to national policy
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:35.540]   um for example i feel like it's kind of noteworthy that microsoft has been leading the charge on a
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:40.260]   lot of things like data privacy and facial recognition because my question it my question
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:43.460]   my question is well if they're advocating for these really specific standards that do these
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:48.980]   really specific things what's the down line yeah and so that's what you should be asking
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:53.540]   anytime if tim cook is like oh privacy is our premium um but what's the down line what's the
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.780]   let me ask this because senator warren and a number of other presidential candidates
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:05.460]   for 2020 have said we should break up amazon facebook google do is that a solution seems to me
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:10.900]   that's no draconian in the other direction it's just the same with walway um naming
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:17.620]   companies and then saying we're going to go after them does not fix any future problems you have to
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:24.020]   figure out what the problem is it's not those companies it's the that's that's maybe an example
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:29.060]   and whoever's eyes that that's where the problem is but outline what the problem is and come up
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:33.700]   with a solution for the problem because let's say you kill all these big companies or you kill a
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:39.940]   walway how are you going to tackle the next problem without having some sort of way of describing
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:44.100]   what the problem actually is would breaking up amazon solve anything when it comes to either
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:50.340]   facial recognition technology use or data brokering or would you just have a smaller subset of amazon
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:54.900]   that's now devoted to selling facial recognition recognition technology i don't know part of me
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:59.380]   would like to see facebook the sort of facebook instagram whats up thing broken up into separate
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.820]   companies because it's kind of getting like at and t but at the same time i don't see a real
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:06.820]   benefit for it yeah but at and t came back together yeah i know that's the thing and also what's the
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:12.740]   benefit for the marketplace if you break up facebook like what what who who is being hurt by the
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:17.060]   competition i would make an argument that breaking up google isn't such a bad thing i
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:21.540]   bothered me when google got into the content business when google was a search it seems to me
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:26.420]   a search engine should be a search engine yeah still advertising that's fine but when you acquire
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:31.380]   youtube and maybe they're not maybe they are but there's always been the accusation favoring
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:37.300]   youtube content and search that is a problem and so and there's no reason google needs to own
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:42.340]   youtube there's no there's no synergy there except an advertising and privacy invasion synergy
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:48.740]   so if they got rid of youtube if they got rid of i mean maybe the moon shots you have to keep
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:52.900]   because who's going to fund that if you don't have deep pockets you're not going to waymo's not
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:58.020]   going to make any money for years verily not going to make money for years project loon
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:04.580]   loony um i don't know i i think there are things you could do i would love to see
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:10.260]   regulators safe youtube but what is the what is the thing that you're fixing yeah you're
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:14.580]   fixing here's the thing you're fixing you're fixing search for one thing because
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:18.180]   when search is compromised in fact even larry page said this when they first
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:24.340]   wrote the first papers about page rank they said we should never take advertising because no matter
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:29.060]   what if you do it's going to taint your search results shouldn't there be instead of break up
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:35.060]   or separate shouldn't be like you you cannot do this with search or excerpt well that's another
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:40.900]   way or just like find a way to define that fully exactly what is wrong instead of just targeting
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:48.260]   them because it doesn't fix when twitch and amazon become the next behemoth in terms of content
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:54.500]   and search it's the combination of multiple entities and the synergy and this is why they
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:18:00.500]   bought youtube for three point two billion dollars the synergy of all these videos we know what you
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:06.180]   like tying into google and google search and google advertising that's that's to me that's the
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:14.100]   incentive for surveillance so if you just sever if you sever the pool of information on one person
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:18.100]   doesn't that fix the problem yes that's another maybe that's another approach it's a more sensible
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:22.820]   approach it's awfully hard to do that since all of that information is flowing inside that company
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:26.500]   but if you say that now it's the same or if they separate them it's too different that's true they
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:33.380]   could still circulate it yeah uh i agree with you i mean i think that it would be more sensible to
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:37.380]   pursue privacy protections than it is pursued break and of course that'll be
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:42.100]   yeah for the user to figure out i think if you i think if you well i think actually if you were to
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:47.540]   pass legislation that forced companies to assign a dollar value to data yeah you said measurable
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:52.580]   things get results and companies do assign dollar values to specific users when they
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:56.420]   package your data and move it on if you force that information to be public for publicly traded
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:02.340]   companies i think that that kind of transparency give lawmaker something to hold on to and start
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:08.180]   moving forward i think this is what people regard people really moving on gdpr was just like okay
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.020]   it's another privacy it's not the privacy law but then when she looks hang on they can take four
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:16.180]   percent of our revenues yeah we can't even use hollywood accounting to just do it on profits and
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:21.780]   pay nothing that is a real stick that is a hell of a point yeah yeah and that's where they got five
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.820]   billion out of out it was just friends that went after google right
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:30.740]   uh yeah that's a new one yeah yeah and they're also going after apple for prompt planned obsolescence
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:35.140]   and they may well be going off to google for that because just worry with all this stuff uh doesn't
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:39.700]   at this point at some point what is the company just go screw it
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:47.940]   god can't i have at my workplace i'm required to take a privacy rights um online course every
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:53.460]   year okay um this is petri who is this no i work for informa informa like my my publication is owned
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:59.380]   by informa which is a really big research and industry events and publishing on and we have to
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:03.300]   take it and because it's funny because i'm not really worried about informa stealing my information
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:09.860]   they sell a lot of it though i do they and the thing is um because part of my job involves writing
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:14.980]   producing editing and sending out email newsletters i have to be oh yeah conversant in what the
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:19.780]   private list yeah i have million lists and since i'm not responsible for administering those
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:23.940]   million lists but because i do use them i have to know and in the privacy training i have to go
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:27.540]   through every year they're very very careful to say you can't send out this kind of email in
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:32.100]   germany because of germany's privacy laws you can't send out this kind of email in australia's laws
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:36.660]   and so we do have a case where globally speaking different people have different experiences based
[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:42.420]   on their country's uh conception of what online privacy is or a tribute actually shut down all
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:47.460]   european traffic it was just like yeah yeah cut them off yeah that's the other that's the o screw
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:52.340]   adoption but i guess the question is londonism perusians not giving up to get that daily news
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:59.060]   in chicago oh no i can't read from but here's the thing is is even you know the even the thing is
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.820]   it's not like the company i work for shutdown operations in germany or can never make money in
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:08.260]   australia they just have to do it differently and i think sometimes we tend to conflate um making
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:13.620]   money easily with making money period when that's not necessarily going to be the case you have no
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:20.100]   right to make it easily yeah is we've got to point now where the attitude is oh why would we
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:24.900]   want to put obstacles in a way of innovation and profits and companies when the question should be
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:31.620]   instead why aren't we it is a battle look at what apple did apple after losing in the supreme court
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:38.020]   and it's uh the the issue is going to be whether they could be sued or not as a monopoly by consumers
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:43.220]   the spookert said yes consumers do have standing so that lawsuit will forward apple's response was
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:50.740]   to create uh a what do you call this a advertising page propaganda a propaganda page yes absolutely
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:57.460]   absolutely dedicated to the best store experience for everyone what a number of people pointed out
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:03.860]   is that apple really this whole document just really underscores apple the fact that apple does
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:09.620]   have a monopoly yeah it's our store and we take responsibility for it and we charge you 30 percent
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:15.060]   no no defense says but you're gonna love it because it's our store look you're secure
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:23.300]   we review apps we reject 40 percent of all apps we give developers a so but this didn't answer any
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:28.900]   of the issues uh that i think people were raising about the abstract monopoly but this is one of
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:34.020]   these investigations these legal cases are so useful because you know their apple responds to their
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.580]   legal problems with this we've just seen facebook is going up in court is that going to is going to
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:42.900]   try and literally argue the case that you have no expectation of privacy because you use facebook
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:48.180]   that's just a lawyer's i know it's just a lawyer's thing but it knocks on to their public image
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:52.420]   yeah people reckon and this is why apple's doing this kind of thing you gotta see a major pro
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.220]   would ever make you think you had any privacy on facebook
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:01.220]   would you have thought that i mean you've got me nearly famously came up with the you have no
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:05.220]   privacy get used to it uh thing but i always remember when the Snowden archives came out he
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:12.980]   actually tweeted wow i didn't know quite how right i was i don't like being right
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:20.980]   um we will also see the most important story i think tomorrow and by the way our
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:28.740]   coverage of the keynote begins 10 a.m pacific that's uh 1 p.m eastern times 1600 UTC you could watch
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:35.140]   if google isn't down at twitter.tv/line actually yeah we probably won't put it on youtube because apple
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:40.100]   has a for some reason yeah some aversion to us streaming its conferences on youtube so we'll
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:44.900]   stream it everywhere else uh but what we do is commentary on it which as far as i know is still
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:51.460]   allowed in the free world oh yes they found out way to block you yeah believe me they try
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:55.780]   uh so megan maroney and i will comment on that today and one of the things i think everybody is
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:24:02.900]   so excited so excited dark mode and ios now let's really talk about it real news here okay the real
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:10.500]   news yeah like i said what is it with people in dark mode Wesley i don't know why i asked you
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.820]   as a representative melanin i guess i could speak on this subject
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:25.380]   it's it's not as harsh on the eyes example but yeah you are pretty easy on the eyes Wesley uh just
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:30.340]   the also it saves tons of battery power yeah that's the real reason on the phone so old led screen
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.580]   you wanted dark just the software change and now they can boost numbers just generally speaking
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:40.340]   on all their devices uh i thought i thought it was really interesting adam angst uh tidbits wrote
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:48.420]   a story on actually the fact that dark mode's bad for your eyes um well you do need more like
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:53.700]   technically more light means your eyes don't have to work so hard vision research has shown humans
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:25:00.420]   prefer dark on light because that's the real world yeah you're out there in the sky and the sky is
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:04.900]   bright in the sun and stuff humans evolved outside were generally active in the daytime would go to
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:12.100]   sleep when it's dark we like to be able to see things um and so a lot of research says that dark
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:19.220]   mode is in fact not as good i would like to see this see how updated this is in terms of the studies
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.900]   i think in general yes but it feels better to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:30.880]   in front of screens where the knit value is a lot higher than they have been ever.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.220]   It's like you're staring at a speck of the sun – exactly.
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.220]   Exactly.
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:36.700]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.740]   I believe that was the case.
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:45.820]   But with the screens and how they're pushing out all these photons, I think maybe it's
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.900]   maybe not the case anymore.
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.120]   It's certainly more comfortable for the eyes.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.540]   I noticed when I've been using dark mode for awhile.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:55.780]   And then I go to a page with like this, which black text and white screen.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:57.420]   I go, "Ah, my eyes!"
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.420]   It's actually quite useful.
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:04.220]   I wouldn't say the real use of dark mode is if you're angry, it was the middle of the
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.220]   night.
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:11.660]   Because if you turn on a non-dark mode screen, it blasts your eyes and the brain's just
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.300]   like, "Oh, it's daylight, wake up."
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.620]   Whereas in a dark mode, you've got a much better chance of being able to just sort of
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.060]   start an important right-game.
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:22.500]   But maybe the right thing to do would be to turn your screen down.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.300]   And use light mode.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:28.660]   But just to have a less dim or a screen.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:30.740]   I don't know.
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.900]   We do know that all the blue in the screens is keeping people awake.
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:34.900]   Right.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:41.020]   And all the notifications that's also one of the updates that we skipped over about having
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:42.020]   like sleep mode.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:45.460]   Am I really the only person who turns off notifications and almost all of her apps?
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:46.460]   No, that's the new thing, right?
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.020]   You won't get notifications anymore.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.020]   Sleep mode automatically turned off to do not disturb actually.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:54.260]   Notifications turned off on my app on the phone almost all the time.
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.260]   That's the key to me.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:58.100]   And that's what I do is I'm going to do not disturb all the time.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:26:59.100]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.900]   And then that way the phone isn't bugging me.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.380]   And if I can look at it and see what people are saying.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:07.460]   But I also try not to look at screens really half an hour before bed.
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.540]   But you also have a watch though, right?
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.540]   I do.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.340]   And I put it on theater mode at 10 o'clock at night.
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:13.340]   Okay.
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:14.340]   Wow.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.340]   Wow.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.340]   She's serious about that.
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.340]   Well, I am dead serious about sleep hygiene.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:22.500]   And I think as long as you as long as you set down the boundaries for yourself, for your
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.980]   light look, no notifications, put the watch in theater mode so that even if you're moving
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:33.300]   your arm around, it doesn't act accidentally activate and give yourself, give your brain
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.740]   about a half an hour of not looking at any screen whatsoever.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.740]   I think that is important.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:38.740]   That's why that last half.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.740]   Throughout the buffer.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:43.500]   I am going to introduce a new feature on this weekend tech.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.140]   Alexa, delete everything I just said.
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:48.740]   We're just going to say that every five minutes.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:51.540]   Well, this actually raises a.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.180]   So I told you before the show started that we recently cut the cord.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:59.660]   We no longer get cable and we use Apple TV for everything now because all of our streaming
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:03.460]   services can be accessed through Apple TV.
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.420]   So there's a lot of Siri group.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:07.660]   My daughter loves doing the Siri.
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:09.700]   We went on 25 seconds and watch another scene.
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:10.700]   I love that.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.700]   I do that all the time.
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:12.700]   Here's the thing.
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:17.580]   Now how to find out what series microphone policy is.
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:19.300]   It's ambient listening policy.
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:24.860]   And this could be coincidence or this could not what I have noticed in the few months
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:29.460]   that we've been going through this Apple TV as our primary TV interface and our only
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:35.180]   IoT device in the house is my search engine auto fill results have been uncannily tied
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:39.940]   to the things I've just been talking about and is creeping me out.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.940]   So I'm glad that Alexa.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.380]   I hear this a lot and I have to think that mostly it's coincident.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:48.700]   Well, I'm trying to figure out like how much of this is me looking for a pattern that doesn't
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:53.420]   exist and how much of this might be me observing a pattern that I'm not supposed to notice.
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:57.660]   Am I the only person that finds it really creepy that you've got to give Alexa a command
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:58.660]   to say this?
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.820]   Why aren't they just deleting this stuff by default?
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:02.820]   Oh, because it's not there.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:03.820]   But the first time.
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:04.820]   Well, it was not.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:05.820]   The first time.
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:10.100]   It's like human beings just like consumers are supposed to recycle their end waste as opposed
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.380]   to as opposed to the corporations that generate the crap have a good recycle.
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:15.140]   Just like you accept those cookies.
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.140]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.140]   Every website you go to.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.140]   Every website.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.860]   It's one of my favorite T-shirts from Defcon is Jesus is coming delete your cookies.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.740]   I never thought of that.
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:31.020]   We had a fun time this week on Twitter and we've I believe prepared a short movie to
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:35.380]   demonstrate what fun we had.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.380]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:39.140]   Oh, there's the alert.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.180]   Turn it at warning for the next 15 minutes.
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:42.660]   Paul, I would take it.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.660]   Take shelter, Paul.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:46.620]   Yeah, but come on.
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:49.300]   I'm going to say and then they get.
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.300]   What am I?
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.740]   Well, which is on them?
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.740]   Windows weekly.
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:57.580]   We will today cover the new windows.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.100]   Windows modern.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.580]   All about Android.
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:08.300]   Walmart is now selling its own trio of branded Android tablets who said tablets were dead.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:09.860]   hands on tech.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:14.620]   The Pixel 3 a XL costs roughly half the price of the Pixel 3 XL.
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.780]   So how do they compare?
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:17.780]   You like regulation.
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:22.540]   I like all of the history has shown that massive villains get abused.
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.140]   I can't detach myself from my face.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.500]   You know, at least a license plate reader I can get out of a car.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:33.980]   We have never seen a technology this powerful being trusted to those with police power over
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:37.580]   our lives to it home of the Flowmaster.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.020]   It's cute.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:40.020]   Former home.
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:41.020]   Flowmaster.
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:47.580]   We interrupt this program for a special announcement.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:50.500]   This will be my final Gizfiz show.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.500]   What?
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.500]   Nearly nine years here.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:54.500]   Alex Gumpel.
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.700]   Who's the weight?
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:57.700]   The Flowmaster.
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.700]   I hope you could fix the audio.
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:02.700]   I hope you could fix the audio.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:09.500]   Get to accidentally misspell an elf again.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:15.300]   Alex has been with us practically since it started.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.960]   He came almost straight out of high school to work for us.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:23.140]   He's going to work for a como in Seattle as a professional TV engineer.
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:25.760]   So we're very proud of the Flowmaster.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:26.760]   Wow.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.620]   Thank you for your years of service, Alex.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:32.940]   Our show today brought to you by Eero.
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.780]   I love my Eero at home.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.300]   Eero is the smartest Wi-Fi I've ever had.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:40.540]   Wi-Fi was easy when you had one or two devices.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.020]   Your neighbor didn't have Wi-Fi.
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:44.100]   You weren't trying to stream Netflix.
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:47.780]   But these days, the single router model just does not work very well.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.940]   And you're probably all experiencing what I was experiencing at home.
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:54.660]   Honey, the internet is down.
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:59.800]   After about the 18th time I heard that, I decided to get an Eero.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.360]   And I have to say, it's awesome.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:05.960]   The best analogy is it's like a light bulb.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:08.880]   Wi-Fi does not go through walls very well.
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:14.120]   So if you have a lamp in your living room and you hope it will light up your bedroom,
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.480]   good luck.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:19.520]   With Eero, you have lamps all over your house.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:23.200]   Eero beacons, which bring the Wi-Fi closer to you.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.940]   It's essentially what the enterprise is, including Twitter, have been using for years
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:27.940]   now in your home.
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:30.360]   An enterprise-grade mesh Wi-Fi system.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:31.360]   And it's so easy.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.360]   It's not complicated to install.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:35.460]   You install the Eero app on your iOS or Android device.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:39.380]   It'll walk you through the process, help you place the beacons.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.700]   Depending on the size of your house, you might have one or two.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:45.720]   We have five base stations in our house because it's a big place.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:49.380]   It's about 1500 square feet per unit.
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:51.440]   And then the Eero app lets you manage your network.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.000]   In fact, I love Eero Plus.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.640]   I can have, in fact, we do.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:58.960]   We have our 16-year-old's Wi-Fi turn off at 9 p.m.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.000]   Time to go to bed.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.120]   No more Minecraft.
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:08.160]   We also have our devices stay up as late as we want because we're grownups.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.440]   State of the RWA2 encryption.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:14.200]   There's a guest network, which is great, so you can let guests have access to Wi-Fi without
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.920]   getting onto your network.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:20.000]   And the most important thing these days for any device that's on the internet in your
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.560]   house, especially the router, is automatic over-the-air updates.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:29.120]   Eero updates automatically, so you not only have the latest features but the latest security
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:33.560]   at all times, and they do updates fairly regularly, which is fantastic.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.120]   If you ever have a question, their customer support is amazing.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:39.920]   30-second response time, and they will stay on the phone.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.200]   I know they stayed on the phone with me till they fix the issue.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.280]   Eero Plus is well worth the small amount of money it costs.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.160]   I use it for everything.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:53.800]   It protects my network against malware, spyware, phishing attacks, unsuitable content.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.240]   I could block it across the entire network.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:00.160]   By checking the sites you visit against the database of millions of known threats, Eero
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.960]   Plus protects you from accidentally visiting malicious sites without slowing anything down.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.240]   Violent, illegal, or adult content tagged, you can decide who sees what, whenever you
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.240]   want.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.760]   $99 bucks for a year is well worth it.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.240]   I love the Eero Plus.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:20.120]   Right now, we had a great deal, $100 off the Eero base station plus two beacons and a year
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.120]   of Eero Plus.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:27.000]   $100 off when you go to Eero.com/twit and enter the code TWIT at checkout.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.520]   E-E-R-O, Eero.com/twit.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.320]   Don't forget to use the offer code TWIT.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:34.680]   You'll save $100, and you'll let them know you saw it here.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.960]   We really love our Eros.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:37.960]   You will too.
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:41.440]   I like it so much that when I got the new Eero, I sent the old one and my mom set her
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.960]   up because she was having Wi-Fi issues.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:44.960]   She's got a great system.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.160]   And I can even go on my phone.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.960]   I would if I had it, but I left it at home.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.000]   I can even go on my phone and see what her network's doing.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.640]   I can see what her router is.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.640]   I can see.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.640]   I can control it.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.280]   It's wonderful.
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.440]   Even when you're away from home, E-E-R-O.com/twit.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.760]   Don't forget to checkout code TWIT.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.840]   Thank you, Eero, for your support of this weekend tech and for continuing to give us
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.120]   a great product updated all the time.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.400]   Latest update from Google.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.520]   Google Plus is still up.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.760]   Gmail, not so much.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760]   YouTube.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.760]   Although I see some people in the chat.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.760]   People in the chat are saying campaign to try and force us back onto it.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.760]   Maybe.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.760]   You want the internet?
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.760]   We've got it.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.760]   It's called Google Plus.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.600]   Yeah, this is what Facebook was like.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.720]   It's still big red dots.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.120]   I don't know what the lag time is on down detector though.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.800]   It might be significant, but it looks like frankly it looks like it's getting worse not
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800]   bad.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.720]   It looks like a measles map if the anti-vaxxers got that way.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.880]   Yeah, this is the old flu map that Google used to do.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.400]   I'm making fundamentally vaxxers and never gets old.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.440]   Just let some of that get some.
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.440]   Ooh!
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:52.440]   Oh!
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:53.440]   That is smiling.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.440]   Oh!
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.920]   Wow, the snark that the register.co.uk is so very famous for it.
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.280]   That's a good joke.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.320]   I have to remember that one.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.320]   I just got it.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320]   It's very contagious.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.320]   Bravo!
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.320]   Bravo!
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.160]   Oh my goodness.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.440]   Let's see, what were we talking about?
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.640]   I don't even know now.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:22.160]   I would like to talk about Microsoft being a possible candidate even though it said Amazon
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.600]   for this fourth wireless carrier.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.640]   I like to plead the case of why Microsoft is better than Amazon.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.680]   So we should explain the backstory here.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.000]   Of course, T-Mobile and Sprint planning to merge.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.520]   We mentioned earlier that the FCC said you go right ahead.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:39.520]   The DOJ say whoa!
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.080]   You don't need to get a better.
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:45.400]   But the real issue I think for everybody is it's good to have four different wireless
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.880]   carriers and four major wireless carriers.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:52.760]   If you only have three, I as a T-Mobile customer want them to merge for Sprint.
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.960]   As a Sprint customer, I want them to merge for T-Mobile.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.960]   You especially, it doesn't get better.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.960]   So the plan is let's make a fourth carrier.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:00.960]   Yep.
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:01.960]   And you say that the candidates are there.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:04.840]   They're talking about shearing off booth mobile.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:05.840]   Right.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.000]   And having that being spun off, but it needs to be acquired by a company that's large
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.360]   enough that can compete with the other three.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.880]   It's boost mobile.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.880]   It's not an MVNO.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:19.280]   It is an MVNO, but it would be like a license to the spectrum to the same airwaves.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.400]   So they would still they would have dedicated access for a certain period of time.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.960]   And then eventually the company is big as Amazon or Microsoft.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:26.960]   They'd build out their own.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:27.960]   They'd build out their own.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.800]   And they'd acquire their own licenses to in order to compete.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.760]   And there's an article on the rundown about how Amazon is possibly thinking about buying
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.880]   it and getting into the space.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:45.440]   But Microsoft is a better fit because if you look at what was in that highlight reel about
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:51.840]   Microsoft's modern OS, how they're talking about how portability is part of the new future
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:58.720]   of seamless updates, bug fixes, so on and so forth, for the laptop space, being able
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:03.080]   to sell something that comes with cellular access would be an advantage.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:10.800]   And also Microsoft is one of the only big players in gaming that has not come out with
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.360]   a handheld.
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:19.640]   So Sony has so is Nintendo, but Microsoft has not.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.880]   And they're absolutely right up there with the 10 on Sony and the games.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.880]   And if you're talking about streaming games, which they're leaning into with their X cloud,
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:37.200]   they're gaming cloud, that would also be able to, you can lower the power, but you'll need
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.000]   that connectivity and the speed guarantee.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.880]   So that is why I think that is Microsoft should buy them.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.080]   And plus have they made noise if they want to buy them?
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.040]   Nope, they have not.
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:50.480]   They're coming a burnt in the mobile sphere off to.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.480]   They did.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.000]   That's also another good thing.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.920]   They'll be able to have they'll also have they'll still be in the portable space, but
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.320]   they'll never be and they could be the backbone.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.320]   Right.
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.320]   Instead of actually being the one that is a major player.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.800]   Couldn't Google do the same with Project 5 just expand that out?
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.800]   They could.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.800]   That's a good.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.160]   And that's an MVNO running on Sprint and T-Mobile.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.040]   Yeah, unless they're seen as a competitor.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.520]   Oh, and a US cellular.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:19.200]   So actually Google is kind of kind of has a finger in all the pots.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:21.200]   Damn, maybe Google is by boost.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.560]   Yeah, do you really want Google?
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.280]   I think their partners might not like it.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.600]   They make Android phones.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.600]   Yeah, that's.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.600]   So many Android phones.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.080]   That's an anti-trust stick to beat them with as well.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.080]   Yes.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:38.640]   Microsoft still has an issue with RDP more than one million computers vulnerable.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.000]   Yeah, Rob Graham did some good research on this.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.480]   This is a an exploit that affects remote desktop, not in Windows 10, but in prior versions of
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.000]   Windows.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.320]   And they call it Eternal Blue, because every exploit has to have a name.
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:57.120]   Thanks to Grossie, the dog for that name.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.120]   Yes, it was.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.480]   And I think he'd be watching a lot of Game of Thrones that when he came up with it.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.360]   I also think Eternal Blue is a callback.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.360]   Oh, no, hang on.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.520]   That was the NSA name for it, wasn't it?
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:05.800]   No, yeah, the NSA was--
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:07.120]   I was thinking Bluekeep, yeah.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.120]   Sorry.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.120]   Or so, yeah.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:10.120]   So I have the--
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.120]   That's interesting for the NSA.
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.120]   --the NSA flaw, which powered WannaCry.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:15.240]   Yeah, actually, it is called Bluekeep.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.240]   It's using the--
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.360]   Oh, it is Bluekeep, right, yeah.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.760]   It's similar to the Eternal Blue.
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:20.760]   Bluekeep sounds like a--
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.600]   Eternal Blue was the NSA exploit.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.600]   Yes.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.400]   Bluekeep is the weaponized version of it, which is--
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.400]   Bluekeep is this.
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:33.840]   --is this new one, this RDP flaw, which because so few XP machines will ever be patched,
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:36.400]   even though Microsoft weirdly enough is offering a patch for them.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.400]   No, no, they did it for--
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:38.400]   You have to go get XP.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:39.400]   Right.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.400]   You can get it.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.400]   But you have to go get it, and that's the problem.
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.040]   Unless you had your own cellular network where you could push it out.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:49.680]   Anybody who's still running Windows XP is probably not checking for updates.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.680]   No.
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:51.680]   So--
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:52.680]   They better not be connected to the internet.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.680]   I mean, you say that.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:58.040]   I went down to JPL a few years back for a landing.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.720]   And their projection system runs on XP.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:03.320]   When the projector went into dark mode, you got the little XP.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.320]   It's like--
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:06.320]   It's a cheap P.L.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.320]   For goodness sake.
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:08.320]   It's not online.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.320]   It's just online.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.320]   No, I know.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.320]   But there's a principle of--
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.320]   Well, it's budgetary issues.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.320]   It's budgetary issues.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.320]   It's never going to be updated.
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.320]   It's budgetary issues.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.320]   And it's difficult sometimes for--
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.320]   Well, and I'm not going to buy a whole new--
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.320]   I'm not going to buy a whole new--
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.320]   I take pros to make a business case.
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.320]   Extra machine just so that--
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.320]   I get the right--
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.320]   Right.
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.320]   --forachital.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.440]   So this is going to be-- Steve Gibson on Tuesday was saying it's going to be the end of the world.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.440]   I don't know.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:31.440]   Maybe that's what's going on.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.440]   I don't know.
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:33.760]   But watch out for Blue Keep.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:40.040]   And if you have a Windows XP machine or Windows 7 or Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:47.680]   2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008, please update it so that you're not part of the problem.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.680]   Because it's a worm, which means it will use the network to spread.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.680]   It was probably--
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.480]   But them fixing it is an exception.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:56.480]   I mean, these are--
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:58.760]   That's how serious Microsoft says this is.
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:41:59.760]   Oh, we better--
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.920]   But the next one, they might not be a security patch because these are--
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.320]   But I think they're desperate to avoid another one across the situation.
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.560]   I mean, in part, Marcus Hutchins is now looking at prison time.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.760]   But yeah, I mean, so he's not going to be around for that.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:18.760]   But looking through the actual security announcement we got from Microsoft, this was very unusual
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:19.760]   language.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.520]   It's like, this is a wormable hole.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.680]   This is not language they use.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:24.880]   I think I'm genuinely concerned about this.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.680]   So this blog post from Microsoft was very, very strange.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:34.280]   We did talk about it at length on Windows Weekly.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:39.280]   This is from Computex, which just ended in Taipei, Taiwan.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:44.880]   It starts off talking about all the new laptops, there's some very interesting PCs and laptops
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.000]   coming out, some really nice ones.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.720]   And then, in fact, Paul Therat and Mary Jeff Foley thought maybe this was a cut and paste
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.720]   error.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.440]   All of a sudden, there's a paragraph about a new operating system.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.880]   These machines can't run and probably never will run that Microsoft is dubbing a modern
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.800]   OS, sometimes with a capital M, sometimes not.
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.840]   So it's not even clear if that's the name of it.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:13.520]   But it's a manifesto completely separate from the rest of the blog post, a manifesto
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:18.760]   for what the next version of Windows should have, automatic, seamless updates.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:19.760]   Right?
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.760]   I think we'll all agree.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:21.760]   This is what we were sold for Windows 10.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:25.160]   Oh, they said this every year for secure by default.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:28.400]   Oh, yeah, because they're not going to say, well, is there a few holes in that?
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.400]   We can't find that.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.520]   Well, what they're talking about though here is sandboxing and Microsoft is of late really
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:35.640]   been doubling down on the idea of sandboxing.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:41.960]   They just really stay a browser plugin that allows you to run Internet Explorer and Edge.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:48.520]   Well, they're arguing, they're using here basically is if your enterprise has a list
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.480]   of sites that are whitelisted.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.760]   And then when if your users is like, let's go to another site, do, do, do, do, do, do,
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.280]   and they go into a site that is a known hazard, it automatically sandboxes that session so
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:02.880]   that nothing can escape that browser session, get on to a user's machine and from then
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:03.880]   swap on to the network.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.960]   They also use a sandboxing Windows defender now that the antivirus.
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.520]   So when they say secure by default, they say the state is separated from the operating
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.440]   system and compute is separated from applications.
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.120]   So I think they're just saying we want it the entire thing kind of like what is it,
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.520]   cubes OS, which is everything is every process is sandbox.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.800]   I think that's interesting.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:23.800]   Always connected.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:24.960]   This is what you were talking about.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.800]   The idea of arm chips that are.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.800]   It's so cute how they think they're never going to be dead spots and connectivity.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.680]   It's a very, it's a very Silicon Valley, well, West Coast kind of phenomenon.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:39.120]   It's West Coast by way of never having gone east of the Sierra's.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.680]   Yeah, or even just north of San Francisco.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.480]   There's plenty of dead spots up north.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.040]   Go to Bodega Bay sometimes.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:51.720]   Always connected with a modern OS Wi-Fi and LTE 5G will just work.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.720]   Yeah, right.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.800]   And you will just work is the worst phrase of ever.
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.800]   No technology.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:00.120]   That means you're going to be hammering at the keyboard shouting at some point in the
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.120]   next.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.120]   And you never have to worry about it.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.840]   It's going to will a network of satellites into place.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.160]   Like I just don't know.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.160]   You can be really good at it.
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.360]   Elon is willing into place.
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.360]   God bless him.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:11.360]   He's already 60.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.360]   Yep.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.760]   Now the astronomers are worried that if there's 12,000 you'll never see the sun again.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:15.760]   Well, exactly.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.280]   If we get a castor effect going on then we'll never get out of the craft and see what
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.280]   again.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.080]   Can you imagine like this is how this is how you saw climate change.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.080]   It's just heavy.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:25.480]   It's like it's not going to be a fuzzy, flinging satellites.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.720]   So the planet is 12,000 a low Earth orbit satellites.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.720]   Oh my God.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:34.000]   And there's only 2,000 space objects right now.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.040]   And now that admittedly is not yet the Kessler effect.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:37.680]   You'd still be able to get through them.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:38.680]   Oh yeah.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:44.360]   But at sunrise and sunset those guys would light up with fireflies from this starlight.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.320]   On the other hand, sky will be dark mode.
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.320]   Snapchat everywhere.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.320]   It might be worth it.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.320]   Dark mode.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.320]   Sky.
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:57.840]   They also say that a modern OS provides sustained performance.
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:01.360]   A cloud connected experiences, AI, multi sense.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.360]   This is interesting.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.040]   People can use pen, voice, touch and even gaze.
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:09.080]   Whatever input method a user wants to use works just as well as the keyboard in the
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.080]   mouse.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:12.080]   That's spelled G-A-Z-E for those on audio.
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:17.280]   I mean, I know it's Pride Month so I'm just making sure.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:23.520]   Oh, I never thought you could use gaze to operate an operating system.
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:28.160]   And then I had to, like that contagious joke earlier, I haven't really thought about
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.680]   anything about that.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.160]   And the modern OS has the ultimate informed factor agility.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.960]   The rest is who's supported in posture awareness.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.160]   It's unclear what they're talking about.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.200]   And then because they're unclear what they're talking about.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:44.560]   The real thing Paul said is this is probably Windows Lite, which they've been talking a
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:47.800]   lot about, which is just a light version of Windows.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.840]   I said this would be great if they started from scratch, created a whole new operating
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:54.920]   system with modern needs in mind, but that's not what they're talking about.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:47:00.080]   Unless we're talking thin client where they're leveraging the cloud to do the compute
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:04.720]   offsite so that it never degrades because it's most of the computer's handling offsite.
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:07.760]   Oh, and that would be cool as long as there's no dead spots.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:10.720]   Yeah, as long as there's no dead spots.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:11.720]   I would watch with this.
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:14.920]   I think this modern OS is going to be into an IoT crowd.
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:15.920]   They do mention IoT.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:20.760]   Because this actually seemed one of the biggest challenges in IoT can be inconsistent connectivity
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:26.840]   especially if you're talking about cases like in oil fields or some agricultural things.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:32.880]   And so if Microsoft is like rebuilding an OS that is comparatively lightweight and still
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:36.960]   allows connectivity so it transmits data when you need it and when it's actionable, this
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.920]   seems aim-bride at it.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:44.720]   Paul Therat took yesterday to release his review of the Huawei P30 phone.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:49.640]   Best smartphone camera ever he said shortly after that, Huawei announced we're not making
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640]   any more phones.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.160]   We are slowing down phone production because of the United States restrictions.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:48:00.000]   Just as they become the second largest smartphone manufacturer in the world and then this happens.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.160]   It's the weirdest story ever.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.040]   We'll never get to the bottom of it.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:09.360]   We've talked about it a lot on all of our shows but apparently the latest news is Huawei
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.200]   is ending smartphone production.
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:13.920]   It does make among the best smartphones.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.520]   As you said, the number two smartphone company in the world.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.520]   Paul loves it.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:22.840]   I hope you, from where that Paul is three months from now, there'll be no more entry and updates.
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:24.840]   Yeah, that's the rub.
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:26.640]   I don't know if we want to use it.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.760]   This isn't being kicked out of the IEEE.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.800]   Everybody is just turning their back.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.800]   They're being...
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.800]   What is it that's by others?
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.800]   But there's no evidence.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.680]   You know, the same thing they did with Kaspersky, no evidence, same thing we will.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.680]   It's security.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.080]   The reason why we went to Iraq in the first place.
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.080]   It's security theater.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:49.000]   It's the question of doing something instead of addressing the real...
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.920]   It's watched the hand, watched the hand, watched the hand, watched the hand, watched the hand.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.640]   But it's almost like one person.
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:53.840]   I'm not going to mention the names.
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.400]   Almost like one person is like...
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:56.880]   ...deciding to kill this company.
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:57.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:58.880]   It just seems that way for some reason.
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:00.880]   So, who benefits by the company being killed?
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:01.880]   Did it question you have to consider?
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.680]   I was in a joke store in Vegas yesterday.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.840]   I don't know if this sounds like a bad idea.
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:10.280]   It was called Stupidiotic, which is a good name.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:15.280]   And it had red MAGA hats, but the slogan on it was, "Make red hats great again."
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.760]   I like that.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.160]   I might buy that hat.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.400]   I think that's a good hat.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.400]   And Ian, you have that sticker?
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:22.400]   Which one?
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.400]   Oh.
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:24.400]   Yeah, "Make root great again."
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.160]   I didn't even see that!
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:29.160]   No, I know.
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:30.160]   I picked that up at Shmoop on a couple of years ago.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.160]   "Make root great again."
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.160]   Oh my gosh.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.680]   I could wear that shirt.
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:36.680]   U.S. is now...
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:38.520]   We'll just continue in this vein.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:41.960]   The U.S. is now seeking social media details from all visa applicants.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:44.760]   I knew it as an immigrant.
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:50.440]   When the Obama administration first floated this, I was just like, "Yeah, this isn't good.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.080]   This is going to snowball quite..."
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:56.520]   And now, and then went from voluntarily give your social media profiles, only your public
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:57.920]   facing social media profiles.
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:58.920]   Right.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:49:59.920]   And now, give it all now.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:04.000]   And it's not as though terrorists are going to be going, "Oh, off to America, about to blow
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000]   over."
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]   Oh, no, no, I'm just going to walk through the tube.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000]   Hashtag boom.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000]   Yolo.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:19.600]   So the new visa application lists a number of social media platforms and then says, "You
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.600]   must give us any account name you may have used over the previous five years."
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.600]   Oh my gosh.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:30.720]   Can you imagine if a young person who's had a Finstagram or anything like that?
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.720]   It's just...
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:34.920]   Also, five years have previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:40.720]   and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have ever been terrorists.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.440]   Honest to God, they asked that question.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:46.040]   Okay, story time.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.040]   Back when you...
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:51.120]   As a Brit, you could come to the US and they would just give you a little green form.
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:54.840]   You filled in on the flight and that gave you 90 days access.
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:56.640]   And there was some yes or no questions yet to answer.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.560]   It was like, "Have you visited a farm recently with it had infectious things?
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.320]   Have you carrying any fruits and veg?"
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.880]   And then the last question was, "Have you participated in any acts of genocide since 1945?"
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.880]   And he was like, "What are they expecting?"
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.320]   So we go, "Take yes, the last one.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.160]   I just cleansed my soul."
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:17.480]   I don't know why they put these questions in, whether it's a liability question or whether
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.640]   it's just something else they can throw at you.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:20.640]   Security.
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:21.640]   But with social media, that's just...
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:27.800]   It's a great way to shut down immigrants who want to critique the US on social media,
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:28.800]   isn't it?
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.800]   Yeah, come here if you don't want it.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.800]   Right.
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.800]   And it's already here.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:36.280]   It's a great way to have you avoid making it in the observations that would appear not
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.280]   normal to anybody who's already habituated to what's going on in this country.
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.840]   It's like the census form for...
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:43.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:46.440]   That's how they have to check whether or not you're a citizen or not.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:47.440]   Do they go through?
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.440]   Is that in?
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.440]   It's still not...
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.440]   So fun story this week.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.440]   Is this the hard drive?
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:52.440]   Yes.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.440]   This is just a great story.
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.200]   I was going to go for it.
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:00.640]   And bear in mind, it's been a long decade, week, whatever.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:07.080]   As it turns out, the Republican strategist who came up with the citizens...
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:08.560]   Thomas B. Huffler.
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:09.560]   Yes.
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:10.560]   So he dies.
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:11.560]   In August.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:17.280]   His estranged daughter, who happens to be a progressive, finds these disk drives with
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:23.520]   all of the details as to how to get this highly politicized question onto the census.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.520]   And so the plausible...
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:28.080]   Well, no, it's totally not a political question.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.080]   The defense has now been...
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:31.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:35.400]   He explicitly says, you know, this is designed to bolster white and Republican support.
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:36.400]   Yes.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:37.400]   Yes.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:38.400]   Could it...
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.400]   Can he freely?
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:40.400]   Yes.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:41.400]   What?
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:42.400]   Who'd have thought it?
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:43.400]   Oh, wow.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.400]   That's surprising that came out of nowhere.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.400]   Absolutely massive.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:50.520]   Mr. Huffler's exhaustive analysis of Texas state legislative districts concluded such
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:55.360]   maps would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites and would dilute
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:58.680]   the political power of the state's Hispanic population.
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:52:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.840]   And this is a man whose career was based on using computer modeling to build the most
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.920]   elaborately gerrymandered sort of districts.
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:09.560]   But he didn't know enough to sanitize his hard drives.
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:10.560]   No, I know.
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:11.560]   This is...
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:14.360]   Oh, I guess this is when your grip from the tech illiteracy is...
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:23.000]   The moral of this is, please, use encryption, hold this encryption, and make sure that that
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.560]   way you don't have to wipe your drive.
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:25.560]   I don't know.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.800]   I'd like to think the moral of this is if you're a politics dumb bit dick.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:34.280]   Without questions on citizenship being included on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire,
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:40.960]   Mr. Huffler wrote, "The use of citizen voting age population is functionally unworkable.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:47.120]   They want to detailed citizenship data to draw the maps."
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:52.400]   So anyway, it's kind of the smoking drive, not a smoking gun, but the smoking drive.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.400]   Right.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:57.120]   Anyway, that's neither here nor there.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.560]   I mean, it's not just in the US.
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:53:59.560]   Let's talk to Mr....
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:00.560]   Oh, no.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.560]   What have we done now?
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:02.560]   Mr. B. Thompson.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:03.560]   If it goes to protocol...
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.560]   If it goes to protocol...
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.560]   Do you remember the GHCQs?
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:08.560]   Oh, it's the GHCQs protocol.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.560]   Oh, Cs...
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:10.560]   Ah, Conswak, Conswak.
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:11.560]   Okay.
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.560]   Right.
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:13.560]   Okay.
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.720]   It sounds like the next born novel.
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:16.720]   Yeah, it does.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:19.120]   Wait, was there a Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol?
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:20.120]   There was a ghost protocol.
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.120]   It was...
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:27.560]   This is a utterly bonkers piece of mental justification.
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:32.040]   Basically, what they're saying is the intelligence agencies in the UK appear to have come round
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:37.160]   to the thought that maybe permanently backdooring encryption so that anyone who finds that
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:41.120]   back door can read all your communications might be a bad idea on the security front.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:42.760]   So they come up with this new thing.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:47.160]   Make the telecommunications companies and the apps companies allow us to be added as
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:50.160]   a ghost partner in any group chats.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:55.440]   So if you're chatting with someone, even on an encrypted line, then the telco will have
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:00.320]   a legal duty and they've already implemented this in Australia to allow law enforcement
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:02.680]   to silently come on, listen to what's being said.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:08.080]   Wasn't this the flaw in Apple's FaceTime protocol that all you had to do was add a ghost
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:09.080]   participant and you'd be able...
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:11.080]   Well, I mean, they've...
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:12.320]   They wonder if they were getting ready for this.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:17.360]   I mean, GHCQ, which is our version of the NSA, a couple of GHCQ engineers wrote a sort
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.960]   of think piece about three months ago going, "Look.
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:21.200]   This is how we get around it.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:24.160]   Law enforcement needs to be able to listen in on this stuff.
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:30.160]   But if we work with the app developers and the app runners, then people will show self-restraint
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.000]   and this will be something which will only be used very carefully.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.800]   And based on past experience, all the restraint and a Labrador and unguarded roast chicken,
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:41.800]   I mean, they're going to be right in there grabbing everything they possibly can."
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:46.160]   Those developers, 47 strong, including Apple, Google, and the usual suspects have written
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.160]   a letter.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:52.160]   "It's a 20-second, two GHCQ, to whom it may concern."
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:54.400]   We don't like this idea.
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:56.720]   They're saying, "We don't agree with it.
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:00.160]   This is the law fair blog talking about it.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.960]   It's actually been the best place to read that."
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:02.960]   All fair is excellent on this stuff.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:09.000]   That's where the ghost protocol piece was originally publicized.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.040]   Apple, Google, who else?
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:15.360]   Microsoft, WhatsApp, all saying this is a...
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.360]   Obviously.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:17.360]   That's a terrible idea.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:21.000]   Well, they don't want to get involved with this, because it's a massive loss.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.880]   There's no benefit in it for them and potentially massive losses.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:28.520]   The authors of the proposal called it a "virtual crocodile clips."
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:33.080]   I like the comments where it says, "Government shouldn't spy on people."
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.080]   That's the businesses over there.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.080]   That's true.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.960]   That's the man who's capital is a joy.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.560]   We don't need the competition.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:48.760]   The GCHQ's ghost proposal wrote the company's completely undermines the trust relationship
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:51.200]   we have with our customers and the other...
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.840]   No, the Facebook is listed.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:54.160]   Yeah, we trust us.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:55.160]   They trust us.
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:56.160]   They trust us.
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.520]   I mean, if you try this with something like Signal, then they'll tell the intelligence
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.040]   how you just get stuffed, which is why...
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:02.200]   What's happening in Australia?
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:03.200]   Because that is the law.
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:04.200]   That is the law.
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:06.360]   They've passed the law.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.360]   This is...
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.360]   It was a marvelous quote from some Australian minister who then he luckes out of a job
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:15.840]   now, but he was like, "The laws of mathematics may be what they be, but the laws of Australia
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:16.840]   are coming."
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:18.840]   The Prime Minister said, "Yeah."
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:20.840]   Just like, "Ah."
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:22.280]   But yeah, they passed this law.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:27.880]   And now, officially, if law enforcement, if you're using any kind of communication service
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:32.480]   in Australia at the moment, then law enforcement can come to you and say, "We need access
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.480]   to this content.
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:34.480]   Make it happen."
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:37.480]   And it hasn't been tested in law yet, but it's going to be...
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:40.400]   And this is the same country that's like, "Please, please, no.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.920]   I'll have a right not to have unwanted email in the inbox."
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.920]   Well, it's...
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:45.920]   Truly.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:46.920]   Expecting consistency.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.440]   A little bit of advice for our Australian listeners.
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:55.880]   Do not use the public Wi-Fi at McDonald's or Westfield because, other than new encryption
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:56.880]   legislation, that please can...
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.120]   I think you have to read incredibly unhealthy food.
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:05.320]   Please can compel those Wi-Fi providers to turn over information about people using
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:07.520]   their open Wi-Fi.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:12.600]   I mean, this is what's coming down the line.
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.320]   And I think particularly worrying in America is that we've now got...
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.680]   I mean, this will be fought all the way by people like the CDT and the EFF and that sort
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:20.680]   of thing.
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:25.280]   But with the makeup of the Supreme Court as it stands at the moment, and with two of the
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:33.600]   Supremes who are actually strongest on privacy and security in their 80s, the next 10, 20,
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:38.480]   30 years is going to be really, really difficult unless there's some serious publicities.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.240]   There's education and public demand going through.
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:46.240]   And we're having discussions going back to Huawei about they could be spying, they could
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.880]   be listening in.
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:53.080]   And we're losing moral ground here by not speaking out wherever it happens or wherever
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.840]   it could happen around the world.
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:02.760]   And once again, it's aiming at companies and not what is the thing that is causing the
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:07.840]   biggest threat and just surveillance against the population, no matter if it's in Asia
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:11.720]   or if it's in Australia, is still something that can go horribly awry.
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:15.200]   Well, we've habituated people to surveillance as a consumer feature though.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:20.200]   I mean, look at what smart homes are or look at the expectations that we've trained people
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:25.080]   to with web browsers where we've now got people clicking except on cookies because they think,
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:29.880]   "Oh, it's perfectly reasonable for any company to monitor what I do online and in return,
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:32.240]   I don't have to do with a bunch of pop-ups on a web screen."
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:37.480]   I mean, one of the shrewdest things that people have done over the last 20 years is normalize
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:43.320]   folks to the idea that surveillance is a fun perk of modern life and makes things more
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:46.000]   convenient for you and in a way, mobile devices.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:50.760]   And again, things like my watch only make it much more so because we've voluntarily
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:55.640]   bought the instruments that allow everybody to keep tabs on us and erode our privacy.
[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:01.960]   I mean, it's I think also, it's coming back to what you were saying about Huawei.
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:06.680]   It's if the US is going to start lobbing round accusations of back-dored kit and that sort
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:10.760]   of thing, it's a very thin glass house to be lobbing bricks like that around in because
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:16.640]   the US has been doing this since the 1950s with crypto AG stuff and with, you know, in
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:20.660]   terms of the dual point of the dual-curve elliptical stuff, you know, this is common
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:23.800]   knowledge and seems to say, "Well, the Chinese are going to do it."
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:27.440]   Honestly, with the political situation in this country at the moment, I think there
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:31.240]   are going to be a lot of countries overseas looking, you know, who's looking more sane
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:34.360]   and stable at the moment, China or the US?
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:36.440]   Who would we rather have back doors from?
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:37.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:38.520]   So we'd, I don't know, we'll see.
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:41.520]   Same with Wireshark, not Wireshark, but the Stingrays.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:42.520]   Yeah.
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:46.800]   And just there's a lot of technology here where people, when they find out about it,
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:48.960]   they're trying to change the laws.
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:52.320]   And so if it's legal here, we should speak out everywhere.
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:53.320]   Yeah.
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.320]   San Francisco has actually been very good on that.
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:57.400]   They just passed this, I think it was a couple of weeks ago.
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:01.200]   If you're going to use a Stingray or any kind of inception device within San Francisco
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:07.080]   City limits, you have the police actually have to detail to the, to the alleged elected
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:09.920]   officials what they're using and what they're using it for.
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:12.880]   Because at the moment, it's just, it's wild west out there.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:18.200]   You know, people are just using the police are using Stingrays are, are where they,
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:19.520]   it personated cell phones.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:20.520]   Yeah.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:21.520]   Yeah.
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:25.200]   And they can intercept your traffic, your phone, gladly join them and become a man.
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:29.240]   I was actually really surprised to see that as a plot point on the season finale for Brooklyn
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:30.240]   9/9.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:31.160]   Oh, really?
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:34.960]   Yeah, no, it was a two part, it was a two, two harder.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.520]   And if you had told me that one third of the lonely island was going to be.
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:39.520]   It's pretty funny.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:41.760]   It was going to be on a TV show.
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:47.360]   That protested the use of, of these devices in policing in New York City.
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:52.800]   Like that was literally the two part was taking down top brass in the fictional New
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:54.440]   York City police.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.440]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:58.520]   For San Francisco also just passed a bill against face recognition.
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:03.720]   In fact, that was, if you saw the problem, Brian Hoven was on triangulation on Friday.
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:08.080]   Was the advocate who got that law passed as a great, a fascinating, a great, a great
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:09.080]   manipulation.
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:10.080]   No, it's a great manipulation.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:14.080]   But what's unnerving though is that we're getting such a patchwork now where some people
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.640]   have more rights in some parts of this country digitally speaking than they do in other parts
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:18.640]   of this country.
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:22.800]   And how are we going to reconcile that over the long term?
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.480]   All I know is saying politicians look like Brooklyn.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:28.480]   Google Plus is still up.
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:30.480]   That has to be what we call this episode.
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:34.120]   Google is saying Gmail service has been restored for some users.
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.240]   We expect a resolution for all users in the near future.
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:41.320]   Please note, this timeframe is an estimate in May.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:46.760]   But I do see lots of red dots on services except, of course, for Google Plus, which
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:47.920]   we're so happy.
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:51.920]   Apparently, Google Plus uses no Google infrastructure at all.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:52.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:54.480]   We're running that on Azure.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.320]   Yeah.
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.400]   Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:59.200]   Then we're going to get to the good news.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.200]   Happy.
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:01.200]   I promise.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:02.200]   Happy news coming up next.
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:05.240]   LastPass is happy news for anybody.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.840]   LastPass generates long, strong passwords and remembers them for you.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.840]   So you don't have to.
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:12.560]   All you have to do is remember your master password.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:17.320]   And the minute I get home tonight, I'm going to use LastPass to change all those old passwords.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:22.400]   They have a great security audit, which will automate it so I can go in and find all the
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.280]   places where I reused passwords and fix it.
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:29.800]   That's the kind of thing a great password manager should do.
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:32.240]   I am a huge LastPass fan.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:34.480]   I know you will be too.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:37.080]   And LastPass has a plan for everybody.
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.800]   LastPass premium for individuals, LastPass families.
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:40.960]   That's what we use at home.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:45.040]   One of my features I love about LastPass families, besides the fact that I can easily
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:46.920]   share family passwords with my wife.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:48.360]   So we have a folder, the family.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:54.080]   Anytime I put a password into that family folder, Lisa gets access to it.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.480]   But she's also my emergency access contact.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:00.600]   If anything should happen to me, she can have access to my password vault, which means
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:04.640]   she's not left out in the cold trying to figure out how to get into my bank account,
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.560]   my Facebook and all of that.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:09.240]   I think that's a really nice feature.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:11.280]   LastPass is great for enterprises too.
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:15.240]   If you have a team of 50 or fewer people that's LastPass teams, we use LastPass Enterprise
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:16.720]   here at Twit.
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:17.720]   And that is awesome.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.840]   100 plus customizable policies to give you more flexibility and control when it comes
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.080]   to managing access for your organization.
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.720]   You pick the policies that are right for your business.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:31.240]   For instance, we have master password requirements here.
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:34.680]   We enforce a minimum length, a number of digits, things like that.
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:41.080]   We also have admin to customize reporting so we can track changes over time to turn
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:46.280]   trends to continue to improve password security with seamless background sync, offline access
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:47.880]   and app for almost every device.
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.320]   Actually, that's why I use LastPass.
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:50.960]   I have extensions for all the browsers.
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:51.960]   It works on iOS.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:52.960]   It works for Android.
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:55.160]   It auto fills on iOS and Android.
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:56.160]   That's nice too.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:58.920]   In fact, it's the first app I install when I get a new phone because then all the other
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:02.920]   apps I'm going to install just the password just auto filled in by LastPass.
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:03.920]   I just love it.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.160]   And it's secure.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:09.960]   Your password vault is trust no one encrypted everywhere except on device.
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:11.600]   LastPass doesn't have access to it.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.880]   Only you do.
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:15.040]   LastPass.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:18.400]   And over 13 and a half million people who signed up for LastPass and are loving and trusting
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:19.400]   it.
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:20.760]   It's my choice.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:22.640]   It's what you should use what we use here at Twit.
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:26.880]   If you want to know more, go to lasspass.com/twit to find out how they can help you.
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:27.880]   LastPass.com/twit.
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:30.400]   They're nice guys too.
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:31.640]   Nice guys and gals.
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:33.520]   I really like the LastPass team.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:36.800]   LastPass.com/twit.
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:38.440]   Thank you, LastPass, for supporting Twit.
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:43.480]   Thank you, TwitListener, for supporting us by using lasspass.com/twit.
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.480]   All right.
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:46.800]   You want some good news, happy news?
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.800]   I'll find some.
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:48.880]   Well, this was less happy news.
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:53.120]   Did you see Wikipedia's story about North Face defacing now?
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:56.640]   This was maximum scumminess.
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:59.040]   It was basically the...
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:04.120]   An ad agency noticed that if you look at it, if you Google search for a landscape, then
[02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:07.000]   generally the first couple of images come from Wikipedia.
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.680]   So they thought, "Aha, I've got an idea.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:14.440]   Why don't we go to our client in this case, overpriced tap manufacturer, North Face?"
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:17.320]   And say, "Right, we'll do some lovely pictures of these landscapes.
[02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:22.120]   Have someone with your logo in the background, stick it up onto Wikipedia."
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:25.560]   And then you'll get lots of brand recognition in Google searches.
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:28.920]   And instead of somebody saying, "Well, hang on, that means spamming a public interest group
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.720]   with advertising images."
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:34.560]   They went, "Great, in fact, let's make a video about how we did it."
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:36.560]   They put a promotional video on YouTube.
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:38.760]   Here's the title.
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:42.760]   How can a brand be the first on Google without paying anything for it?
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:44.760]   "Uphuse Wikipedia!
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:46.320]   It's a... the brainer!"
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:49.000]   Shit, hubris of it was just painful.
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.880]   And so, yeah, I mean, I think it was ad week, picked it up, we picked it up, and the video
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:56.920]   was taken down within minutes of the...
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:00.680]   They falsely claimed that Wikipedia helped them, they did not.
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:03.440]   And Wikipedia came back with an epic burn.
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:04.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:05.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:08.680]   Shame on you, North Face.
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:11.640]   Shame on Leo Burnett, the ad agency who came up with this.
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:12.640]   This goes...
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:16.840]   This is the same as when Burger King modified their Wikipedia entry for the Whopper.
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:23.360]   And then, in an ad, gave the Google Assistant a command to talk about the Whopper, because
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:27.840]   as they knew Google Assistant took Wikipedia's copy, they put an ad on Wikipedia.
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:28.840]   I don't know how these guys...
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:37.800]   Well, this is a great example of the perils of hijacking third-party systems and violating
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:38.800]   trust.
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:40.960]   There need to be consequences beyond bad PR.
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:43.560]   Well, the bad PR consequences is pretty serious.
[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:46.160]   Yeah, but the thing is, is you can no longer trust...
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:47.160]   If you know that...
[02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.360]   Hey, Alexa, tell me about Burger King.
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.720]   Alexa effectively reads you an ad, thanks to the thing Burger King did.
[02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:53.720]   But that happens on...
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:54.720]   That's a vital...
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:56.280]   Go to the Donald Trump entry on Wikipedia to watch.
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:57.280]   But that's a...
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.960]   My point is, is that's a violation of trust across several systems.
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:00.960]   I agree.
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:01.960]   It's misinformations.
[02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:02.960]   It's misinformation.
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:03.960]   But Wikipedia has very good systems.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:05.680]   There's editors going in, they fixed it, they fixed it here.
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:07.040]   They immediately told the world.
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:09.600]   And I think North Face got a big egg on their face full.
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:10.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.760]   But it's going to be gone.
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:15.920]   Number one, that story is going to be off people's radar in a matter of days, if not
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:16.920]   already.
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:21.600]   And number two, it's not like there's going to be any lasting awareness on the part of
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:26.640]   people who do use voice activated search to answer questions or who do use Wikipedia
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:32.160]   to realize how vulnerable either one of these systems are to misinformation for the purposes
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:33.400]   of brand recognition.
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:35.200]   So they apologize to the register.
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.320]   Yeah, they apologize to a little people.
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:38.320]   They stopped it.
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:41.380]   and I'm sorry, and they made a big donation to Wikipedia.
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.260]   Good.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:44.120]   No, they didn't, no, they didn't.
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:44.960]   Do that.
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:48.240]   Wikipedia though did say actually though some of the pictures are very pretty,
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:50.500]   so once you scrubbed all your logos out of everything,
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.920]   then we'll carry on using them thanks.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:56.340]   If I'm the rival Pat Election basically in my next move is to put a billboard
[02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:59.880]   saying we don't mess with your free internet, and just, and just like keep
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:01.420]   reminding people what North Face did.
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:02.220]   Yeah.
[02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:07.280]   I feel like this is an opportunity that North Face has just handed to REI and Pat
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:09.280]   Goni and all of the other people.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:10.280]   They better not.
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.080]   I think they may have learned the lesson that this does not end.
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:15.560]   No, what I'm saying is how to go in and can be like, unlike some people,
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.040]   we don't need to end up with an email.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.040]   You should shave them.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:22.000]   Like seriously, just keep it in people's minds and associate it with.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.160]   But I mean, you can never expect scummy ideas from advertising agencies,
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:29.200]   but to think that nobody at North Face actually said, you know what,
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:33.280]   this might backfire and then instead just went and posted about it.
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:36.040]   But the tech story here is if you have an intelligent,
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.520]   if you have an assistant like Siri or Alexa or Google Assistant that's using
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.440]   something like Wikipedia when you make a voice inquiry, like Wikipedia,
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:48.560]   who's Marie Curie and it comes back with, well, Marie Curie happened to discover
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:51.720]   a couple of elements and more importantly, she's known for not running a led by
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.720]   Dapron like this.
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:54.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:10:01.760]   I mean, this is a vulnerability in a system of education and information.
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:06.160]   The sad part is they expect some of these companies expect backlash and they use
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:07.160]   that as amplification.
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:12.200]   Like, if you look at IHOP or IHOP, they would talk about changing that.
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:13.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:15.200]   And they're doing it again.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:16.200]   They're saying they're renaming their self to IHOP.
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:17.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:18.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:19.200]   And it's back to IHOP.
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:20.200]   Yes.
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:21.200]   And there's going to be another announcement.
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:22.200]   It's just the bad prices part of this cycle.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:23.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:24.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:25.200]   And you've seen Nihilist Arby's Twitter.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.200]   It's like, my favorite.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:27.200]   Oh, yes.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:29.680]   But also, I mean, the same thing happened with Heinz because in the UK, we have this stuff
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.160]   called salad cream, which is kind of like mayonnaise, but not.
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:34.160]   Yeah.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.360]   It's kind of like faux mayonnaise-ish.
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:40.480]   And there was a couple of years ago, they were just like, we're going to ban it.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:41.480]   Heinz said, that's it.
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:42.960]   No one's buying salad cream anymore.
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:43.960]   Bloody millennials.
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:45.920]   We're going to shut it down.
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:49.480]   And then there was huge PR campaign about it brings back salad cream.
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:50.480]   And it was all marketing.
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:51.480]   Yeah.
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:53.120]   They never intended to take out salad cream.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.360]   So it was just like, why not?
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:58.280]   I don't know what salad cream is, but I think they should cancel it immediately.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:01.080]   I vote to kill salad cream.
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:02.080]   OK.
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:03.080]   Yeah.
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.080]   Yeah.
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:09.760]   If you had any messages on Blackberry Messenger, I hope you saved them because it's gone as
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:12.280]   of yesterday or Friday, I guess.
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:13.280]   BBM.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:14.280]   Yeah.
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:15.280]   We love to be here.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:16.280]   Right?
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.280]   We all love BBM back in the day.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:18.280]   Back in the day when it was good.
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:19.280]   Yeah.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.280]   Yeah.
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:23.040]   I mean, it's, and then we find out that they were willingly back-doring it for the Indian
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:24.040]   government.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:25.040]   Yeah.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.280]   But I mean, what is left now for Blackberry?
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:28.880]   Is it basically sit on some patterns?
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:29.880]   They own QNX.
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:30.880]   Oh, well.
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:32.880]   They own a real-time operating system.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:35.880]   They're sitting there making hay while the sun shines.
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:40.440]   I've heard they were talking about doing their own sort of specific secure communications,
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:41.440]   but I think that ships sail.
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:42.440]   No, I think they--
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:43.440]   No, Blackberry Enterprise.
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:44.440]   Yeah.
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:45.440]   That's about it.
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:46.440]   Yeah.
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:47.920]   I think QNX is the future.
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:52.120]   They've kind of pivoted into, like we were talking earlier about bringing your own device
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:53.760]   management for Enterprise.
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:54.760]   Interesting.
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:59.800]   So they sell an Enterprise server where they can control all these other iOS and Android
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.760]   devices from other manufacturers where they're trying to make money.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:03.760]   Yeah.
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:06.800]   I could get a little salad cream in my life from a Pound 55.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.800]   Oh, they have a medical grocery store.
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:09.800]   They have salad cream?
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:10.800]   They have a big ethnic food.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:11.800]   I know.
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:12.800]   I know.
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:13.800]   I think it's not an ethnic food.
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:15.800]   I think it's the opposite of ethnic food.
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:22.280]   No, I'm always really amused as how it's one aisle where you've got your fish sauce and
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:23.280]   you've got your pizole.
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:24.280]   It's a taste line.
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:25.280]   You've got salad cream.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:30.680]   It's kind of like a slightly sweet, vinegary mayonnaise with that's more gloopy.
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:33.120]   So it's kind of like an expert.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.680]   You know how to sell, boy.
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.680]   Yeah.
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:36.680]   Are these songs beautiful?
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:37.680]   Yeah, maybe.
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:40.880]   Yeah, it's similar to Santa's sauce but not quite as a lot of stringent.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:41.880]   But they're not stringed.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:43.680]   They're not like a lot of the lumps.
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:49.480]   But yeah, it's sort of-- I will admit that if you're on video, you should watch his face
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:50.480]   as he's describing.
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:59.240]   It's a shameful thing to admit, but I do post Christmas dinner having a turkey, lettuce,
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:03.160]   and salad-- we do that with Russian dressing here in America.
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:06.600]   Yeah, it's just-- it's the one time of the year I'll eat it.
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:07.840]   But you know, it's-- you're right.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:08.840]   It's a little fishy.
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:11.560]   You say that with shame, yeah.
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:13.200]   Congratulations to T-Series.
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:14.200]   The battle is over.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:16.000]   T-Series versus PewDiePie.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.520]   Ah, T-Series, the first YouTube channel to hit 100 million subscribers.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.840]   It's a-- I think it's an Indian Bollywood channel.
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:27.080]   Maybe it's PewDiePie's attacking Google.
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:29.080]   No, I just like that.
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:30.080]   It's probably in a Russian.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.680]   So it's PewDiePie and not PewDiePie.
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:34.680]   PewDiePie.
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:35.680]   I don't know.
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:36.680]   I pronounce it useless.
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:37.680]   You call it PewDiePie?
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:42.120]   It was supposed to-- it was originally a game channel where he shared us like, PewDie!
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:44.120]   You know, that's what I like.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.120]   That's where it goes.
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:47.120]   No!
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:48.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:49.120]   I don't know.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:51.960]   But I don't think it's PewDiePie.
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:52.960]   No, probably not.
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:53.960]   It did.
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:54.960]   I've never seen it.
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:55.960]   I've never watched it.
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:56.960]   PewDiePie.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.960]   Just read about his terrible, terrible stations.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:00.360]   PewDiePie like CutiePie.
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:01.360]   Wow.
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.360]   No, because it's--
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:03.960]   It is Pew Pew Pew, I'm sure.
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:05.560]   But I don't know about the die part.
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:09.840]   No, the only thing I know about that site is that a lot of people who do terrible things
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.200]   seem to really like him.
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:12.200]   So--
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:13.200]   Yeah.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:16.240]   PewDiePie called for the battle to end last month.
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.280]   He said it's been a hateful race and that's basically him giving up.
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:21.920]   And there we go.
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:22.920]   Here it is.
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:25.440]   You want to watch T-Series hitting $1 billion?
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:27.440]   Or whatever it is, $100 million subscribers.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:29.240]   Keep this short and simple.
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:33.520]   Congratulations, T-Series, the first YouTube channel to reach $100 million subscribers.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:35.040]   This guy looks like he eats salad cream.
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:36.040]   I don't know who else.
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:37.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:39.040]   It's like a cart of his ku-kubic of that.
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:40.800]   I don't mean YouTube is that much.
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:42.280]   This is really typical.
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:47.000]   Everybody else, completely independent third party, has made a YouTube video and has millions
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000]   of hits.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000]   You've just described the entire YouTube ecosystem.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.000]   Yeah, right there.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000]   Yeah.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000]   All right.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000]   Last story, but it's the happiest story of all.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000]   Can I add some context though?
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.040]   T-Series is the equivalent of Disney in India.
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.600]   So that's why it's so massive.
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:04.440]   It's because it's a major conglomerate of entertainment there.
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:05.440]   Do you love me?
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:06.440]   Yes.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:10.840]   Coming this summer, unfortunately, I'm handing in my Tesla in a month.
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:12.560]   I'm hoping I will get it.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:17.160]   Cuphead will be launching on Teslas this summer.
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:18.160]   Okay.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:21.560]   I already have great Atari games on my Tesla.
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:24.480]   I don't think you should play Cuphead while you're driving.
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:25.960]   Wow.
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:30.680]   It will be just the first area of Cuphead, the world's most difficult game.
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:33.200]   I am actually a Cuphead fanatic.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:38.680]   I have no idea why Tesla is putting this on their car except maybe to show off the power
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:40.080]   of the computing platform.
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:42.280]   I was going to say this is the thing called distracted driving.
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:43.280]   Yeah.
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:45.120]   They don't let you play while you're driving.
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:46.120]   Oh, right.
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:47.120]   Okay.
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:50.080]   You buy an $80,000 car just to sit there.
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:52.720]   You play while you're at the charging station.
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:54.960]   Ah, that makes sense, actually.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:55.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:56.960]   There's the use, right.
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:58.960]   Oh, in that case, it's key, essential feature.
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:07.280]   Model 3 Model S and Model X vehicles will get Cuphead on their 17-inch screen.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:13.080]   Why not do something good like the original Elite or, you know, it's even Donkey Kong.
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:14.080]   That's a good game.
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:15.080]   I like Cuphead.
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:16.080]   I'm a Cuphead fan.
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:17.080]   Okay.
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:18.080]   Very hard.
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:19.080]   Very, very hard.
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:20.880]   I'm surprised they don't have SETI for the Tesla.
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:24.080]   Wouldn't that be cool to devote some of those CPU cycles to finding extra dressed.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:25.080]   Yeah.
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:26.080]   You know what they'd find?
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:28.880]   They'd find the guy riding the Tesla Roadster up there.
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:29.880]   Yeah.
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:36.400]   I was watching a documentary from a YouTube guy that I follow and he drove the Model X
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:39.000]   from, I think it was LA to someplace inland.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.520]   He's charging this thing up in RV parks.
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:43.280]   I had no idea you could do that.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.880]   This is a state of eight hours.
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:45.880]   Yeah.
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:47.720]   You could plug it in the wall if you want.
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:48.720]   Yeah.
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:49.720]   But it sort of mapped out.
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:50.720]   Okay.
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:53.280]   They've got a 50-volt one here, a 25-volt one there.
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:54.280]   Yeah.
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:56.680]   So, you know, it's fascinating how this is going.
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:02.240]   So let's just wrap up the show with a quick check to see how it's going for Google.
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:04.960]   It looks like Gmail's coming back.
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:06.600]   YouTube's coming back.
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:10.760]   So it was really during this show only that we actually paid Google significant amounts
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:15.720]   of money to bring down the internet so that everybody would tune in Twit.
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:19.040]   My evil plan has succeeded.
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:23.160]   And yes, Google Plus is still up and running.
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:26.720]   Thank you so much, Wesley Faulkner.
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.000]   Good luck in finding.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.800]   There's is a LinkedIn finding new fans at linkedin.com/wesley83.
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:38.920]   That's his Twitter handle too, Wesley83.
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:40.600]   Wesley Faulkner, we love having you on.
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:41.760]   It's great to have you in studio.
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:47.040]   And I'll be at Del Rel Con, Thursday and Friday this week.
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:50.160]   So if you're at Del Rel Con, come say hi.
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:51.160]   Okay.
[02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:52.160]   Dev Rel.
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:53.160]   Is developer relations?
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.160]   Yeah, developer relations.
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:55.880]   And that's your special skill.
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:58.080]   developer relations.
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:17:59.080]   Dev Rel Con.
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.080]   Oh, cool.
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:01.080]   All right.
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:02.080]   Come see him.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.080]   Say hi.
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:04.080]   Thank you, Ms. Schmeiser.
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:07.080]   Lisa Schmeiser is editor at ITProToday@ITProToday.com.
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:08.080]   Yes.
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:09.080]   That's great.
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:13.680]   @LSCHMEISER on the Twitter.
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:15.280]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:17.120]   No, not right now.
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:18.960]   None of them are a site or a site.
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:19.960]   Just your site.
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:21.560]   Just a good site.
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:26.120]   And of course, from the register.co.uk, everybody's favorite Ian Thompson.
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:29.040]   How long do you think of a few people who I'm not?
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:31.320]   It's the time you're doing your job.
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:32.320]   Exactly.
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:34.600]   Make enemies while the sun shines.
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:37.600]   Ian, anything you want to plug?
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:42.000]   Actually, I'm going away for a week.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.200]   In a week's time, I'm going back to the old country for a couple of weeks.
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:46.480]   Will you have a chance to vote in the Brexit redo?
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:47.560]   I'm not allowed to vote.
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:49.480]   I'm not allowed to vote in the UK anymore.
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:51.480]   I've been here now.
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:54.760]   I left the country so long ago, I'm no longer allowed to vote in installations.
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:56.440]   And I can't vote here because I'm an immigrant.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:59.440]   And despite what some people tell you, I'm going to really can't vote in this show.
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:01.120]   Just tell me what you want to vote for.
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:02.600]   I'll do it for you.
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:05.200]   I want a magic unicorn, which is nice.
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:06.200]   Yes.
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:07.200]   Wouldn't we all?
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:13.560]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, usually around 230 Pacific 430, I'm sorry, 530 Eastern.
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:16.480]   That is 2130 UTC.
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:19.680]   You can tune in to twitter.tv/live as long as YouTube's up.
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:20.680]   We have Twitch though.
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:21.680]   We have mixer.
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:22.680]   We have Ustream.
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:24.040]   There's other ways you can watch.
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:27.680]   You can also listen live thanks to Spreaker.
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.680]   And who else?
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:31.120]   Spreaker and Tux.
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:32.120]   Who else do we have?
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:34.200]   We have a live stream, two live audio streams.
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:35.920]   I can't remember.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:36.920]   Tune in.
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:37.920]   Tune in.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:38.920]   That's it.
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:39.920]   Tune in, Spreaker.
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:41.160]   Sorry, tune in.
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:44.040]   You can also go to the chatroom@irc.twit.tv.
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:48.960]   That's where all the kids who are watching the show live, hang in and hang out.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:51.160]   If you want to be in studio, we had a great studio audience.
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:53.240]   All you have to do is email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:55.320]   We'll make sure there's somewhere for you to sit.
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:20:00.760]   It's a good idea to email ahead of time only because if I'm not here, the studio is not
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:01.760]   open.
[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:02.760]   We don't want you to get turned away.
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:05.960]   So please email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:07.440]   One last plug, if I wouldn't mind.
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:08.440]   Sorry.
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:11.200]   I want to say a big thank you to Standard Library.
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:13.040]   That's who actually paid for my flight out here.
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:16.640]   So thank you, Standard Library, for bringing me to Petaluma.
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:17.640]   Thank you.
[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:18.640]   What is Standard Library?
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:24.960]   Well, they've shown me some things that I can't talk about, but right now they allow
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:30.480]   you to make really easy API-level.
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:34.680]   They paste together things for Slack and for Slack rooms.
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:40.000]   So you don't actually need to be a developer to make tools that you need to keep your team
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:41.000]   informed.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000]   Nice.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.280]   So it's a very low lift in order to get some really cool functionality.
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:50.280]   Thank you.
[02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:52.280]   Thank you.
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:55.280]   Thank you.
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:57.280]   Thanks to Michael from Durham and Lonnie and Alex.
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:58.280]   Lonnie's from Deerfield.
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:02.480]   Alex is from Cupertino to Seth and Fort Lauderdale.
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:03.480]   Blake from San Jose.
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:04.480]   Eric and Yvonne.
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:05.480]   I'm sorry Yvonne.
[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:06.480]   I hope it wasn't too painful.
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:08.000]   They're from Cincinnati.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:09.960]   Worry, who is from Israel.
[02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:10.960]   Thank you, Uri.
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:11.960]   James from London.
[02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:15.920]   Yeah, the visitors from all over was really nice to have you here.
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:17.120]   Thanks to all of you for listening.

[02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:30.640]   We always have Ian in the same shirt just for continuity's sake.
[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:34.080]   No, but when it twists on the front, I'm dreadfully embarrassed.
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:35.640]   It's a nice shirt.
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.560]   It's a nice shirt.
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:38.880]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:40.960]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:54.440]   No warriors and raptors.

[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:12.960]   Hold on Leo.
[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:16.960]   All the cameras are dead and the table is going up.
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:17.960]   What the hell?
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:20.960]   We need to read you that.
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:21.960]   Asabi.
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:22.960]   All right.
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:23.960]   Cameras are back.
[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:35.840]   All right, let me try that again.
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.920]   Take two.
[02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:41.400]   Good.
