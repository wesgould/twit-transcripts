[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.360]   You don't mind if we make this a short show, do you?
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.360]   Not won't be too short.

[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.080]   gesture labs and just a great guy to know and have around.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.000]   Hey Steve, this time on Skype.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.160]   Hey, I'm in living color now, right?
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.960]   Wow, and streaming Ustream.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.280]   Not right now, we had a little problem there.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.960]   Yeah, it's tempting.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.840]   You know what we're doing is we're ordering a T1,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.120]   which will be here April 14th.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   And then I will stream via a separate channel
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.240]   from the internet channel that we use for Skype.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.720]   I'm going to actually have three channels of us.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.000]   Cable mode, I'm a DSL mode, I'm a T1.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.520]   And we'll just figure out which is best for which.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.440]   But that will solve that problem.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.280]   Yeah, well I'm missing your video thing.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.200]   I have to sort of imagine what you're looking at.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.840]   You kind of got hooked on that.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.240]   You've been watching that.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.080]   Oh, totally.

[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.280]   Of course.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.600]   Also here, I'm really pleased to have him back.

[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.400]   When did you become the editor-in-chief of Make Magazine?
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.280]   From the very, very first issue.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.560]   How can I not know this?
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.360]   Well, my name is very small on the mast head.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.920]   You don't toot your horn enough, Mark.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.680]   Well, your partner in crime is the kid.

[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.280]   Exactly.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.000]   Which is great.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.440]   Phil is amazing and fantastic.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.680]   So you do work--
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.360]   He's like the Mick Jagger of Maker of the man.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.160]   Exactly, yeah.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.600]   You know, I sent a note off to Tim O'Reilly
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.080]   that when the first issue of Make came out,
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.240]   I just fell in love with it.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.680]   And I said, this should be a TV show.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.600]   Please, if you want--
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.640]   And I guess you've been talking about making a TV show for--
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.880]   Yeah, actually, we are doing a TV show
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.200]   with on public television with the Minnesota public TV folks
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.120]   up there.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.000]   And hopefully, it will launch this year.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.160]   And it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.720]   And Phil will, of course, be on it.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.600]   And it'll be the magazine brought to TV, lots
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.840]   of how-to projects and profiles of really cool makers
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.600]   and stuff like that.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.800]   So it's all moving forward.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.360]   Good.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.520]   Because it just seemed like a natural to me.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.880]   It's such a visual magazine anyway.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   So what's the Maker Fair?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.760]   What is that all about?
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.800]   Well, it's in San Mateo, California.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.480]   And it is where-- it's kind of like a giant science fair.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.840]   It's like a family fun event.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.000]   Last year, we had 40,000 people.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   This year, we think about 50,000 people will come.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.320]   And there are robots.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.520]   We have all sorts of electronic projects.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.400]   We have people-- we have a trampoline where you jump on.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.880]   And every time you jump on the trampoline,
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.760]   this giant fire machine shoots a huge ball of flame
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.520]   into the air.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.680]   Oh, geez.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.080]   Huge electric, a life-sized robotic--
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.320]   Sounds like you had Bart Pauline working for you there.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.280]   Is that the survival research labs?
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.360]   They came last year, actually.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.920]   And we expect them to come this year again, too.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   And they bring all sorts of crazy fire-belching robots
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.600]   that destroy each other and stuff.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.040]   We call him four fingers, Pauline.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.560]   Exactly.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.200]   That's crazy nuts.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.000]   He lost his thumb in a rocket fuel accident.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.520]   And yeah, he lost his thumb.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.280]   So he had his big toe amputated.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.160]   And that is his thumb now.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.200]   So when you shake his hand, you're actually shaking his thumb.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.520]   He lives just down there.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.400]   He lives in Petaluma now.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.200]   He's moved into Petaluma.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   That's right.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.160]   He moves his whole lab over there and everything.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.360]   You should check it out.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.160]   I'm invited to his wife's a good friend,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.880]   which worked at Tech TV with us.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.160]   Well, cool, Amy.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.840]   Amy's great.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.160]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.600]   I worked with her at Wired, too.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.080]   Right.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.360]   Right.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.760]   So small world.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.320]   Well, what in the make-your-fair is May 3rd and 4th
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.360]   at the San Mateo Expo Center?
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.440]   And I have tickets, but I'm going to be doing the radio show.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.280]   Maybe I'll send my kids down to set off belching balls of flame.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.080]   That would be cool.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   And you can visit it at makerfair.com.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.360]   And it's fair, F-A-I-R-E, which is kind of a play on Renaissance
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.320]   fair and also fair spelled that way,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.960]   means make and French.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.440]   Wow, I missed that.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.960]   That was too deep for me.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.320]   I completely missed that.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.760]   Wow.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.240]   All right.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.160]   I've got four tickets sitting in front of me.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.600]   So we're going to talk a little bit about the news.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.120]   Molly Wood is scheduled to join us in just a little bit.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.840]   We started a little early so I could get out of here.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.440]   I'm going to Australia tonight.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.760]   I'm looking forward to this.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.000]   This is going to be a lot of fun.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.120]   It's Michael Oland, who does the Adobe Photoshop Lightroom
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.480]   Adventure book.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.400]   Well, it's now books because it's an O'Reilly book.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.680]   The next one's coming out and he's
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.080]   going to take a bunch of photographers and me.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.640]   I'm not in that category, but I'll take pictures.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.560]   And we'll send back blog posts and so forth.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.240]   I don't think we'll have Twitter in the next couple
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.040]   of weeks because I will be in Australia.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.720]   Some of our shows are actually be on hiatus
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.200]   for the couple of weeks.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.160]   I'm calling it spring break minus the nudity and heavy drinking.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.520]   Well, maybe not actually.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.920]   Who knows?
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.840]   Michael's a party guy.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.200]   But I'm glad we could get together.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.040]   Devorek may also join us a little later on.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.440]   As I said, we're starting a little bit early.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.800]   I asked the guys what we should talk about first.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.680]   And he throws seems to be a good topic.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.480]   What is going on there?
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.440]   They introduced this new baggage handling system, I guess.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.040]   And there are now an estimated 15 to 20,000 stranded bags
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.560]   there that people can't get.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.160]   They have no access to them planes or taking off
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.840]   without the luggage being loaded on there.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.080]   Is there like a conveyor belt to a big room
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.200]   and they're just sitting in that room?
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.760]   Why can't they get them?
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.800]   I have no idea.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.200]   It's just one of those logistical nightmares.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.160]   Remember the den, when they opened the Denver airport,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.640]   they had problems like that.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.520]   But they didn't fly.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.440]   I mean, they waited until they fixed it.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.000]   Yeah, they're just taking off.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.320]   And what's happening also are the hotels around Heathrow
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.360]   are filling up really quickly.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.120]   And the hotels have started gouging the poor hapless
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.240]   stranded passengers.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.800]   And they're charging like 250 pounds a night for a room
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.280]   that typically costs 100,000.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.200]   Well, British Airways only gives you 100 pounds.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.040]   So you're kind of at a lucky--
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.840]   So that's crazy.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.960]   I mean, why are they not flying in this situation?
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.880]   I mean, why can't they do what they do when they lose bags
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.480]   in the first place, which is just to deliver them later?
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.880]   That's a good question.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.120]   I mean, they'll eventually find their way, right?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.520]   Well, I think part of it is they're canceling flights.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.360]   They've canceled 37 flights today.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.920]   The total number of cancellations, 245 flights.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.480]   But you're right.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.480]   Why can't they just go without their bags?
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.040]   I don't know.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.840]   Maybe there's other problems as well
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.160]   with this new terminal.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.960]   Heathrow's always been a nightmare anyway.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.080]   I hate Heathrow.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.840]   But this is--
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.600]   Yeah, with just lines and--
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.040]   Just appalling.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.360]   So--
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.920]   Might be a room with people filling up.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.040]   I think they said today that 400 employees came in on their day
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.640]   off to sort through 15,000 stranded bags,
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.440]   sitting inside the new terminal just to figure out
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.440]   who they belong to.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.760]   Oh.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.120]   So Corey, Dr. O, my co-editor at Boing Boing,
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.000]   said that if you can't afford it,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.840]   you should always fly business class at Heathrow,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.400]   because the check-in terminals are on the opposite side
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.000]   of the building.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.440]   And they have special guards.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:07.760]   Of course.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.440]   And if you take Virgin Air business class,
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   they actually will take the limousine right out
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.400]   onto the tarmac.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.280]   And they have their special guards there.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.520]   And just get right on the plane.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.440]   You completely avoid the riff-raff.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.800]   They didn't search for their bags.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.720]   We've got to--
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.640]   Oh, James!
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.520]   I think that's definitely the way to go.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.800]   But who could afford it?
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.760]   I'm interested in the Corey can.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.960]   Yeah, well, I think that when he does his speaking gigs,
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.320]   he just puts that into the--
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   Makes him pay.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.120]   Right, or yeah.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.560]   Exactly.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.920]   April Fool's is a Tuesday.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.360]   That's when I arrive in Tasmania.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.800]   I thought I'd make my website upside down for April Fool's
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.480]   Day, since I'm down under.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.640]   The first April Fool's joke, though,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.160]   has already hit the airwaves.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.280]   Was anybody fooled when Kevin Rose announced that Revision 3
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.880]   had been sold to Fox News on Dignation?
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.960]   It shouldn't do April Fool's jokes, though, before April 1st.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.840]   That's cheating to do that.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.360]   The rules are that you have to do it between midnight and midnight.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.600]   Otherwise, it's just a dirty trick.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.080]   It's not a prank.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.840]   Well, there's some sort of a prank that was set up
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.880]   for Jonathan Schwartz that he talks about on his blog.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.040]   He's the president or the CEO of Sun Microsystems.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.080]   And if you go to his blog, you'll
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.200]   see that he's anticipating something happening tomorrow
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.440]   with some incriminating video that was shot of him.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.320]   And he knows it's out there.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.880]   Yeah, evidently he wasn't pleased,
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.840]   but he's trying to figure out how to not fire the guy who
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.280]   did it with his CFO or something.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:40.880]   Uh-oh.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.400]   Uh-oh.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   Good.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.480]   I can't tell which part of this is the joke.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.200]   It's exciting.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.000]   I love this.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.280]   The folks that make must go crazy with April Fool's.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.440]   And Boeing Boeing, too.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.160]   You guys, you're all jokesters.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.560]   You know, we actually--
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.840]   I don't think we've pulled any pranks
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.000]   on Boeing Boeing on April Fool's just
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.320]   because I think people would be expecting it.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.160]   We just couldn't get anything past them.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.040]   Phil usually comes up with something pretty good
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.720]   on the make blog that just teeters on the edge of credibility.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.320]   Last year, I said that Twitter had been sold to G4,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.400]   which was somewhat credible, to Comcast.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.480]   And maybe too credible because a lot of people believed it.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.200]   I had actually-- you know, I had things like--
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.360]   Dvorak does this, too.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.840]   He always does his April Fool's Common.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   He'll always have a press release by Slurp a Fool's Sloof,
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.240]   which is April Fool's backwards, right?
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.840]   And that's a giveaway, right?
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.960]   And so I said, you know, Spokesman, Slurp a Sloof said
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.720]   and whatever.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.640]   Then I had a picture of G4 and Twit shaking hands
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.280]   and all this.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.480]   And people bought it.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.000]   I had to actually--
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I had to put a little thing, a bug on the thing saying,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.120]   no, this is a joke.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.840]   I'm not selling out the G4.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.360]   It's amazing.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.520]   You would think that, you know, on April Fool's people
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.360]   would have their antennas fully extended.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:11:59.880]   Right.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.760]   But this kind of stops.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.920]   Sneaks up on you.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.160]   Not believe anything.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.880]   Sneaks up on you.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.560]   How about you, Steve?
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.320]   Do you do anything special for April Fool's?
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.040]   Yeah, I try not to read anything.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.640]   Just keep it away from my eyes so that I don't get pissed off.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.200]   This is not a joke, although I imagined newspapers
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.080]   wish it was.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.840]   Did you read The Long Piece by Eric Alterman?
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.120]   I thought a very good piece in The New Yorker
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.600]   on the death of the American newspaper.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.920]   It's coming faster than anybody imagined,
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.040]   I think because of the cost of ink and print
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.360]   and because of the success of blogs and other news sources
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.880]   online.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.040]   But also the success of things like your show.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.720]   I mean, this is--
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.600]   But we don't do-- you know, think
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.640]   as we don't do news.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.440]   We don't create-- we don't do any research or any reporting
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.880]   or any enterprise stuff.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.120]   We just-- we need primary sources.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.880]   I don't actually do any work.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.960]   We're just, you know, BSing on something we read.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.760]   But isn't that what a lot of blogs are doing?
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.600]   So who's going to be the primary source anymore?
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.120]   You're right.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.480]   That is a problem.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.240]   You know, boing, boing really depends on primary sources.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.160]   And I've always thought that there's kind of a virtuous circle
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.840]   between bloggers and newspapers because they help
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.320]   each other advance stories all the time.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:13.680]   I--
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   Yeah, but--
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.080]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.600]   No, you go ahead.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   Well, I was just going to say, I think,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.120]   did that ultimate's article mention Craigslist
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.400]   as a cause of the death of newspapers?
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.880]   That's what's really killing it, isn't it?
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.160]   Yeah, classified ads.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.000]   I mean, that's where they make all their money, right?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.680]   Right, right.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.320]   So it's so--
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.680]   Somebody made a point a couple months ago about that argument,
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.880]   which is that if the mainstream media had just dedicated
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.160]   a small unit to go out and build a website
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.800]   and do what Craigslist did and just
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.960]   confront their head on that they would have kept it in house.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.720]   But that's what's going on in general,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.040]   which is that these old business models die hard.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.360]   They don't get it that they're threatened.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.000]   They don't act promptly.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.120]   The record industry didn't.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.960]   And as a result, they shouldn't.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.360]   They don't need to get beat, but they do.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.240]   But we have the advantage of having
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.720]   watched the record business go--
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.440]   True, you think.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.200]   Completely suicidal.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.160]   And the movie business is doing a semi-bad job of it
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.080]   as opposed to an incredibly bad job.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.960]   And maybe the publishing business
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.240]   will finally come into alignment with these guys.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.080]   You know who's really scared is radio.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.480]   Radio's convinced that that's dead.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   And of course, this week, the Department of Justice
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.960]   said yes to the XM. Serious murder.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.160]   Still one more shoot a drop.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.200]   The FCC has to say yes to, although it seems likely,
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.240]   with the DOJ getting out of the way that this will happen.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.840]   And that just-- that, in addition to internet radio,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.680]   just terrifies terrestrial radio.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.280]   People aren't listening anymore.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.200]   Interesting.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.000]   Do you have your radio show on a satellite?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.920]   It's syndicated.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.520]   It's on XM.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.880]   But it's also on terrestrial radio.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.600]   But interestingly, nobody's stopped me yet.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.800]   I also put out a podcast, commercial-free podcast, of it.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.920]   But people like live.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.480]   I listen to it on the podcast just because I kind of--
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.120]   It's convenient.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.680]   --ship everything.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.640]   So do you have more listeners on the satellite?
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.960]   I don't have ratings for terrestrial versus satellite.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.200]   So I don't know who listens more there.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.920]   But certainly more people listen live
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.160]   than listen on the podcast.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.800]   Podcasts about 50,000 people, which
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.280]   is 1/10 to 1/20 the total numbers.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.840]   So that's the thing.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.360]   I don't know if radio is really in trouble.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.480]   I spoke to a radio convention a couple weeks ago.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.320]   And I said, I don't think you're in trouble.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.720]   In some ways, what you're doing, it fits in very well
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.320]   with the internet.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.400]   It's interactive.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   Talk radio, especially, is it's about communities,
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.560]   about interaction.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.560]   You can use the internet.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.320]   This is that same thing you're talking about, Steve.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.080]   If you would just pay attention, it's an opportunity,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.600]   not a challenge.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.000]   Right.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.360]   I mean, public radio for all of their--
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.720]   I mean, they have such an embedded,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.720]   lead-eyed view of the universe that they
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.080]   are the arbiters of what is tasteful, et cetera.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.560]   But even they have come sort of screaming
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.960]   to the party with podcasting.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.920]   Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   Let me add Molly Wood, because she's now online.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.680]   It's very interesting, because when I first--
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.400]   at the first podcast Expo, I talked to the NPR guys.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.440]   And they were very-- the only thing they were doing
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.680]   is little chunks.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.840]   They were-- hey, Molly Wood, how are you?
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.520]   Good, how are you?
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.560]   Well, it's great to have you.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   We're already halfway-- not halfway, but we've already begun.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.720]   Let me say--
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.120]   that's all right.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.640]   We started early, because I know you have to leave early.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.080]   And then here I am, you know.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.560]   You're late.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.880]   That's OK.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.320]   You're on time.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.720]   Steve Gilmore is here, and also Mark Fronfeld.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.200]   Hi, Molly.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.400]   And we've been talking about--
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.240]   I don't know if you read this.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.720]   It is online, which is kind of nice.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.200]   The New Yorker is smart.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.880]   The New Yorker is putting stuff online now.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.200]   And Eric Alterman's excellent piece
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   on the death and life of the American newspaper out of print
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.240]   is online, as well as in the New Yorker.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.360]   We've been talking about the future of newspaper.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.800]   One of the things Alterman says or points out
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.080]   is, according to Nielsen, the Huffington Post
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.800]   is more popular than all but eight newspaper sites.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.200]   So think blogs are really becoming-- even though they--
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.000]   they aren't exactly news gathering.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.120]   Or is Huffington more of a news gathering site than a blog?
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.320]   It seems like it's more opinions on--
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.160]   It's opinion, isn't it?
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.760]   It happens.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.320]   They have to find that news somewhere.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.360]   What about Politico?
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.760]   That's been getting a lot of--
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.880]   I wasn't aware of them until I saw them all over the TV.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.640]   They sponsored one of the debates, even.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.440]   Politico is an interesting data point here,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.960]   because they were the first to really identify
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.400]   in a very powerful article the fact
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.440]   that Hillary has virtually no chance of winning.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.120]   And that became the news.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.200]   Right.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.440]   That was then taken by the cable networks in particular.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.960]   And pitched as a tipping point in the actual campaign.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.680]   And interestingly enough, Eric's brother, John Alterman,
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.840]   who writes for Newsweek, who took this campaign up
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   and really took the banner up and said,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.120]   "Hillary can't win."
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.440]   And now it's the story.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.360]   But so there's a case where Politico is actually
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.520]   making is doing the research.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.000]   They're doing the enterprise reporting.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.520]   I mean, in this case, they're doing math.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.480]   It's not like they had to make any phone calls,
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.160]   but nevertheless--
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.360]   But it was a heavily researched article,
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.280]   because they went and did exactly what their competitors
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.960]   in the so-called mainstream media were doing.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.080]   And they got the benefit of that.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.480]   They're also getting paid to do it,
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.040]   which is not the case with many bloggers.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.280]   Paid by what do you mean paid because they have advertising?
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.880]   I assume so.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.080]   Politico seems to be a business model site.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.360]   It's not just a labor of love.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.480]   Anyway, I was saying, when Molly joined us,
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.520]   I was saying that NPR, when I first talked to them,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.280]   were very leery about putting full-length programming
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.480]   like Fresh Air in this American life--
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.720]   well, this American life's not NPR, but like Fresh Air on.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.560]   And what they were afraid of is their local stations,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.960]   which depend on subscription revenue,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.880]   would lose that revenue, that they would revolt.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.920]   Because why should you pay KQED here in San Francisco
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.280]   a hundred bucks a year if you could just download the podcast
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.480]   for the show as a podcast?
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.400]   Well, it's the same issue that the television networks
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.080]   have with their local affiliates.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.240]   Why would the affiliates are kind of caught in the crossfire
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.360]   of putting network television online?
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.080]   So maybe, Steve, it's not so much that these people aren't
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.240]   aware of the threats that the new media posed,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.360]   but their hands are tied.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.240]   Well, there's this crossing the chasm,
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.400]   innovators dilemma problem.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.480]   I mean, it's a real one.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.640]   And it's very hard to--
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.440]   Microsoft cannot easily move to an on-demand office
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.000]   model without cannibalizing 40% of their revenue.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.480]   So it's the same thing in each of these media industries.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480]   Exactly.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.920]   The innovators dilemma, that's what they call it.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.920]   There are several business books,
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.840]   and I think they all say the same thing
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   with different titles.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.840]   Another big story.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.000]   Go ahead, Molly.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.200]   Oh, no, if you're going to move--
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.120]   I was going to say, have I come in just past the declaration
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.080]   that newspapers are indeed dead?
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.280]   Or are we trying to save them in today's show?
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.160]   I think they're dead.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.760]   I have to say, when I look at my Kindle
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.680]   and I can get all that content--
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.840]   I mean, well, wait a minute, let me put it this way.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.440]   I think print newspapers are dead.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.320]   Absolutely.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   But the New York Times, what the Times is doing--
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.480]   Saul Hansel is the editor of the bits section in the New York
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.680]   Times.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.240]   They're now breaking stories before it gets
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.920]   into the print book.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.320]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.040]   Yeah, so I think that what we're seeing is, as you say,
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.880]   the Kindle and the iPhone are becoming significant delivery
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.160]   mechanisms for newspapers.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.600]   That's only going to get worse.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.480]   They're going to get better and better portable devices that
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.960]   are easier and easier to read.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.160]   And why should you spend money on news printing?
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.360]   I remember when Arthur Oakes, Salzberger--
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.440]   I think it was a Salzberger's set a year ago--
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.840]   and 10 years, we won't be printing a paper version of the Times.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.160]   And I remember even Devorex saying, oh, he's crazy.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.800]   In fact, I wish Devorex were here because he is very strong.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.200]   And he believes the print versions will last.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.680]   I just-- I think--
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.120]   I think so.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.400]   I think they'll last, actually.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:23.760]   Really?
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   Do you like that?
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.720]   I think they'll--
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.280]   I personally still get two papers.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.000]   And know people who think I'm very quaint for doing so.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.360]   But I come from a family that is--
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.920]   that if the paper's not there in the morning,
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.760]   they go out and get it, no matter how early.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.720]   And because there are two generations still
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.080]   living in my family who cannot start their day
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.160]   without the daily paper.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.400]   And in fact, to read it on and off all day long.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.040]   And I think that there are still a lot of people
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.080]   like that out there.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.880]   So maybe that death is coming, but I
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.280]   think it's further out than we think it is.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.160]   Well, are you that way?
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.920]   Do you have to read the paper paper?
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.160]   You know, it's funny because I pay to get the paper paper,
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.320]   but I don't read it every day.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.400]   But I certainly-- I prefer it.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.840]   I prefer that scanability like that.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.240]   To me, the scanability of the newspaper
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.960]   is what will save it over the electronic version.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.520]   I can't stand looking at the paper one story at a time.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.280]   Yeah, I was just going to use the T-word to point out
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.040]   that in the T-word stands for Twitter,
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.160]   that with Twitter, I'm getting most of my news
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.680]   through links on Twitter, which are basically
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.880]   going into the item level.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.960]   RSS feeds, whatever it is that is carrying
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.320]   the specific information.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.800]   So as that happens, the viability
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:44.120]   of an aggregated print source or even an online website
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.640]   is really going to be under attack for the next few years.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.720]   That's an interesting model.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.880]   So you look at Twitter.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.720]   You use it like an RSS feed then?
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.160]   It's become the signaler of news.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.200]   It's the first place the news shows up.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.160]   It shows up here much before the cable networks get things.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.600]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.760]   When there's a mainstream source--
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.120]   Go ahead.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.840]   Is it a mainstream source for anyone, or is it sort of a very
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.080]   an even more carefully spliced agenda setting?
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.240]   Because you're getting that news then not, I assume,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.040]   from the Twitter.com homepage, but from the people
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.200]   that you follow?
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.720]   Exactly.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.280]   So there are micro communities that are forming,
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.800]   and it's a very elitist model at the moment.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.760]   But the mechanics of it can go vertical at any moment.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.560]   And in fact, that's already starting to happen.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.720]   Well, that is one of the things that's unusual about Twitter
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.160]   is you build your followers.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.720]   Or you build a list of people you follow.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.760]   So you control totally.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.440]   I mean, if you want people chattering about LOL cats all day,
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.640]   you could have that.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.280]   Or if you want somebody doing substantive news,
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.200]   you could follow those people.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.600]   And it becomes like a bunch of ships passing in the night.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.000]   You don't know what's going on in those communities,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.280]   and they don't know what's going on in yours.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.840]   Well, does that seem like an efficient model?
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.400]   I know I can't stand that the way you described it,
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.520]   sounds-- I mean, I guess I never would have thought
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.600]   that the newspaper version, the Wall Street Journal,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.360]   or New York Times elitist agenda setting
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.320]   would actually seem like a broader model.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   Well, there you go.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.440]   I mean, it sounds kind of horrible.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.040]   What do you need?
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.560]   What do you need for this to work?
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.680]   Self-selecting news is the death of news.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.840]   Well, that's the problem, isn't it?
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.920]   Because you only would-- you don't have to follow somebody
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.440]   who says something you don't like.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.680]   But I know that we're-- it's scary,
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.640]   but I think you need to get into the idea.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.560]   If it's self-selecting, and if those micro communities
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.400]   have power, then the business models will follow.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.120]   Well, I believe that.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.600]   I'm not saying-- I'm not talking about business.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.760]   I guess I'm not-- this is the difficulty
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.680]   we often get into.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.320]   There's the business conversation, which
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.000]   is our newspapers out of business.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.840]   But there's-- then, though, I think
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.400]   there's a larger social issue of, is this a good thing?
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.160]   I mean, and that comes down to things like, well,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.960]   where do we get our primary news from if there's
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.360]   nobody paying for reporters?
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.840]   Well, that's my point.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.600]   My point is that the issue is about funding--
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.520]   Right.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.160]   Journalists.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.840]   Ultimately, yeah, you're right.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.360]   And if you have a micro community, which
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.520]   has a very high yield and CPM, essentially,
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.480]   that'll fund journalism.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:23.920]   But how?
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.420]   What?
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.840]   I mean, am I going to pay somebody--
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.000]   How will it fund the reporters?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.680]   All it seems to do to fund to me is the linking.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.400]   And then not-- and then when you back it out,
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.840]   pretty soon you've got no one funding the content
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.040]   and the content creation.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.920]   So you're all linking to the same story,
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.680]   but the story itself may be utter crap.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.000]   Well, I would suggest that the New York Times has been founded
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.920]   and funded as an international--
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.440]   I mean, I think probably 60% of the cost of the New York Times
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.720]   is in carrying the overseas international bureaus.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.200]   I mean, that's not-- that's an eliteist organization.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.800]   And it's worked pretty well.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.320]   They funded by--
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.640]   make turning it into a national newspaper
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.360]   and moving toward an online model that
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.840]   supports a broader audience around the things
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.960]   that people in this country are interested in,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.520]   the horse race of the campaign, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.040]   And they're using that to fund the serious journalism that
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.360]   goes on in the margins.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.560]   Well, draw a picture for me 10 years out
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.200]   of what news gathering is going to look like,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.840]   where it's going to be printed, how we're going to talk about it,
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.600]   how we're going to consume it.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.000]   Where are we going?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.760]   Well, let's say Molly, since she's the one who's scared.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.360]   She's the one who wants her newsprint,
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.480]   who wants inked fingers.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.120]   Well, or Mark, because Mark publishes a magazine,
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.920]   you're making a print magazine.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.440]   I mean, you have those same issues.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.640]   Yeah, well, it's interesting.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.880]   The print magazine does well.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.400]   It's grown really fast.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.760]   We have a paid circulation of about 100,000.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:06.480]   And I think the nature of the magazine,
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.640]   the how-to projects and the sizes,
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.680]   like the old popular science magazines,
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.600]   is a little bit larger than a digest-sized magazine.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.080]   Makes it kind of handy to carry around
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.760]   when you're working on a project.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.840]   Do you think that people read make actually make these things?
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.440]   Isn't it kind of more aspirational?
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.200]   I mean, that's how I read it.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:27.960]   That would be cool.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.080]   Or, like, someday I'll make that.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.840]   I do think that the majority of people don't make it,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   don't make the projects.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.600]   And they just read it.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.880]   And they kind of are living through the people
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.400]   who are actually making it.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.560]   But, you know, I get lots of email from people
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.160]   who make the stuff.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.640]   And so there are quite a few people out there making.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.960]   They want paper.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.200]   Yeah. And I think just for this kind of a magazine,
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.840]   paper is so great to flip through and look at.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.000]   There's something, you know, when you get online
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.760]   on a computer, you just have this urge to click
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.920]   and not read.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.520]   You know, I have that same thing myself.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.840]   If I'm reading an article from the New York Times online,
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.880]   I'm constantly wiggling my mouse cursor around
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.520]   and double clicking and things like that.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.200]   That's a syndrome. I was just reading about that.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.480]   The Hyperactive Mouse Syndrome.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.200]   Yeah, I've got it.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.440]   Is it related to the leg thing?
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like,
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.320]   what is it they call that?
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.160]   Jumpy leg.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   That's like syndrome.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.440]   Restless leg. I have restless mouse syndrome.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.320]   When Stuart Johnson were called the jimmy legs.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.560]   (laughing)
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.400]   To you.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.760]   So it sounds like both you
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.960]   and Molly believes that print is here to stay.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.280]   I guess it is, right?
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.640]   Well, I mean, it certainly has survived many predictions
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.480]   of its death, right?
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   But maybe it's generational.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.560]   My kids maybe don't need paper.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.920]   Maybe they don't have restless mouse syndrome.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.240]   Or maybe they do and they don't care.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.240]   Maybe they have short attention spans
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.760]   and they just click, click, click, click, click.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.960]   Well, I mean, I think it sort of kills me,
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   but I think the future of kind of the self-selecting feed
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.240]   is probably going to come to pass.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.600]   I mean, I think it's gonna take my argument for papers
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.080]   that it will take a lot longer than we think,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.640]   probably to finally go ahead and kill it off,
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.240]   just nostalgia and the generational gap alone.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.160]   I think we'll keep it alive longer than we think it's going to.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.040]   But the reason I think it worries me is just
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.800]   the narrowing of the news.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.000]   I mean, didn't that journalism study
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.880]   also find that people are in fact,
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.920]   despite this kind of concept of the long tail
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.600]   where all the information is available
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.280]   to anyone who wants to consume it,
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.760]   that people are reading about the same eight subjects
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.680]   and that their consumption of information is narrowing.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.760]   And I think part of that is because
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.120]   as we self-select our feeds,
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.640]   the echo chamber effect just increases exponentially.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.280]   And pretty soon you feel like you can only talk
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   about what everyone else on Twitter is talking about
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.240]   and you never actually get exposed to anything else.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.440]   And the long tail concept actually
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.600]   is kind of flipped on its head.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.840]   It becomes almost the opposite of the potential.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.040]   We just all have our own little fat tails.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.080]   Yeah, and it's like this weird,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.720]   it's just a peer pressure loop.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.560]   Right.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.840]   No, I think it's somewhat true.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.000]   I don't follow people who say things that are offensive to me,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.440]   even if it's politically offensive or,
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.800]   I guess I don't follow people I don't agree with.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.640]   Right, whereas I get the Wall Street Journal,
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.360]   even though I disagree with it.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.320]   It's opinion pages almost completely.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.680]   I skip the opinion pages.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.800]   I skip the fact that I get that paper.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.000]   Sometimes leads me to read the opinion pages
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.360]   and then yell back at them.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.800]   But I think that's really valuable.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.000]   I think it's a valuable exercise.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.240]   Well, I think you just sort of go ahead.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.080]   Oh, I was just gonna say,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.720]   it really is great having that dead tree version
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.400]   on your table and the serendipity value
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.080]   of coming across certain articles is fantastic.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   And it's a lot harder to do that with an online version,
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.640]   or through RSS or Twitter or whatever.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.920]   So I think that we're all basically saying
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.080]   what is going to happen,
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.600]   which is print is gonna survive.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.520]   It's going to be the loss leader for the brand
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.160]   and it's gonna be subsidized by these micro communities.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.400]   Let me read you what Eric Alterman said in The New Yorker,
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.920]   'cause I think we're coming
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.560]   to the exact same conclusion he came to.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.880]   He says, "So we're about to enter
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.680]   "a fractured, chaotic world of news,
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.080]   "characterized by superior community conversation,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   "but a decidedly diminished level of first rate journalism."
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.960]   The transformation of newspapers from enterprises
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.760]   devoted to objective reporting to a cluster
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.560]   of communities each engaged in its own kind of news
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.520]   and each with its own set of truths
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.640]   upon which to base debate and discussion
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.880]   will mean the loss of a single national narrative
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.000]   and a creative concept of facts
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.240]   by which to conduct our politics.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   That's an interesting point we hadn't mentioned.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.840]   News will become increasingly red or blue.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.520]   He also says, "There'll be serious losses.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.360]   "You'll lose those serendipitous encounters
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.600]   "that you were talking about."
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.520]   And he brings up one point that I hadn't really thought about,
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.160]   but I think is very interesting.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.720]   He says, "What becomes of those people at home
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.640]   "or abroad who depend upon journalism
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.800]   "to keep them safe from oppression or injustice?"
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.280]   And there is a very important role to journalism
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.260]   in that regard.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:34.280]   - Yeah, that's a very interesting point.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.240]   Well, because what becomes of journalism
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.200]   and there's this idea of sort of a journalistic imperative,
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.120]   which is to uncover and expose.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.440]   And if that imperative becomes changes
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.280]   and evolves into--
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.000]   - Who can get the gossip out first?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.280]   - Who can get the gossip out first
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.840]   and who can further the analysis,
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.280]   who can kind of advance the conversation
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.760]   or start the conversation,
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.960]   who can be first post.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.440]   - Right, first post.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.200]   - It is that first post mentality.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.480]   - Yes.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.800]   - Then we do lose that.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.280]   And not all of that is good.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.000]   I mean, I went to journalism school
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.400]   and my senior thesis class was,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.040]   it became very clear that post Watergate
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.840]   every graduating journalism student's desire
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.600]   was to bring down a president.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.440]   - Right.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.760]   - And that's not a good instinct all the time.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.600]   But it has--
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.960]   - They all got jobs by the way.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.800]   - They have a lot.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.760]   - Yeah, they've got all good stuff.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.640]   But it's nevertheless the pretty important instinct.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.080]   It has been an important instinct
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.760]   in bringing light and information to the world.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.600]   - It'd be interesting.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.320]   It's clearly we're in a change, phase change right now.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.920]   It's very interesting to see what's gonna happen.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.880]   I think it's kind of unpredictable.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.000]   I'm gonna pause this discussion,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.800]   a great discussion about the future of journalism
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.960]   to talk about our sponsor briefly.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.200]   Then we'll get back to it audible.com/twit.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.080]   You know about audible.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.880]   They're the greatest place to get your audio books,
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.200]   all kinds of titles, 45,000 strong.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.280]   Now, we've got a new URL I wanna try out on you.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.400]   There are two offers.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.760]   Somebody sent me an email and said,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.560]   you know, you're offering the free book and that's good,
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.600]   but you can also, there's a different offer
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.920]   that you might wanna offer your, that audible offers,
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.200]   you might wanna offer your listeners.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.160]   And so I asked Audible and they said, sure.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.360]   So here's your two different deals.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.360]   You can go to audible.com/twit,
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.720]   sign up today if you're a new user,
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.480]   you'll get a credit for a free book.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.280]   And I'll tell you what a book I can recommend
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.600]   in just a second.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.240]   But there is another way to do it.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.000]   If you want at least three audio books
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.960]   with a 50% discount and you'd have to figure out
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.640]   whether this is a better deal or not,
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.200]   depending on what books you want,
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.960]   go to audible.com/twit, 749.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.160]   That's because you get half off,
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.040]   your membership in Audible is $7.49 a month
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.800]   for the first three months
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.000]   and it includes a book credit a month.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.480]   That might be a better deal, actually.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.320]   Give it a try.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.840]   Audible, this is just a different way to go.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.800]   Audible.com/twit, 749.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   Join Audible for three months at just $7.49
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   and you get a book credit a month.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.840]   That's 50% off.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.080]   I think that's a pretty good deal.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.600]   Now, let me talk about a book you might want to read.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.640]   Given our discussion on the future of media,
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:22.300]   this is a fantastic lecture series that I listened to.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:27.160]   The Library of Congress series on the digital future.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.080]   It's a collection of lectures,
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.280]   eight lectures hosted at the Library of Congress
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.320]   from some of the most interesting people, I think,
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.160]   in the business.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.600]   Let me tell you who you're going to hear from.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.520]   This was recorded about three years ago,
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.440]   but it is not out of date.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.440]   David Weinberger, who was one of the guys
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   who wrote the Clutering Manifesto.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.360]   He was an internet advisor to Howard Dean,
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.960]   Brewster Kale, who founded the internet archive,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.800]   and is actually literally archiving the internet.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.840]   Larry Lessig is on this, talking about the copyright
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.120]   and copyright.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.000]   This is a fantastic series.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.080]   Eight lectures by some of the best minds.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.720]   I really enjoy these 12 hours.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.920]   It's not a book.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.760]   It's a lecture series.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.040]   That's one of the things I want to let you know about Audible.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.040]   This is not just books.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.400]   They have radio shows, lecture series,
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.520]   the presidential debates,
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.760]   they've lots of different material.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.240]   But all for listening.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.560]   Plays on your iPod, your iPhone,
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.640]   a variety, hundreds of different devices.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.880]   Audible.com, there are two different ways to do this.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.080]   Again, Audible.com/Twit,
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.120]   for the standard offer, a free book, when you sign up.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.080]   These are both of these are for new members only, by the way.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   Or Audible.com, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Twit749,
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.760]   the number is 749.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.960]   And that's for the half-off offer for the first three months.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.760]   We do thank him so much for the support.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   Audible.com/Twit749, you take a pick,
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.400]   whichever you prefer, and we thank Audible.com.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.000]   So now, Steve Gilmore,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   because we were having trouble with his Skype connection,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.160]   is because he has a...
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.800]   I'm going to AT&T tomorrow.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.520]   We've put him on the phone.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.040]   Your final thoughts, Steve?
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.320]   Yeah, I was just trying to push back a little bit
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.200]   on what Molly said.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.440]   What she's describing when she talks about reading
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.720]   the journal, which I do every day,
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.960]   as well as the New York Times.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.720]   And most of it online these days,
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.400]   is that that's a fairly elitist sort of newspaper
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.480]   or journalistic focus point of view,
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.320]   and it is a large audience.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.720]   And it will continue regardless of what these new medias are.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.040]   So I really don't think that the depth
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.960]   of investigative journalism is going to come,
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.160]   is going to proceed quite as quickly as might be suggested.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.440]   Well, and also, I mean,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.640]   sometimes unconventional citizen journalism is better.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.240]   Look at the Tibetan monks story.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.000]   I think a lot of times there are, you know,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.040]   as more and more people are empowered to cover these stories,
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.880]   not with journalistic training admittedly,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.320]   but with the tools to gather the news,
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.880]   we in some ways do have better primary sources.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.520]   But I do think that, you know,
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.240]   Dave had taken the other side for a second.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.200]   The ability to fund a serious,
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.040]   I mean, for example,
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.120]   there's been this issue in the blogosphere recently.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.480]   Dave Weiner and others trying to get the newspapers
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.000]   and the people who are allowed on these conference calls
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.440]   with the candidates to be able to publish those MP3s
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.680]   that are resulting.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.760]   And it hasn't been easy.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.400]   I think that we're getting there finally.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.600]   But, you know, there's a question of access.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.720]   And the major companies are,
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.080]   because of their clout,
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.600]   are provided access that some of these citizens
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.400]   and journalists just can't get.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.720]   Tell people what Dave's been trying to do,
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.080]   'cause that's an interesting story.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.480]   Yeah, basically there are these conference calls
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.080]   that the candidates, the campaigns put on every day,
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.880]   where, you know,
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.760]   Wolfson from the Clinton campaign,
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.120]   or I forget who it is from the Obama campaign,
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.520]   and somebody from the McCain campaign will basically
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.960]   do a round table with specific chosen journalists.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.040]   And these are recorded, of course,
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.360]   by the journalists so that they can file their stories
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.440]   without having to remember it all or take, you know,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.840]   elaborate notes.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.480]   So the recordings exist,
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.600]   and Dave has been trying to get people at the times
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.320]   and also at McClatchy, I believe,
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.440]   and others to, you know,
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.400]   provide those in a form where they can be distributed
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.120]   on the Twitter network.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.640]   And because Dave is such a diplomatic, easy-going fella,
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.600]   he's having great success.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.240]   Actually, I know that there's a touch of humor in that,
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.800]   but he is actually having some great--
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.120]   Yeah, no, I'm glad he's,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.440]   what he really is is the bur in the saddle.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.360]   And I'm really glad that he's doing that.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.240]   Well, it's really interesting,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.560]   because I think in that argument about,
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.160]   I know I'm just belaboring this conversation,
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.640]   but it's so interesting.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.720]   In that whole fight between kind of, you know,
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.000]   what is a traditional journalist and what is a blogger
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   and what's the difference and why is there a difference,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.600]   a lot of journalism does come down to access.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.800]   Just fundamentally having the name recognition,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.960]   like you said, Steve, to get the access.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.880]   And so it's not that, you know,
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.760]   journalism training makes you sort of somehow more skilled
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.600]   at getting access, although that is part of it,
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.520]   it's just that you work for someplace that gets you in the door.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.560]   So there are sort of two possible scenarios for the future
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.160]   where everyone's a journalist and anyone can kind of
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   have this access to the news.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.760]   And I guess one is that anyone would be granted that access,
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.400]   that we do have to have these mechanisms
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.600]   for universal access to anyone who comes calling,
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.960]   or, you know, the kind of there's the doomsday scenario
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.120]   wherein Mark Cuban leads the way
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.440]   and you start blowing an altar, so all bloggers.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.680]   And you say like, okay, I don't know who to give access to,
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.160]   so it's no one.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.320]   And then, you know, we have the death of investigative journalists
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.560]   because no one can investigate.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.720]   - The problem is that the nuclear winter scenario
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.000]   isn't gonna happen because these bloggers
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.680]   are just too damn noisy.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.040]   - Yeah, like Dave Weiner.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.680]   - Exactly, and the other side of it is that
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.280]   I really strongly believe that this is gonna be a hybrid
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.800]   because I've always viewed the, you know,
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.840]   I started writing for Bite Magazine
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.400]   about 25 years ago, God help me.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:28.400]   And I've written for a lot of the mainstream tech publications
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.600]   for a long time, and I've also been blogging
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.920]   for the last five years and doing podcasts, et cetera.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.800]   So I know both sides of this.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.960]   And to me, the blogosphere is like Vaudeville.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.240]   It's something where things bubble up.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.040]   People gain reputations.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.840]   They, you know, it's how the comedy clubs were
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.800]   in the late '80s, you know,
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.160]   and now all those people are running television.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.400]   This is an inexorable move toward so-called professionalism.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.000]   It comes with the territory.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.120]   - Interesting.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.080]   You're saying it's almost, it's the farm team.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.000]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.360]   It's the Kansas City A's for the New York Yankees.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.200]   - Hmm.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.480]   I wonder though, is it the farm team
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.980]   or is it the next Yankees?
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.600]   - Well, that's the question that
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.560]   Arrington has been asking in recent weeks.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.400]   - Yeah.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.360]   - Well, this is a great conversation
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.720]   and we have another podcast to call this week in media,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.000]   which also covers these subjects.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.240]   And I think, well, I like to talk about this more.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.400]   We will and maybe we'll do it on this week in media as well.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.720]   But, you know, it's, what's exciting about our time
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.040]   is that we are seeing so much change.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.560]   This digital revolution is changing so much
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.480]   in our lives.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.280]   So many business models are crumbling.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.280]   Let me ask you this in a broader scope.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.160]   Is it in general a positive move?
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.240]   Is it, is it, is there a lot of negative to it?
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.360]   Is it neutral?
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.280]   Mark, do you feel like, are you an optimist?
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.480]   - Yeah, I think I am.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   I get, you know, it's just increased my sources of information
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:08.000]   and I do think that there will always be an opportunity
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.840]   for good journalists to get paid somehow.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.360]   There will probably be some rough periods,
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.360]   but you know, with a combination of my using Google search,
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:22.120]   search words with RSS and RSSing a lot of different blogs
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.240]   and then reading print paper,
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.400]   people have a tremendous amount of variety
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.240]   and control over the news that they get.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.520]   And I think there's, you know,
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.600]   there's always going to be a way to make money from that.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.360]   And therefore there will always be a way for good journalists
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.200]   to get paid.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.440]   So in the long run, I am not worried at all.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.000]   And I know, it's gonna be weird for a while.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.320]   - It's gonna be weird.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.720]   I know Corey says that too.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.800]   He quotes the theater's sturgeon and said,
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.440]   90% of everything is crap.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.680]   But that means 10% of everything is great.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.960]   And if you have more everything,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.560]   then you're gonna have more great stuff.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.440]   - Sure, and I think that if people like some of that crap,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.280]   you know.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.000]   - Yeah, well, what my crap might be your,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.080]   foie gras.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.640]   - Well, I mean, you know, even though I don't want to admit it,
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.040]   I actually do like some of the gossip.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.600]   I read Valley Weg every day.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.640]   - Well, I wouldn't go back before.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.400]   - I was, I was at a, I was at a.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.440]   - Well, let's not get crazy.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.400]   - I was at a very high level meeting
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.920]   with some very high level CEOs.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.560]   And I was looking over the shoulder of one of them.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.280]   He was reading Valley Weg.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.720]   Not only was he reading it,
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.520]   but he was clicking the links to find out
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.560]   who is this person that Jimmy Wales has been seeing.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.280]   And I mean, if you look over people's shoulders,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.000]   you can see that people are reading this stuff.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.120]   They may not admit to it.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.240]   It's a dirty little secret.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.000]   It's like page six, you know, you gotta read that stuff.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.920]   - Guilty pleasure.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.760]   - Guilty pleasure.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.600]   How about you, Molly?
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.960]   Optimistic, pessimistic.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.520]   And I don't just mean journalism in general.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.440]   - Well, it's almost, yeah, it's interesting.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.120]   It's almost sort of not worth it to ask.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.520]   I guess if it's a good thing or a bad thing
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.640]   'cause it's so inevitable.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.560]   It's not like we're ever gonna sort of shove this back
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.400]   into the box.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.880]   And so we just sort of go on and see what comes of it.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.280]   - But we might be able to influence it,
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.080]   don't you think we could, or America, is it not?
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.280]   Is it not possible?
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.960]   - I think we can influence it to a certain extent.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.160]   Overall, I'm optimistic.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.520]   I mean, as much as I kind of may complain,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.440]   I personally might be a little bit of a journalism elitist.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.840]   And I wish that standards at some publications
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:27.760]   that I work near and/or with were as high as they had been
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.200]   or what have you.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.680]   I think that the internet and the worldwide web
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.120]   are the greatest thing that humanity has ever accomplished.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.360]   I mean, not to like wax a little melodramatic,
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.360]   but it's phenomenal the amount of information
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.240]   that we can access and that people can access,
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.000]   really disenfranchised, people can access.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.360]   So when it comes right down to it,
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.760]   the quality will sort itself out.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.560]   The fact that that information is there at all
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.120]   is kind of a modern miracle.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.320]   - This is when I wish we could have,
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.520]   we'd try to get Scott Rosenberg right before the show
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.440]   that I found her salon.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.160]   Here's a guy was a print reporter,
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.120]   founded salon, which is a, I in my opinion,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.920]   a journalistic landmark, a huge success.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   - Absolutely loves salon.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.240]   - Fantastic publication, which is, I guess, solvent,
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.200]   although maybe not very solvent,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.880]   but at least seems to be going on
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.400]   and is now writing about the blogosphere.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.000]   I think he would have a lot to say about this.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.600]   How about you, Steve, you two share that heritage.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.720]   Are you optimistic?
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.840]   - I wouldn't say, I mean, I know that's your question.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.200]   So I'm-- - You don't have to answer
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   my question, answer any question you like.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.160]   - Okay, well, I'll make up-- - Go political.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.000]   - Yeah. - For question
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.080]   and then I'll answer it, which is,
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.800]   I don't think that it's, you know, seriously,
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.760]   I don't think that it's about optimism.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.680]   I think what Molly says is exactly right,
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.880]   which is, it's gonna happen.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.320]   The question is, is what's gonna happen
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.600]   and how do we improve things?
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.160]   Because there will be a loss in terms of
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.160]   what I would call discoverability.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.200]   You know, the serendipity that Mark was talking about before.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:02.040]   And, you know, that is something that needs to be engendered
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.360]   in these new editorial models.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.720]   - I am gonna say, I'm very optimistic
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.320]   because of things like Twitter.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.000]   There is serendipity.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.200]   It is now more about people
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   and more about direct connections to personalities.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.440]   So instead of reading a newspaper,
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.040]   I read a person and I think ultimately,
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.160]   that's valuable.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.800]   I think if you have, if you're a curious mind,
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.640]   if you have interest in current events
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.880]   or what's going on,
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.320]   the fact that you can disintermediate these people,
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.040]   deal directly with them, follow them directly,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.240]   build your own newspaper,
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.080]   I think is better.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.120]   I don't think it's gonna become an echo chamber.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.200]   I don't think it's gonna be a common--
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.920]   - Well, I think that's exactly right.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.360]   I mean, look at what you're doing here.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.400]   You are essentially building a new broadcast network model.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.280]   And I mean, I'm--
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.800]   - And it's built around people I'm interested in.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.600]   And if you're interested in my kind of ethos,
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.640]   you might follow it.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.680]   But I guarantee you, there are people who listen to this show
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.000]   who, well, look when Dave was on it, who hated it.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.800]   I mean, Dave got a lot of hate mail,
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.720]   but I bet you he provoked some people
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.920]   to just thought.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.920]   - Yeah, I mean, the things that he discussed
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.520]   and that we all discussed will resonate to those people
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.280]   long after they get over whatever they felt
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.880]   was disagreeable about Dave's tone of voice
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.920]   or whatever it was that they were concerned about.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.280]   But the thing that I think we have to remember is that,
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.680]   you know, the Twitter universe is really, really
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.240]   time grabbing and crunching.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.000]   It's very difficult to be able to get a good, strong signal
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.520]   to noise without just sitting in front of the computer all day.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.320]   And there's a friend of yours in mind, Dave Schleucher,
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.600]   who's an early stage podcaster.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.240]   - And who has turned into a very cranky man.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.080]   I don't know what he's saying.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.920]   - Oh, yeah, he's--
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.760]   - He's worse than Dvorak.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.040]   - So on and so forth, but, well, worse than Dvorak.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:54.880]   Come on.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.680]   (laughing)
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.960]   But the thing is, is that he's been wrestling
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.440]   in recent days with resigning from Twitter,
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.240]   keeping it to 15 minutes a day.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.280]   And, you know, I just try and keep them on
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   as long as possible so that he gets crankier.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   (laughing)
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.720]   But the bottom line is that he's really,
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.280]   he's underlining what the issue is,
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.520]   which is how do you find an efficient way
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.720]   of getting to those, you know, bubbles
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.040]   and nuggets of information?
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.600]   - I think I found the way.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.680]   I think the--
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.520]   - Real cheap.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.960]   - I think that what's happening here,
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.800]   at some point there's gonna flip for you.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.400]   There is an old way of thinking
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.600]   that you have to somehow keep up
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.240]   that is really what's getting in your way.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.200]   You can't give up, release, let go.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.800]   However, if you bathe in this stream of information,
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.080]   you get plenty.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.360]   And so, email's a good example for me.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.560]   For a long time, I think a lot of people
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.680]   still have this crazy notion
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.840]   you've gotta answer your email
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.920]   and you've gotta read it all.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.760]   You can't.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.960]   (laughing)
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.120]   You can't give it up.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.240]   Do the best you can, read what you want,
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.320]   take what you want, you know,
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.400]   wade through this stream without holding on.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.160]   - But, you know, this is an incredible argument
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.840]   because you are, as--
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.680]   - Works for me.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.760]   - You are a canary in the mine shaft of this issue.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.680]   - Works for me.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.200]   - Well, I mean, but you're exposed
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.880]   to a tremendous amount of volume of all this stuff.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.640]   - And so what happened to me is I got burned out.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.840]   It was too much, I was at Dave Slusher's point
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.080]   where I was like, I quit, I did quit Twitter.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.640]   It was too much, it was a problem.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.240]   And now I'm just kind of relaxed into it
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.120]   and I just love it.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.520]   I just, I don't feel like the key is not worrying
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.040]   about missing something.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.440]   - Yeah, Leo, that is such great advice, you know.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.240]   With Make Magazine, I had a similar thing
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.640]   where I was freaking out
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.840]   because I would get all these story submissions
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.640]   and come across ideas that were like
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.080]   fantastic projects for the magazine.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.040]   And it was like this fire hose of stuff.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.440]   And I was like, flipped out about trying to get everything
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.320]   in there and then I just realized, you know,
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.720]   as long as everything in the magazine is good
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.200]   and I don't put anything bad in there,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.240]   I just have to realize that a lot of good ones
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.880]   are gonna get away, but the magazine is gonna be
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.880]   filled with good stuff and that's really best you can do.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.720]   - And I don't feel like that's giving up.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.800]   - No, it's not, it's not really giving up.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.160]   It's kind of letting go.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.520]   - It is letting go and it's celebrating, there's great stuff.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.160]   - Let me ask Mark a question.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.400]   What's your lead time on the magazine?
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.480]   - It's a quarterly, so we have a really long lead time.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.120]   In the articles, you know, since they're doing yourself,
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.360]   they're pretty evergreen, so that helps too.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.440]   - Yeah, I mean, my one enduring concern,
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.760]   if I have an area of pessimism in this whole conversation,
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.400]   it's, it is speed and it may sound, you know,
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.840]   sort of old fashioned, but I think that speed
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.520]   is the death of investigation and in some cases,
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.120]   the death of sort of accuracy.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.240]   And as we push for kind of faster and faster
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.440]   and faster information, there's just,
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.720]   it is not possible.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.680]   This is not a, this is not a knock on bloggers.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:01.880]   It is simply not possible to be both accurate
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.120]   and researched and also fast.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.720]   - No, but a cast is beyond a certain point.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.160]   - Again, I think these are pretty fast.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.320]   - I think these are birthing paints,
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.600]   something you know very well.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.080]   I think these are, how old's your baby now?
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.440]   - He just turned one.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.280]   - He's kicking the walls, I hear.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   - Yeah, he doesn't want to go to sleep today.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.480]   - Oh, little guy.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.640]   - I know, he's adorable.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.160]   - Oh, nothing like it.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.280]   But I think these are birthing paints.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.640]   I think we're still using old mindsets
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.000]   to try to absorb this information
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.920]   and try to make sense of it.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.720]   And I think what happens is, yeah,
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.360]   there's a lot of quick judgment and stuff.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.520]   What you have to do as a consumer is kind of know that
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.880]   and just kind of sit there.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.760]   So when I see Kevin Rose say Fox bought us,
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:52.560]   instead of twittering it, like Robert Scoville might do,
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.000]   I pause for a moment and say, oh, that's interesting.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.280]   Let me wait and see what else is said in the blogosphere.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.760]   - But that's great for you.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.600]   - But people will do that.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.720]   - But the fact is 20,000 people are following Robert Scoville.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.800]   And so if he does it.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.960]   - He'll learn.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.360]   - And they're a bunch of credible ninnies.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.760]   I mean, just you don't know.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.640]   - Well, and it could be a tidal wave, I guess.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.440]   But I think that what'll happen is,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.880]   it's what I'm saying is,
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.440]   that's 'cause we haven't learned it yet,
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.840]   but we will learn it.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:17.680]   - Yeah.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.200]   - I mean, I think that Robert is, you know,
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.400]   laying the groundwork for people,
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.320]   understanding the difference between a Shelman,
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.800]   which is what Robert is,
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.840]   and a credible source,
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.880]   which Robert is occasionally,
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.520]   and which there are some stars in that area.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.000]   I mean, when Mike Harrington,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.640]   who sort of, you know,
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.400]   straddles the border of these two issues,
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.360]   when he says something,
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.560]   it's usually well thought out, deeply researched,
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.080]   and about at least 80% accurate,
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.760]   which I challenge you to any mainstream
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.880]   of news organizations to do better.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   - You more understand, Mike,
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.200]   I'm not gonna be on that regard than I am,
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.360]   but nevertheless, I think you're right.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.600]   I think you have to know, consider the source.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.040]   So I believe me,
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.760]   Scobble's a great source.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.480]   I don't throw Scobble out.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.760]   I just know how to treat his,
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.880]   I understand his content.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.560]   And this comes down to,
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.720]   instead of, you know,
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.560]   when you read the New York Times,
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.200]   you understand the New York Times,
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.080]   when you read the New Republic, you understand it.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.120]   Well, now you have to understand the players.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.000]   So it comes down to that same kind of getting,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.600]   who Scobble is in this game,
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.120]   who Mike is in this game,
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.080]   who Steve Gilmore is,
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.400]   and then judging what you hear from them accordingly,
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.080]   and then putting together a picture on your own,
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.080]   I think people can do that.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.680]   I give people credit for being able to do that.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.320]   - I think that means that people will have to look,
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.240]   to work a lot harder than they had to in the past.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.080]   - Don't have to think.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.680]   - Because, because like you said, it is,
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.840]   that well, they will have to think,
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.200]   and I think that history has shown us in abundance
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.040]   that they don't like to--
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.760]   - Well, yeah, okay, but I write those people off.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.520]   If nobody, look, if somebody's not thinking,
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.440]   they're gonna get the wrong answer no matter what they read.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.840]   - And there will be a middle layer of what we call editors
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.000]   that will come in, you know, middle persons,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.960]   that will come in and provide that kind of aggregate,
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.120]   good read, that's what Mark's doing.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.040]   - Yeah, I used to think that,
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.400]   and I'm actually kind of against that now.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.320]   I think that I want the disintermediation.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.160]   Let yourself be the editor.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.000]   - I should have both, I mean--
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:05.840]   - Yeah, you can.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.400]   - You don't have to go to CNET or blind blind,
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.240]   or--
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.120]   - And editor is just another source, I guess.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.160]   - Well, there, you know, again,
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.200]   I think it comes down to the personality,
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.920]   as you get to know the people.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.800]   I mean, I used to, a dear friend of my mother
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.040]   was the film critic for the New York Post,
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:28.840]   Archer Winston, and Archer's reviews were,
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.040]   you know, if you're an idiot, you're gonna love this movie.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.440]   (laughing)
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:39.440]   And it basically, you know, I often read opinion
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.520]   and news sources, not because I think they're right,
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.680]   but because I think they're on, it's like Devorak,
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.280]   when he says it's time to sell, I buy.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.640]   - Right, but you know how to interpret it.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.480]   - Yeah, because--
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.000]   - That's using your noggin.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.880]   - It's not just that, it's that, you know,
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:01.280]   you get instincts about the people that you pay attention to,
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:05.480]   and it's a complex decision that you add that all up.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.440]   It's not something that's gonna yield
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.000]   to some sort of algorithm.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.360]   It's the brain's very intelligent.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.960]   - It's something we're good at,
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.240]   because what it really is doing
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.120]   is bringing it back down to the way it was,
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.480]   where you lived in a village, you had 150 people,
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.680]   you knew who to listen to, who not to listen to,
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.240]   who was silly, and you could put together
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.520]   a picture of the world from those voices,
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.200]   and it just brings us right back to that.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.800]   I think it's something we're actually better at
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.040]   than consuming mass media.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.120]   I don't think mass media served us very well.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.800]   I relish the collapse of mass media.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.640]   On that note-- - Wow.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.800]   - How about that?
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.320]   Let's move on, MacBook owned,
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.560]   or should I say pwned?
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.120]   I love this story.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.400]   Can SecWest, a security conference in Vancouver,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.640]   has a very fun game.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.960]   They call pwned to own,
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.320]   in which they take three computers,
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.880]   Vista, Mac, Ubuntu,
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.360]   unmodified stock computers,
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:03.280]   and give hackers a chance to own them.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.640]   Now, here's the deal.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.520]   In the first day, they have to own it
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.400]   just using the operating system,
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.560]   exploits built into the operating system.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.800]   On the second day, they're allowed to use applications
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.240]   that come with the computer,
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.640]   but it have to be made by Microsoft Apple or Ubuntu.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.520]   And on the third day, they get to use third party apps.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.560]   So day one, none of them are hacked.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.680]   Nobody could figure out how to hack any of them.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.080]   Day two, a hacker strolls in,
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.520]   his name is Charlie Miller,
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.800]   walks up to the MacBook Air,
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.240]   surfs to a website that he created,
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.680]   uses Safari to do this,
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.280]   website that he created.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.560]   Two minutes later, it's pwned.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.560]   He takes home $10,000,
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.880]   and a MacBook Air.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.120]   Pretty cool.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.720]   Presumably he'll run Firefox on.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.000]   So what is it that he's actually hacking?
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.960]   Like he gets like root access or--
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.080]   Yeah, gets root.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:55.920]   He pwns it.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.800]   Nothing on the Vista machine until day three,
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.840]   when you're allowed to use third party apps,
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.600]   and then another hacker uses Flash
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.800]   to own Vista, the Ubuntu machine stands alone, unhacked.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:10.920]   Isn't that a great contest?
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.000]   But what it's done is it sent a chill,
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.760]   and I know this 'cause I did the radio show today,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.680]   it sent a chill among Mac owners,
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:21.360]   who were saying, "Wait a minute, you mean I could get hacked?"
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.720]   Part of the deal on this-- Also, come on.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.120]   They don't get the $10,000 unless they sign an NDA
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.960]   saying we won't tell anybody how we did this
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.600]   until Apple gets a chance to fix it.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.280]   So we don't know exactly what happened.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.600]   It seems to be a fairly well-known bug in WebKit
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.400]   that Safari is based on.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.560]   But--
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.400]   It's a little scary.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.840]   Yes, Secunia has already identified, I think,
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.840]   two critical flaws in Safari for Windows,
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.720]   which it sounds like they may be similar.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.560]   I got a third flaw.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.640]   The Windows, did you see this?
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.200]   The Windows Yula for Safari?
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.800]   Apple put in the Yula, it must not be run
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.640]   on any computer that's not Apple, made by Apple.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.080]   They changed their mind on that shortly after that.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.600]   I mean, after they forced it to download it.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.000]   Forced you to download it.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.320]   Yeah, so they forced you to download it
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.120]   with its massive security flaws.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.360]   Ours Tech, thanks so much.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.880]   Yeah, they pushed it on everybody.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.920]   They didn't force you to download,
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.120]   but they sure bugged you until you did.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.600]   The Ours Tech--
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.480]   They didn't force you, but they tricked you.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.680]   I think they tricked a lot of people.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.240]   How did they trick you?
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.120]   Well, it was pre-selected as part of your Apple updater.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.240]   Yeah, so if you installed iTunes and QuickTime,
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.800]   which many Windows users have, because they have iPods,
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.160]   then the updater, which you also installed, last week said,
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.840]   oh, Safari 3.1 is out.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.160]   And by the way, there's some ad copy.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:35.960]   It's a better browser.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.040]   It's faster.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.000]   It says, would you like it?
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.880]   You could say, no, I said no twice.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.560]   Finally, I agreed.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.000]   Because it will not go away.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.080]   Doesn't go away?
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.720]   And it comes up-- it'll say, it comes up
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.240]   as like there's an update for-- what I had was an updated
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:51.240]   version of iTunes was available.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.640]   So then when I click, it says, would you like to upgrade?
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.160]   And then it-- or it pops up the whole--
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.960]   it's the Apple updater software.
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.640]   So there was check boxes.
[00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.760]   So there are check boxes.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.320]   And this is what I had to read up in arms.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.360]   The check box for iTunes QuickTime was selected,
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.880]   and the check box for Safari was selected,
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.240]   as though it were an update to existing software.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.800]   Back it was a whole new installation.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.040]   You're in an unusual situation, though,
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.040]   because that iTunes update came out a few weeks before then.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.600]   I think people--
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.160]   Others may--
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.640]   --said that the updater popped up for them like that
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.200]   with only Safari in it.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:19.840]   Yes.
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.360]   Because I had updated iTunes when that update was first
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.160]   pushed.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.280]   That was pretty Safari.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.960]   So I got the updater that just said Safari.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.600]   But I didn't have--
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.120]   Well, it's interesting.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.240]   I didn't have Safari on Windows.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.000]   I don't use Safari on Windows.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.480]   Exactly.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.280]   And it kept bugging me.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:32.960]   He finally did.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.720]   I said, all right, fine.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.320]   That was really nice of you.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.480]   I took a different approach.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.000]   I wasn't that happy.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:41.760]   I wasn't that happy.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.160]   Any event-- I did read the Yula, and it said, you may not.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.600]   You may not install this on Windows.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.640]   So it's interesting.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.320]   There's a good article on ours, Technica,
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.680]   by David Chartier, who is a Twitter fella, on Yuliz.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.000]   And companies not reading their own darn Yuliz.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.520]   Adobe Photoshop Express had a little Yula problem
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.720]   earlier this week.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.160]   By the way, have you used Express yet?
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.320]   No, I haven't used it.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.520]   Oh, Photoshop.com/Express.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.400]   It's Adobe.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400]   It's kind of-- the idea is it's Flickr,
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.360]   but it's got built-in.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.200]   It must be an air.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.000]   It's beautiful.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.800]   It's got built-in photo manipulation stuff,
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.680]   but it's also gallery.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.280]   Very slick will import your photos from Photo Bucket
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.200]   Facebook-- not Flickr.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.800]   Photo Bucket Facebook and Zoomer.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.040]   I can't remember another site.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.080]   Just gorgeous.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:38.600]   But in the Yula, it says, the content that you add to it,
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.280]   you grant Adobe a worldwide royalty-free, non-exclusive,
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.320]   perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable license
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.320]   to use, distribute, derive revenue, or other renumeration
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.440]   from, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly,
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.280]   perform, and publicly display such content,
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   and to incorporate such content into other materials
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.640]   or works in any form or medium, now known or later developed.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.160]   In other words--
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.800]   So they're saying they own you pictures.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.560]   We poned you, baby.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.080]   They're not saying-- it's interesting,
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.280]   because they don't say they own them.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.400]   They don't say they own them.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.280]   It makes it-- right, it makes it explicit that you still own them,
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.800]   but that they can use it however they want.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.480]   So in the future, it's not exclusive.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.440]   It's not exclusive license.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.040]   Well, you say they're indemnifying,
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.680]   but others say, well, they could also take my picture of a 10-year-old
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.400]   and put it on the box of Adobe Photoshop,
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.200]   and they wouldn't have to ask me.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.520]   Right.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:26.880]   Anyway--
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.520]   Which interestingly, this is very--
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.360]   I mean, I was kind of surprised that this turned into such
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   a big deal, because this is a very standard Yula language
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.520]   for media uploading.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.400]   Yeah, Facebook has similar.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:34.920]   That they make.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.840]   Yeah, Flickr has similar.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:37.840]   They changed it.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.840]   They changed it.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.080]   They did.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.640]   They backed down.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.440]   The blogosphere wins again.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.920]   So what did they change it to?
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.560]   Adobe says, we heard your concerns about the terms of service.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.120]   We reviewed the terms in context of your comments.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120]   We agree.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.120]   It implies things we would never do.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:54.800]   So they're making--
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.920]   I think they haven't changed it yet.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.120]   No, they're going to revive--
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.640]   the legal team is hard at work.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.480]   Like our secretary of the treasury,
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.680]   they're probably working over the weekend.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.720]   I kid you not.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.880]   OK, we're in trouble now.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.600]   They're working on the weekend.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.640]   Anyway, so I think we should make a hall of fame
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.440]   for bizarre Yulas.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.160]   Anyway, thank you, David, for that good article.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.240]   It's again pointing that out.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.960]   I'll tell you.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.320]   That's funny.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.440]   I got an email from John C. de Vorek saying,
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.120]   I can't be on the show, but you could send me a check.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.200]   So I'm going to send John money for not being on the show.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.120]   If anybody would like money for not being on the show, email me.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:42.840]   And I'll be glad to ignore that email later in the day.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.760]   Fellas, and gals, anything else you'd like to talk about?
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.200]   Al Jashi of the Mad Magazine Profile of New York Times.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.240]   Did you see that?
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.320]   The guy who does the fold-ins?
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.640]   Now there's a media that may never die.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.760]   Now I haven't seen Mad Magazine in years.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.280]   So great.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.440]   I mean, it's that spy burst, spy stuff going on.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.520]   Yeah, it's still there, yeah.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.520]   But that's a different artist.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.680]   The cool thing about Al Jashi is that he's been--
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.520]   he has done over 400 of these fold-ins.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.440]   He's 87 years old.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.680]   And the article had some cool information.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.720]   Like, he does the entire thing on hard board
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.440]   so that he himself doesn't really--
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.440]   he's not able to experiment with the fold-in.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.800]   I don't understand how he does it.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.400]   He said he could-- well, he probably
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.360]   uses tracing paper and things like that to check it out.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.320]   But he said he knows it would be much easier
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.280]   to do on the computer.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:38.520]   But age 87, cut him a little slack.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.280]   Who cares?
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.160]   I love him.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.440]   He's great.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.400]   He's fantastic.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.560]   The article was just great.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.160]   They said he was such a gentleman.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.840]   And he was going through a cancer scare during the whole thing.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.880]   And a friend emailed that to me.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:59.560]   Yeah, and so it's just a good example of the many sources
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.000]   where I get my news.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.480]   There's email and RSS.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:08.240]   And it just all comes together to be this great self-made newspaper.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.320]   Well, I got it from Boeing-Wine.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.800]   So there.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.160]   Great.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.120]   I will say also, I have never read Politico.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.760]   And then since Steve was talking about it,
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.400]   I've been kind of possibly perusing in the background here.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.120]   And that's pretty great.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.320]   Yeah, it's a good site.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.000]   It looks like they have paid journalists on staff, too.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.120]   I was looking at the About Us link.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.880]   No, they run it like a business.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.440]   What a concept.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.280]   Amazing.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.640]   Whoa.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.720]   These kids today.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.200]   I'll tell you.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.560]   No, we do a-- I do another podcast on this network
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.800]   with Dick D. Bartolo, who is another one of the usual gang
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.640]   of idiots from Mad Magazine.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.840]   Well, yeah, that's cool.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.640]   That's great.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.040]   And I tell you, I took a tour of Mad
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.120]   and saw some of the original Al Jaffi stuff.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.080]   And Dick loves Al.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.080]   Al really is courtly.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.240]   He's really a neat guy.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.320]   Mad Magazine is an example of old media I never want to go away.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.000]   And by the way, they put it out on DVD, every copy of Mad.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.800]   It's not the same.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.640]   It isn't the same.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.480]   Not the same.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.240]   You want it.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.680]   Especially that early stuff that Will Elder and Harvey
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.520]   Kurtzman did where the minutiae and the tiny little--
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.240]   That was a little marginal.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.120]   Chicken fat as Elder calls it.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.120]   You can't-- the PDFs are-- the scans aren't good enough
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.120]   to check that stuff out.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.920]   And you get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   He's a writer.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.440]   Although they'd have an automatic fold-in capability.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.240]   So it does save you the time of doing the fold-ins.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.320]   Anyway, hey, it's really been great talking to you all.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.200]   I just-- what a pleasure and fascinating conversation.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.640]   Mark Fronfelter is, I have now learned editor-in-chief
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.880]   of Mad Magazine.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.600]   I'm such an idiot.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.000]   And of course, one of the founders
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.760]   of Boing Boing a directory of wonderful things
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.960]   at boingboing.net.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.240]   The Maker Fair coming up May 3rd and 4th at San Mateo.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.120]   Are you going to have-- is Ignatian going to be there again
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.040]   this year?
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:49.880]   No, I'm sure they will.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.800]   They've been there every year so far.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.040]   Yeah, revision three covers it.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.400]   And I just asked before the show of Mark
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.360]   if I could do my radio show the next year.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.400]   So maybe we'll do it that way.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:06:59.960]   Let's do it.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:00.880]   That'd love to be--
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.680]   So does that mean Fox News is going to be there?
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.800]   Yeah, Fox News will be covering Maker Fair with Ignatian.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.920]   Awesome.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.560]   Great story.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:07.600]   I'm actually--
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.280]   I'm twittering that right now, actually.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.160]   Heard on the street.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.880]   Maker Fair, if they want to get tickets,
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:20.360]   go to makerfair.com and it's f-a-i-r-e.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.560]   at makerfair.com.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.640]   And that's going to be a lot of fun May 3rd and 4th
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.560]   in San Mateo.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.560]   Thank you for being here, Mark.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.520]   Really appreciate it.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.320]   Y'all, thank you.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:33.640]   Molly Wood is, of course, on CNET's buzz out loud B-o-l.cnet.com
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:38.000]   and cnettv.com, where she is reinventing the media
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.960]   despite her J school background.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.960]   Doing a great job, too.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.400]   I'm nothing if not a mercenary.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.640]   We forgive you the degree.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.200]   It's OK.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.240]   Speaking as a college dropout, it's OK.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.120]   You don't have to drop out, Molly.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.200]   She's proving it.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.600]   And of course, the great Steve Gilmore.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.360]   Great to have you on.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.200]   Well, I really appreciate you being so kind to have me back.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:02.720]   Oh, please.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.320]   Give me a break.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.600]   Newsgang.net.
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.480]   Is that the best place to send people?
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.440]   Absolutely.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:11.040]   And Dave Slusher is the evil genius.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.080]   And he's showing up on the news gang these days, too,
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.000]   which is very cool.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.360]   Evil genius, chronicles.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.920]   It's his Google address.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.600]   Yeah, his cranky Google address.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.840]   He's a proto-podcaster.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.400]   Yeah, I mean, he just doesn't get any more serious than him.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.440]   Defy the zeitgeist.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.680]   We thank you for joining us once again.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.600]   A reminder, I will not be here next week of the week after.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.680]   I think there will be no Twitter,
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.120]   although there have been moves of foot to do
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.840]   Twitter without me, so it's possible they'll be shows.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.320]   Just keep your feed open.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.840]   I don't know why anybody would close their feed.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.800]   But keep your feed open.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.960]   There will be other shows on the network,
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.360]   including Steve Gibson's doing security now.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.520]   Every Thursday, he's not going to miss a beat.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.560]   We got daily giz wass every day.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.160]   We're going to have, I believe, Mac Break Weeklies as well.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.960]   And follow my Australian adventures online at leoville.com.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.200]   I'll be putting up pictures, video and blogging as well.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:06.960]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.520]   Another tweet.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.720]   This is amazing.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.440]   Is in the can.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:22.720]   That's a good example of a friend email that to me,
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.240]   that article, something that I wouldn't find on my own.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.840]   Steve, are you through now?
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:31.800]   Are you calling for a pizza?
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.640]   What's going on?
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.360]   Oh, my teenager is about to get--
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.520]   Oh, oh, he's mad.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.560]   Oh, no, dad.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.440]   Get off the phone.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.240]   I'm trying to get a pizza here.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.480]   I'm relaxed, so here's the deal.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.720]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.240]   but I have a hell of a ton of blue screens.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.480]   Like, forget it.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.480]   I'm killing you.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.480]   [LAUGHING]
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480]   Round the morning.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.480]   Do it on the Twitter.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.480]   All right.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.480]   Do it on the Twitter, baby.
