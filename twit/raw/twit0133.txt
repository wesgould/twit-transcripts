[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.540]   Ladies and gentlemen, what a great Twit we've got today.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.040]   And we will do a little bit of news, but really,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.440]   it's such a rare opportunity to talk about how the Internet
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.940]   is reshaping artistry, creation.
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.580]   I want to talk about that too.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.280]   But let me tell you who we have here.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.520]   We're really thrilled to have Jonathan Colton with us.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.320]   The guy who wrote the, so many great songs, Code Monkey,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.360]   of course many of you have heard on our shows many times.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.960]   He just wrote, we're recently, wrote Still Alive for Portal,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.100]   which is the closing theme in Portal.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.600]   And Jonathan, it's great to have you from New York.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800]   Well, it's great to be here.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.500]   Big fans.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.000]   Now, the truth is we're getting the band back together.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.140]   We played once.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.400]   There were some rumors that we had broken up, but that's not true.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.040]   It's not true.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   With us also, Merlin Mann on drums.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.540]   Hello there.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.980]   From 43 folders.
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.820]   On lead guitar from, I don't know, from Leeds, England,
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.780]   Veronica Belmont.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.120]   Hello.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.120]   From mahalo.com.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.520]   And I played the bass.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.320]   We'll talk about what we're talking about in just a second.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.320]   Also with us are groupies.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.820]   Ryan Block, chief editor and chief at Engadget.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.820]   I'm a groupie.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.820]   Yes, hello.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.820]   And Tom Merritt.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.820]   Yes, Ryan and I were watching at least.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.820]   For Buzz Out Lab.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.460]   You were in the audience at this amazing concert that we did on
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.140]   Saturday night at the Great American Music Hall.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.940]   I don't understand it.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.140]   I don't hate Karen San Francisco at all.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.820]   I love San Francisco.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.740]   It's always so much fun.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.340]   I mean, you saw the crowd there.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.340]   They were crazy.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.780]   Now, you were making your DVD.
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.620]   Were they by invite or how did that work out?
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.220]   No, those are all ticket buyers.
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.420]   And the reason I ask is because it felt like it was all your
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.420]   buddies.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.420]   I know.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.420]   Well, that's why I love San Francisco.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.260]   San Francisco is one of the cities where when I do a show,
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.100]   that's how it feels.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.260]   It's the craziest thing.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.100]   And we'll talk about this a little bit later on in the show,
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.020]   but I want to kind of address this whole notion of the niche.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.820]   Because I mean, I'm a niche broadcaster for sure.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.020]   And in a way, I think you're a niche musician.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.500]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   And I want to know if that's your choice or not, but we'll talk
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   about that in a second.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.660]   And I even have a video.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.660]   Yes, go ahead Veronica.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.140]   I can't hear Jonathan at all.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.140]   Oh, of course not.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.140]   I can't hear my there.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.820]   I haven't done the magic of turning him up.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.980]   Thanks to the magic of--
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.340]   See, Veronica, study this in college.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.540]   Veronica, why aren't you running the board?
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.060]   I don't know.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.620]   You should hire me to do it sometime.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.820]   I can't afford you.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.820]   You're getting Calicanis rates now.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.580]   You're priced out of my market.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.660]   Easy.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.020]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.100]   And there are a couple of things I
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.420]   want to mention in the news, real quickly, before we go.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.220]   These are-- they really weren't a whole lot of stories.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.220]   This is a good time to talk about our rock success.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.580]   But before we do that, I shouldn't mention a couple of things.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.340]   I asked Ryan Block.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.100]   He said the big story.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.980]   Of course, HD DVD.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.340]   Finally, really kicking the bucket.
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.580]   This is a story I've been saying every week.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.980]   As we watched the dominoes fall, since it started at the beginning
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.380]   of the year with Warner Brothers deciding not to make HD DVDs anymore.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.780]   Finally, exactly a week ago, Toshiba said, that's it.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.260]   We're giving up.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.980]   Microsoft this week said, OK, we're
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.340]   giving up to no more HD DVD and Xbox 360.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.220]   So it's over.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.060]   Ryan, finally.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.580]   Finally.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.420]   After years.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.780]   So I don't know why you feel really relieved.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.100]   I do really care who won between Blu-ray and HD DVD.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.340]   So much is that one format came to the top and the other went away.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.260]   And--
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.700]   You were just tired of seeing HD DVD on its deathbed since January.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.180]   It was hooked up to the IV, the catheters, the heart monitors.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.580]   I mean, I got a really bad feeling for them
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.900]   when they basically packed up and went home at CES.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.500]   Because the Warner announcement came right before CES.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.820]   And their response to that was, we're
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.140]   going to cancel our press conference.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.940]   Wasn't that what you knew?
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.980]   Was that what you knew was over?
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.980]   The worst possible thing you could do.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.140]   I think we talked about it at the time.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.500]   And I think that's when you knew it was over, right?
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.100]   I had a feeling that they would actually
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.060]   try to draw it out longer than they did.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.780]   If I was going to just estimate at the time,
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.700]   I would have said, I might have gone through the second half
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.300]   of the year.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   So I'm a little relieved that they decided to just kind of cut
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.660]   it short and cut their losses and let everybody move on.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.700]   I saw a story today that said maybe Sony had actually
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.060]   laid out some cash for that.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.460]   You think that's--
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.780]   Yeah, I saw a rumor 400 million or something
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.020]   got paid to Toshiba to back up.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.900]   No, the rumor was 400 million paid to Warner
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.820]   to go exclusive.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.220]   That I did lose.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.980]   And the corollary rumor to that was that Sony paid something
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.060]   like 800, 900 million to Toshiba in changing hands of an RSX
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.620]   to the cell chip plant.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.900]   And the cell chip is what powers a lot of--
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.420]   it's what powers the PlayStation 3
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.980]   and also powers a lot of HD DVD players.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.460]   Really, there's cell chips and HD DVD players?
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.940]   I didn't know that.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.500]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.380]   Yeah, so I mean, I think that there's
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.340]   a lot of talk about moneyed interests.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.260]   I mean, I don't think that that was probably
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.500]   what decided for Toshiba.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   I mean, they just--
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.020]   the day they couldn't hack it.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.820]   They didn't have the ties and the entertainment industry
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.420]   that Sony did.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.620]   I mean, nobody really thought about it as much years back
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.980]   when the format was starting.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.020]   But Sony just has an almost limitless amount of cash
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.540]   that they can throw at entertainment entities.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.100]   And the Toshiba never had that.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.820]   No, Toshiba can never offer $400 million to Warner.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.100]   I have to congratulate Sony.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.140]   Sony did this with guts.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.140]   They said, we're going to put this thing in this Blu-ray
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.820]   player in the PS3, even though it's going to cost us a lot more.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.220]   It's going to hold up our launch.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.220]   It's going to slow the production.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.820]   It turns out it paid off for them.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.660]   It was a gamble, though.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.180]   It's fake.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.820]   I mean, if Sony had had the entertainment ties back
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.820]   during Betamax, do you think that Beto would have won?
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.580]   It's possible.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.860]   I mean, Beto was this a pair of format.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.340]   I thought that he was Sony's.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.380]   Wasn't that their format?
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.380]   Yeah, that's what I mean.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.980]   But Sony didn't have all of these entertainment ties back
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.980]   in the late '70s, early '80s that they have now.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.500]   Why?
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.180]   I see what you're saying.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.020]   Yeah, they didn't have the movie studio.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.220]   All right, that's one story.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.260]   We could say goodbye to HD DVD with great relief.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.780]   It's fine.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.620]   It's over.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.140]   I have two--
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.180]   Can we play taps?
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.060]   I actually had something last week.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.460]   I played Chopin's funeral march.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.180]   All right.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.700]   I could still play it again, but it's a downer.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.420]   I'm going to put my little HD DVD add-on player right up
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.580]   next to the Timex Sinclair.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.260]   I have two HD DVD players.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.340]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.260]   And like 20 movies.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.740]   I don't know what I'm--
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.980]   They're still good for upconverting?
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.460]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.580]   My TV does that just fine.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.260]   The door stop?
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.740]   Yeah, that's mostly it.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.620]   You're just being polite.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.460]   I'm being polite.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.460]   I was mad at all.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.460]   I was mad at all.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.580]   It's the top 10 things to do with your HD DVD player.
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.420]   Oh, that was a great list.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.100]   I saw that too.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.620]   And gadget.com, you tell us a couple of them.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.460]   All right, well, you know, why don't you give me
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.700]   just a sex I can pull that up?
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.660]   Also in the news in Berlin, man brought this up.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.860]   And then we're going to get to Joko.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.620]   I'm sorry, Jonathan, to bore you with all this.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.860]   Although, Jonathan, you were used to be a computer programmer.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.860]   This is not--
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.380]   No, this is not boring at all to me.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.220]   I-- I love this stuff.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.980]   You're a geek.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.140]   I just don't feel smart enough to talk.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.900]   Oh, Merlin had that problem for a while.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.060]   That doesn't stop any of us.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.060]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.780]   OK, now that I drop a couple things to do with your HD DVD player.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.780]   All right.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.780]   So one thing you might be able to do, number five on the list,
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.340]   is channel it through Whoopi Goldberg
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.380]   and make some pottery with it.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.380]   A lot of readers--
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.380]   A little ghost reference.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:22.860]   I got it.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:22.860]   I got it.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.420]   They're too young for that reference, though.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.660]   A lot of the readers--
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.260]   And I'm good at it.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.580]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.420]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.260]   Veronica, are you two young for that reference?
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:29.760]   No.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.140]   Well, then who the hell is too young for that reference?
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.860]   Like the 13-year-olds that are reading and gadget these days.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.660]   There's a five-year old--
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.180]   Well, the Dewey defeats Truman reference.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.220]   I understood some people being too young for it.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.220]   It was also--
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.620]   A lot of people get that.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.740]   I photoshopped HD DVD defeats Blu-ray on the day
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.900]   of the death of HD DVD.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.460]   And so many people were confused.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.460]   What are you talking about?
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.460]   Did you have Harry Truman--
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:51.980]   You had Harry Truman--
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.820]   No, no, no, no.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.740]   Yeah, the Harry Schumer was the Congressman.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.260]   Oh, no.
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.220]   That's so funny.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.940]   History 101, anybody.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.380]   I like buy a few dozen HD DVD players
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.780]   and build a hut for your Blu-ray player.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.500]   A little bit of a little tent.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.300]   Yes, exactly.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.340]   You've got to keep it safe.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.220]   I can't believe that Thomas Edison
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.340]   electrocuted an elephant to try and improve that HD DVD was
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.140]   better.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.380]   That just doesn't seem appropriate.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.860]   See now, just because you don't like Tesla,
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.460]   you don't need to go out and electrocuted an elephant.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:25.900]   That's not right.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.740]   Youngsters.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.260]   That one only--
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.540]   The 80-year-olds in the audience are getting that one,
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.040]   Merlin.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.980]   I don't know where you come up with this stuff.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.740]   Are you channeling--
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.340]   This will be the last one.
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.740]   This is actually the one I think a lot of people
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.020]   are probably going to try to do.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.460]   And I might even get trouble for it.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.700]   And that is, buy the Blu-ray player of your choice.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.660]   Put it in a box.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.340]   Attempt to return it as, quote unquote, "defective."
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.220]   You mean HD DVD player?
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:45.620]   No, no, no.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.860]   You buy a Blu-ray player.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.500]   Return it with the HD DVD player.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.300]   It's a box.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:50.660]   It's a box.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.140]   It's defective.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.340]   There's something wrong with this.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.220]   It won't play.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.260]   It might work.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.140]   There's something wrong with it.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.420]   It's a dead format.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.580]   Look at it.
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.380]   It smells it.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:01.820]   Is it the wrong?
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.260]   I spent all this money on this player.
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.020]   And now it's OK.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.380]   You got me.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.340]   And then Merlin wanted to bring up the kind of interesting
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.940]   article about Ed Felton, who is a great security researcher
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:17.500]   and has done a lot on this, pointed out and observed
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.420]   that I didn't know this.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.380]   Ram doesn't lose its memory immediately.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.340]   That even after you've powered down the system,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.660]   the Ram, it retains the contents for some undetermined
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.580]   period of time.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.420]   He further-- I'm sure I could just
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.740]   see the graduate students working on this one.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.180]   He further found out that if you freeze the Ram
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.900]   using compressed air or something like that,
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.460]   you actually have the time to take it out of the old system,
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.460]   put it in a new system, and read its contents.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.780]   And of course, if you've had an encrypted hard drive using
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.620]   true crypt or PGP disk or a lot of different full disk
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.020]   encryption technologies, including Microsoft's BitLocker
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.380]   and File Vault, which is Apple's OS X encryption,
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.260]   that the keys are kept in Ram.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.820]   So if you can get the Ram, put it in a new computer, read the Ram,
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.860]   you'll get the key, and you can unlock the drive.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.260]   Pointing out that, in other words, this encryption stuff
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.620]   isn't going to be--
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.980]   is hackable.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.020]   But I have to point out, you also have to somehow get the laptop
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.900]   away from the guy after he logs in, but before he logs out,
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.900]   before it goes back to sleep, you have to take it over
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.540]   to your secret layer, spray it with a freeon, pull it out,
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.140]   put it in another laptop, read it, put it back in,
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.140]   give the guy the laptop back.
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.940]   So it's not an easy hack.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.460]   Totally.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.100]   The reason I thought I was trying to handle a little complicated
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.340]   than it probably is.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.860]   And the fact is, drive encryption techniques
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.740]   are there to prevent people from reading it
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.020]   if they have physical access to the machine.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.780]   But it won't work unless you've logged in to the machine.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.140]   In other words, you have to unlock the drive
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.620]   before this technical work.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.020]   The key--
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.420]   No, it's just all you have to do is on the machine.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.940]   No, well, the key isn't in Ram until you give it the password,
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.940]   though, yes?
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.300]   No, the key is in Ram as soon as you turn on the machine.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   Oh.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.220]   Is that right?
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.460]   Huh, I didn't realize that.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.620]   That was what they stated in an exploit video.
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.540]   Merlin, Merlin.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.940]   Well, I heard all these horror stories in the last year or two
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.780]   about in the UK, in the US, all these laptops disappearing.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.460]   And I think the panacea people said, well,
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.540]   that's just because you hadn't locked your disk down.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.740]   And so I just wonder, I mean, if there--
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.460]   so is it fair to say that this had been kind of the way
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.180]   that high security folks were depending on their stuff
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.860]   to be encrypted?
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.140]   I mean, it just seems like-- I don't know.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.740]   If you've got it in your possession--
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.820]   Well, yes and no.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.260]   I mean, I think the way--
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.900]   if you're talking about CIA kind of operatives,
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.460]   like if you're imagining that scenario,
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.940]   what you're going to be really looking at
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.060]   is a totally locked down laptop.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.340]   But that laptop is going to phone home.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.900]   And all the data is going to live in Langley.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.180]   Right?
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.380]   I mean, it's not going to live on that laptop.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.380]   You're not going to have top secret documents or something
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:49.900]   like that.
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.980]   What about like, what about like, really extreme scenarios?
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.620]   What about like, if you-- like, a lot of people I know--
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.940]   and I'm trying to get in this habit-- is, so I want to Mac--
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.700]   a lot of people I know are creating like sparse images
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:04.300]   or making super encrypted disk images inside the actual disk.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.780]   Does this hack affect that as well?
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.060]   I don't think so.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.900]   I don't think that it would.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.780]   Not unless you happen to be-- you happen to have that drive
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.100]   open at the time.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.380]   So if people are with it--
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.220]   The concept of this hack.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.100]   Why wouldn't that key also be in the RAM at good time, though?
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.740]   Because you haven't opened up that disk.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.740]   If you're creating a virtual disk or a disk image or something
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.220]   that if you haven't actually opened it yet,
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.180]   then you wouldn't have to have loaded that key into memory.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.980]   So the concept of this hack is you turn on your computer,
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.660]   you basically let it boot to your login prompt,
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.020]   and that key is in memory.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.020]   And then--
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.820]   It is--
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.980]   That's the question.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.100]   If it is in memory yet or not, I mean,
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.060]   if you're using a BIOS encryption technique or a true crypt,
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.780]   for instance, maybe there's a key there,
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.460]   but you don't unlock until you enter the password.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.860]   It doesn't automatically unlock.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.460]   And if it does, then you have a flaw.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.140]   If you're talking about drive encryption,
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.300]   and usually these refer to whole drive encryption techniques,
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.220]   as far as I know, which is the entire drive,
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.700]   it's not like I'm going to encrypt this folder or that folder.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.620]   It's the entire drive isn't encrypted,
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.780]   which would mean that the second you turn on that computer,
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.940]   it has to go find the key so it can actually
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.580]   start the boot process.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:16.940]   So--
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.140]   No, no.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.060]   It asks you for a password, though, at that point.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.860]   Look, if the drive automatically boots up and logs in
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.940]   without your password, they don't need any of this.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.140]   Right?
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.540]   It has to ask you for the password, otherwise they don't--
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.660]   then you're not secure anyway.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.660]   Well, only assuming you could bypass the initial login.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.020]   Right.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.940]   Anyway, we'll look more into this.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.060]   I think it's an interesting story.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.460]   I think it's a little difficult to do.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.380]   Should we ask Jonathan, what's your password?
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:49.060]   You know, you laugh, but it's funny because--
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.780]   Just freeze his brain and extract that.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.380]   I asked the secret service this.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.300]   I've talked to the FBI in Secret Service about this.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.060]   What are you going to do when encryption is common
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.660]   and bad guys use encryption?
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.140]   They say, oh, they use it all the time.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.060]   We ask them for the password.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.180]   They almost always just give it to us.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:03.980]   Wow.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.540]   That's what Kevin Mitnick says.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.500]   It's ultimately the best way to get access is to call--
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:08.860]   Stas.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.940]   Call it a C-level and ask him what his password is.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.780]   Right there.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.620]   Well, MIT.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.780]   Yeah, apparently crooks are so anxious to confess
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.220]   they don't either that or they're waterboarding.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.300]   They may not have mentioned that part.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.380]   They might have said waterboarding and then ask.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.100]   With this water-- with this freezing hack,
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.340]   I was thinking, well, what you've got to do
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.420]   is just stand by your laptop for 35 seconds or so.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.820]   Because that's about the longest that your key will stay in ram
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.180]   before it fades away.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.820]   But if it's their boot up, I guess that blows that out of the water.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.900]   Anyway, three interesting stories.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.180]   We have one that I is breaking right now,
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.580]   and I don't have the details on, but I'm going to--
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.100]   possibly, at the end of this show,
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.460]   we'll add an interview with a network security expert
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.020]   about this because I'm trying to track it down.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.620]   Earlier today, YouTube was down for about 45 minutes
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.300]   to an hour.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.340]   I mean, really down.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.460]   No message saying our servers are down,
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.300]   or we're fixing the servers.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.380]   Nothing.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.220]   You know, the only thing I have to say about that,
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.420]   that's kind of frightening, is that the whole time YouTube
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.100]   was down, those commenters were somewhere else.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.700]   Where were they?
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.620]   And what were they doing?
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.500]   Where did they go?
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.420]   That's what I wanted to do.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.580]   Quickly, go to your blog.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.100]   Check your comments.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.980]   Well, there's a larger story here,
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.620]   and this is what I need a network expert to explain to me.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.780]   And we are going to look into this.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.180]   And it's funny how the tech press really
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.420]   has gone home for the weekend.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.220]   So there's very little about this on the internet today.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.980]   Tomorrow, I imagine you'll see a lot.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.060]   You might have seen a story that said Pakistan
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.580]   was going to block YouTube because of anti-Islamic videos
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.140]   on YouTube.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.980]   That story broke yesterday.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.460]   Apparently, and I've been reading some posts
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.100]   from network operators and so forth.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.340]   And I'll give you links on the show notes
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.100]   so you can read these for yourself.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.620]   When Pakistan blocked it, they made
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.940]   some round-- simple router errors, routing errors,
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.740]   that propagated throughout the rest of the net,
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.780]   and actually did bring YouTube down globally
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.740]   because of what Pakistan did.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.580]   Wow.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.820]   Currently, YouTube is being routed.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.780]   As far as I can tell, it was a trace route through Hong Kong.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.300]   So I think there's more to this than meets the eye.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.660]   There will be, of course, a lot of speculation
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.340]   that Pakistan do this on purpose.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.980]   YouTube was able to respond quickly.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.700]   They got it back, not universally,
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.700]   but they started coming back about 45 minutes after.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.180]   I was doing the radio show at the time,
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.180]   and I have chatroom users from all over the world.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.980]   So I was seeing reports as it kind of slowly
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.180]   came back around the world.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.740]   As far as I know, it's up everywhere now.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.500]   But I think a very interesting story.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.580]   So there'll be more to talk about-- perhaps
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.500]   at the end of this show, if I can get some network experts
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.420]   on, we'll talk about that.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.820]   But that could be serious.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.500]   I mean, that could be a significant issue going down
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.780]   the road if it's possible to do that.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.980]   Meanwhile, let's get back to the most important story
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.740]   of the day, and that's the fact that we rocked 99% on Saturday
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.780]   night.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.180]   We were 99% perfect.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.700]   Now, you were very gracious, Jonathan, and he said that was OK.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.700]   It's an A-plus.
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.700]   It's an A-plus, yeah.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.820]   99 is an A-plus.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:11.100]   Well, according to the YouTube commenters--
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.100]   Some of the YouTube--
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.100]   Yeah, I'll just say that anyway.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.340]   --that's a very pointed remarks about our performance.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.540]   Like, I haven't read anything yet, but I know.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.500]   And I want to take full blame.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.620]   I cannot play the bass.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.180]   We knew that going in.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.020]   You were very upfront about that, Leah.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.780]   She had a hat.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.740]   You had a hat, and you had a really cool shirt.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.860]   I had the best costume.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.660]   I don't think anybody-- although, well, OK,
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.700]   well, I had the best costume.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.260]   Jonathan had the best pecs.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.420]   Look, Rick, didn't he look cot?
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.860]   He looks like he's been doing sit-ups or something.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.900]   Where'd you get that shirt, Jonathan?
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.900]   I want one of those.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.500]   That shirt?
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.060]   I don't know.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.940]   It's just the plain cot and shirt.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.460]   I'm not style-conscious like you, Leo.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.780]   Well, then I'm going to say he's cut.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.940]   No, I've just maybe a little small for me with the problem.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.700]   Also, as I said, I was holding my stomach in the whole time.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.500]   Well, we've got Vimeo video of the thing.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.460]   I'm sure there'll be more video, but we've got Vimeo video
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.060]   thanks to Chris at Joystick, who was in the audience
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.740]   with an HD-- a Canon X-Acte HD 1000.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.380]   He's your camera guy, I guess, Victoria.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.940]   You just called me Victoria.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.100]   Good Lord, Veronica.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.540]   Er, Kanye.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.420]   Victoria, Vrecon, whatever happened to her?
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.580]   Inside edition.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:16.860]   Really?
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.820]   Is that where she is now?
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.340]   Yep.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:18.860]   Yep.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.340]   She was the--
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.340]   It was the question I was reading the YouTube comments.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:21.980]   Oh, dear.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.140]   Are they that bad?
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.980]   Oh, not that bad.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.940]   Massive fail.
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.380]   Massive fail.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.780]   Well, these are kids who play rock band Day in Day Out.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.300]   I'd never played rock band before.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:30.780]   But we should--
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.100]   You should have pulled a stu-suck cliff
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.540]   and just had an unplugged bass while somebody else actually
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.300]   was playing the line.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.220]   I was on heroin.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.420]   Does that help?
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:37.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.780]   That's Apple there.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.220]   Always with the heroin, Leo.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.380]   Jonathan, I'm sorry.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.300]   I'm an addict.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.540]   Jonathan, you want to explain what happened?
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.900]   What was going on there?
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.540]   Well, I was in San Francisco playing a show
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.580]   that I was also shooting in the hopes
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.660]   that I will release it as a concert DVD or something
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.820]   like that sometime in the future.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.380]   And I wanted something fancy and exciting.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.140]   And when they let me know that that song was coming out
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.860]   on rock band, I said, well, I know what would be exciting.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.380]   So I asked the people of harmonics
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.980]   if they could help out in getting a special developers Xbox
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.740]   there, which is the only thing that can run still alive
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.140]   because it's not officially released yet.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.820]   And they were very helpful in getting everything set up.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:30.100]   And then I wanted to invite a bunch of local famous people.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.820]   But they couldn't make it, so I asked you guys.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.940]   You got the geeks, that's for sure.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.380]   I did.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.620]   Well, that's exactly what I wanted.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.780]   I wanted a band of famous geeks playing a video game
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.980]   in a place where people had paid money to see entertainment.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.940]   I thought that would be funny.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.740]   And I do think that even though we got the 99%,
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.060]   I think the spectacle of it was worth something
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.100]   to the people in that audience.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.700]   They seem to really appreciate it.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.180]   They loved it.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.460]   They gave us a standing ovation, which shocked me.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.140]   My wife said it was the best part of the show.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.380]   She was her favorite part.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.620]   Your mother said that?
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.300]   Oh, my wife.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.060]   Oh, sorry.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.580]   I'm misused to it.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.980]   That's not my--
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.780]   I'm sure you'll get to this, but it must be noted
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.700]   that despite everything that Leo and I could do to ruin the show,
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.900]   it's Victoria, right?
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:22.900]   Veronica stuff stuff.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.580]   Why, Ayada.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.500]   Why, Ayada.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.420]   Veronica, man, she threw down.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.940]   She was throwing down some Inge style legs as the LMS
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.180]   thumpled around.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.420]   You guys would sort of lose power completely,
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.820]   fall out of the game.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.340]   And she would pull that move and save you
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.540]   and bring you back into the game.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.420]   It was fantastic.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.300]   She was like-- she was the only one
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.580]   keeping it together, really.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.500]   Oh, thank you, you guys.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.740]   We call her Veronica Overdrive Belmont.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.620]   Ooh, I like that.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.460]   I'm OK with that.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.180]   That's pretty good.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.380]   Yeah, I mean, if we had more time of practice,
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.620]   I think we would have totally blown it out of the park.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.740]   But we did very well for ourselves, all things considered.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.900]   We got one.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.140]   We got to go through it once.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.340]   Ahead of time.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.740]   Yeah, which is nothing.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.580]   Because that is a complicated song.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.540]   Oh, please.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.300]   The bass line begins a minute in.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.740]   I failed a minute 30 in.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.260]   It's no, it's a grass and pocket.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.260]   But, you know--
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.500]   I have to say my favorite thing is that because 99% is very
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.500]   close to 100.
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.900]   I don't think I have to tell you that.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.780]   But we were sort of teetering on the brink of disaster
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.420]   for most of the song.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.700]   And I didn't think we were going to get to the end.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.980]   And then, of course, we did get to the end.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.460]   We appeared to finish the song.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.700]   We started high-fiving each other.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.260]   And then I turned around.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.260]   And I noticed that that song failed.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.180]   So not only did we fail, but we high-fived each other as we
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.060]   were playing it.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.660]   I just want to point out that I failed right at the
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.740]   chorus at the final chorus at the end where you're saying,
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.500]   I'm still alive.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.020]   And I thought that was very fitting.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.660]   You have a perfect thing about it.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.620]   Actually, no, you're not.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.460]   I'm dead.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.780]   And by the way, the cake is a lie.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.700]   I just want everybody.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.660]   I have to say, OK, now let's back up a little bit, talk a
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.700]   little bit about the twit part of this, which is what Jonathan
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.260]   is doing is absolutely fascinating as a business model.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.180]   And it became really clear to me going to that concert.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:22.620]   You have, willingly or not, eschewed universal stardom in
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.540]   favor of just going right for the niche.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:32.260]   I'm not sure that was the choice, necessarily.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.700]   I feel like the niche found me.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.540]   From my perspective, I just do what I like to do.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.740]   And then it just happens to be that it's really geeky stuff.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.060]   It's interesting to see this audience.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.220]   And they come bearing creepy dolls.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.180]   They come bearing monkeys and ponies.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.060]   And they come as zombies.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.500]   There was a guy dressed as a zombie with a badge that
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.380]   says, hi, my name is Bob.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.380]   I mean, they're so into your music.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.020]   And you rarely see this.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.540]   I think in some ways you are genuinely an internet--
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.140]   one of the first internet superstars, in the sense that
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.740]   you get the kind of response from a very particular group of
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.100]   people that any artist would want to get.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:21.940]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.060]   But you're just on a small scale.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.300]   But well, I don't know how small it is, because as
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.140]   somebody who programs to the same niche, that's not a bad
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.220]   niche.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.340]   Oh, no, not at all.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.020]   I mean, compared to--
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.420]   I think that you would probably see the same number of
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.660]   people in the equivalent of costume and in the equivalent
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.940]   of carrying half-on-half monkey monsters if you went to an
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.780]   Aerosmith show.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.900]   It's just that there would be 100,000 people there instead
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.780]   of on the order of hundreds.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.500]   But I see what you're saying.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.500]   And it's true.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.700]   When I do a show like that, the audience really does make me
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.340]   feel like a rock star, which if you know me at all is
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:57.940]   hilarious.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.980]   Because that's how I feel inside.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.140]   I'm going to say one more thing, and I'm going to let the
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:02.820]   panel join in.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.740]   But from a very personal point of view, I think that from
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.380]   the individual's point of view, having 10,000 fans like
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.540]   that or a million fans like that, it's kind of
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.020]   indistinguishable.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.540]   I mean, you can only absorb so much anyway.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.780]   That's probably true.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.940]   If you've got 50 fans in the lobby of your hotel, you've
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.700]   got 50 fans.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.580]   It doesn't matter that there's a million others who would
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.700]   like to be there.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.380]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.460]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.020]   That's a good point.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:35.020]   It's like the version of it that I have direct access to
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.060]   that I can actually process is that side.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.100]   That's kind of how I feel about it.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.860]   If it got any bigger, I don't know--
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.620]   my brain would explode.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.060]   You and me both, believe me.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.300]   I think that's what makes this so wonderful in terms of
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.660]   not just the business opportunities, but what does it
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.180]   mean to be a corporation in America?
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.300]   It means that you're legally obligated to constantly
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.020]   grow, whether you want to or not.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.780]   And if you're a one-person show or, say, a five-person show,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.060]   you get to make a lot of your own decisions about who you
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.060]   want to please and for how much.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.140]   And I think that--
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.220]   I guess one term you could use for this is microbranding or
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:09.940]   whatever you want to call it.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.580]   But what it comes down to is you have incredibly low
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.540]   costs of running your business associated with serving
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.540]   exactly the people who you want to serve.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.620]   And I think once you start doing that, it's kind of
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.620]   intoxicating and realizing that you can make a living by
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.180]   just talking to the people that you really want to talk to
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.060]   and not having to serve an Aerosmith-sized audience.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.820]   And I think that's, apart from the fact that just the--
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.420]   my gosh, the enthusiasm of your audience, which is really
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.620]   completely intoxicating, I think it's just really cool that
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.260]   you're doing that so well.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.780]   And I think it's through some model.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.860]   I said to you at the show that night, I think you're going
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.300]   to be recognized as patient zero in terms of like five
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.620]   years from now, a lot of label guys wondering, what in
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.580]   the hell happened?
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.460]   That's exactly-- and that's why we're doing a Twitter
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.500]   around this, because that's exactly how I see it as well,
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.660]   I'm really--
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.420]   Now Ryan, you and Tom were in the audience.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.780]   So you have-- I guess we were in the audience for a little
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.020]   bit, but did you have that same reaction sitting there?
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.580]   Had you been to a Jonathan Colton concert before?
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.700]   No, I hadn't--
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.140]   Yeah, go ahead, Ryan.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:05.700]   No, no, go ahead, Tom.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.420]   Oh, you'd be polite first.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.340]   Go ahead, Tom.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:09.860]   I'll vote.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.260]   Tom.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.420]   Well, yeah, I just want to say I had never been to a
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.220]   Jonathan Colton concert, because he doesn't come out
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.860]   here as often, because he lives in Brooklyn.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.580]   That was very exciting.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.500]   Because he hates San Francisco.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.020]   And now California, I believe.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.300]   But he said he loves San Francisco.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:24.860]   That's better.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.700]   Yeah, that's better.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.260]   He hates California.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.260]   That's a song, by the way.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.420]   He hates California.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.660]   But what was interesting, I have been to a Taylor Hicks
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.620]   concert as well, who was an American Idol winner, right?
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.340]   With the curious--
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.580]   I'm curious to be where this goes.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.420]   And there were not as many people at the Taylor Hicks
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.820]   San Francisco show.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.660]   They were not dressing up as Taylor Hicks songs.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.180]   They were not as involved.
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.620]   They were not as excited.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.260]   And they were mostly teenage girls.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.620]   Going to a Jonathan Colton song, or a Jonathan Colton concert,
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.940]   you saw a sold out show.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.620]   And I know there were people who talked about wanting to go
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.180]   to the show who couldn't, because it was sold out.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.020]   And so even if it isn't an Aerosmith size audience, you
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.700]   think about comparing it to other smaller acts that are sort
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.140]   of Sony's attempt at proprietary formats is to just throw a
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.180]   bunch of stuff out there.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.180]   And every once in a while, one like Blu-ray hits, and they
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.580]   make a billion dollars.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.620]   That's what their record companies do as well.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.740]   But instead of just trying stuff and throwing it against the
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.260]   wall and see if you get an audience, Jonathan, I think,
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.940]   has developed an audience that is a much higher quality of
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:35.660]   an audience.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.060]   And you could see that there.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.380]   You could see that every single person there was really
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.460]   there, really excited, really into the show.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.620]   They weren't just there to be seen and walking around.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.940]   I mean, the bar was empty, for goodness sake.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.940]   It never been to a show where there was nobody at the bar.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.660]   They were all watching the show.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.540]   Actually, Merlin was at the bar.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.740]   Actually, it's funny.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.060]   I single-handedly kept the bar open.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.260]   But also, I noticed the inhaler table was getting a lot of
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.100]   things.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   Are you offering refills?
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.140]   Or what was that?
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.220]   So Jonathan, can I ask what neighborhood of Brooklyn do you
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:07.940]   live in?
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.020]   I live in Park Slope.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:09.540]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.300]   I love it.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.860]   So I lived in New York for like six years.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.900]   I moved out to San Francisco about a year and a half ago.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.420]   I lived in Williamsburg for a while.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.820]   And the reason I ask is because you're definitely playing to
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.820]   the audience, I think, out here.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.740]   And I'm just going to throw this out there, maybe I'm
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.500]   completely wrong.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.060]   But I feel like in terms of cities to play in America, you're
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.660]   going to get the nerdiest, geekiest audience in San
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.300]   Francisco.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.100]   Pretty much hands down.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:30.660]   I'm going to--
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.180]   maybe I'm completely off base.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.180]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.580]   This is why I love San Francisco.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.940]   There are few cities that are really great for me.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.420]   And, you know, incidentally, New York is not one of them.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:44.180]   There are great crowds here, but they are not as insane as
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:48.900]   they are in cities like San Francisco, Seattle.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:49.780]   Boston.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.260]   Boston.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.340]   Boston is very good.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:54.340]   Chicago as well.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.500]   I mean, you just name the cities where the nerds are.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.460]   Well, that's exactly what it is.
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.260]   And you talk about it.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.380]   It makes it very obvious to me that it is a really
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.500]   powerful niche thing.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.780]   And it's also, I think, the other reason that it works out
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:16.140]   so well is that, you know, geeks and tech people are fans
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:21.380]   of things in a way that other people are not fans of things.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:26.100]   You know, the fandom in the world means a particular kind
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.260]   of dedication.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.860]   We're much more willing to put on the pointy years.
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.500]   That's exactly right.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.860]   That's my very definition of a nerd.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.260]   It's not that you're into technology or that you're into,
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.580]   you know, whatever American idol, it's that you're whatever
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.940]   you're into, you're just obsessed with it.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.580]   You can be a nerd really cool.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.620]   You know, you could be a nerd for fashion.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.140]   It's the thing that makes it rare, though, is, yeah, you'll
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.700]   see so whatever somebody like from Star Trek, you know,
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.980]   who will show up at a COVID convention or something.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.060]   But the level of engagement, I mean, the lack of condescension
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.140]   toward your fans is really, I think, really just awesome.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.820]   And the fact that you seem really into it.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.540]   And when they show up with the pointy years on, like you're
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.100]   not just like, I'm here to pick up a check.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.500]   Like you're really into the fact that these people have gotten
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.940]   super engaged with these songs of yours.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.940]   I saw Jonathan make so many people's night at that show,
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.420]   like the zombie table, they were all like their heads were
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.940]   about to explode with Glee.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.900]   They were so happy that you pointed them out and we're
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:27.700]   talking to them.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.140]   And then Andy Bates.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.020]   Andy Bates.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.660]   What's the story with Andy Bates?
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:32.980]   OK.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.020]   God bless Andy Bates.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.020]   I don't know.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.300]   I'll play the story with Andy Bates.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.820]   So this is during the song "Kairan Beta Prime."
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.140]   I usually like to ask a volunteer from the audience to come
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.900]   up and sing the robot line.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.900]   The very fact that you could do that without telling them
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.540]   what to sing.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.740]   And it works.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.220]   Tells us all right there.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.900]   Andy Bates in particular, he told me-- he came up to me
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.980]   after the show and he said, this is the guy that got chosen.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.060]   And I chose him because when I said, I need a volunteer, he
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.260]   like stood up on his chair and raised his hand immediately.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:00.940]   He sure did.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.260]   He was like, 10 feet tall.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.860]   And I was like, OK, that's my guy.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.220]   And he was wearing a bow tie.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.940]   And he was so excited because he had been to, I think, two
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.100]   shows before that and had volunteered and not been chosen.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.100]   Oh.
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.780]   And he did not have a ticket to this show.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.060]   And it was sold out.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.300]   And he checked on-- he asked on the forums on my site.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.180]   And there was somebody who had like six extra tickets, who
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.060]   was giving them out to all these singletons who didn't have
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.060]   a ticket and wanted to come.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.620]   So then at the end of the day, there
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.860]   were a group of like six or seven people who didn't know each
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.900]   other, who all went together to the show.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.780]   And he was one of those people.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.260]   And I just thought that was the coolest thing.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.180]   And then when he came up, he was just so excited.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.940]   And he was so into it.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.420]   And he made the show.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.700]   I mean, he made that song.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.180]   It was like, was the greatest thing to watch him do that.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.340]   So really to make this of use to other people, I think--
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.660]   I mean, it's wonderful to bask in the glory of our rock
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.660]   stardom Veronica and Marlon.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.780]   God knows, I'll never forget it.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.660]   But what I find interesting is how this came about.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.740]   So Jonathan, you were a computer programmer,
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.380]   and you had a hobby of music.
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.540]   What was the story there?
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.340]   Yeah, I mean, I had always been interested in making a living
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.420]   as a musician, but never could quite figure out
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.140]   how to go about doing it.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.380]   Also, I think I was afraid for a long time.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.260]   But yeah, I wrote software at a small firm in Manhattan
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.380]   for about nine years.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.540]   Can I ask which firm?
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.340]   Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of them.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.420]   It's called Cluins.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.420]   They make database software for executive recruiting firms.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.780]   Did you write log-in pages?
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.620]   Was it your code functional and elegant?
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.060]   Oh my god, we're just as bad as the people in the audience.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.060]   If you guys are a bunch of people, do you?
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.580]   Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.420]   Yeah, I did write log-in pages.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.900]   And my code was functional and not at all elegant.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.740]   But it got the job done.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.580]   And then I had done music on the side.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.020]   And it was sort of a hobby thing.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.820]   I was certainly not making a living from it.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.940]   But I had put a CD together, a sort of vanity press kind of thing.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.820]   And then it was after my daughter was born.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.980]   I said, well, geez, I'm actually mortal.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.620]   I'm going to die.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.740]   This proves this, because here is the generation
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.140]   that will take my place.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:32.380]   And I better get off my butt and do something.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.940]   And that was really the moment.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:40.580]   So I quit the job and just started doing this song a week thing,
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.500]   recording a new song every week and putting it out on my side.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.260]   And you were giving those away?
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.900]   It was basically it was a podcast.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.540]   They were all in an RSS feed.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.500]   And I kind of feel like I got lucky.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.180]   They were just a couple of songs that got linked by the right people.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.780]   And before I knew it, more and more people were paying attention.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.100]   We played Code Monkey like 8,000 times.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.980]   I felt like an AM radio disc jockey.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.820]   And now let's listen to that song one more time.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.860]   Code Monkey.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.860]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.420]   No, but actually, I think that that speaks directly
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.780]   to the meritocracy that is the internet and the blogosphere.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.620]   Exactly.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.020]   The theory of the standing theory is
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.140]   that it's not necessarily about the resources you have behind you.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.460]   It's that great things, great content, great people.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.980]   And ideas will flow to the top.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.380]   And that's, I think, really what's
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:36.500]   at the core of any success like this is you can't fake goodness.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.020]   No, that has to be something there.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.140]   That's a fundamental question that I get asked all the time.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.180]   Well, OK, if there's a million web pages,
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.620]   how do people find me?
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.140]   Is it really a meritocracy?
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.340]   Or can I just get swamped by all the other content?
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.500]   Will the best always rise and be discovered?
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.580]   I believe so, yeah.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.700]   Because it's not-- well, I mean, it's not just about being good,
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:56.860]   right?
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.020]   You can't be good once.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.100]   And then that's it, right?
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.940]   You can't write one great song and then expect
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.140]   to be Aerosmith or what have you.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.100]   I think it's a package.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.180]   It's a package because if you think about it,
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.340]   if you ever get tired of us just kissing your butt, Jonathan,
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.020]   you can just hang up.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.980]   Why would I ever get tired of that?
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.060]   Well, here's what I think.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.340]   This is what makes Jonathan the perfect storm in some ways
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.100]   is the-- yes, he put out stuff.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.940]   First of all, he had a container for it, right?
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.500]   Like, what is one thing that makes something
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.300]   interesting to people is an expectation
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.540]   of what's going to be happening, what's
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.260]   going to be coming along.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.500]   And Jonathan said, even if it kills me,
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.780]   I'm going to put out about a song a week.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.700]   Brilliant.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.540]   And so really, now that's created an expectation with people.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.900]   But then second of all, the elephant in the room
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.740]   is he gave it away.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.900]   So Jonathan understood that if there's
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.660]   going to be revenue streams associated with this,
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.180]   it wasn't just something of going like, OK, before I've even
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.260]   gotten your interest, you have to give me a dollar.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.700]   So he found this way of saying, I'm going to put this out
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:47.980]   there.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.180]   And now there's this audience of people
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.540]   who are buying box sets of stuff they already downloaded
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.220]   for free, because he's created a relationship.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.420]   And that's a whole different thing from just saying, oh,
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.300]   how do I do SEO for my site so that I can kind of compel
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.020]   people to find me on Google?
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:08.260]   I think it's interesting to think about, for instance,
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.420]   babies got back, right?
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.060]   That was how I was at a great time.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.300]   That was covered, Jonathan, right?
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.580]   It was linked by Boeing Boeing.
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.460]   So somebody at Boeing Boeing finds it,
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.460]   thinks it's good enough to blog.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.500]   Enough people see it on Boeing Boeing
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.300]   and think it's good enough to talk about to their friends
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.100]   and think about.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.460]   And other people started blogging about it.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.220]   And I have to say, I saw that.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.660]   I looked around on Jonathan's site.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.500]   I was like, oh, this guy looks really cool.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.100]   I think W's duty was the next song that I got, which I was like,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.260]   OK, that's kind of funny.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.820]   And then Code Monkey came along.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.020]   I don't know when I found that.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.500]   I was like, oh, it's that guy, Jonathan Colton.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.180]   So it's sort of--
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.940]   I don't know that everything good rises to the top,
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.180]   but I think it has to be good to rise.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.620]   In other words, there's so many bumps
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.580]   that you have to get over with people
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.220]   to really get their mind share, that you have to be good two
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.100]   or three times.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.300]   And that's when you're like, oh, wow, yeah, that's really
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.140]   something I'm interested in.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.140]   I'm going to go back.
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.940]   But I would ask, Jonathan, you gave him away
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.780]   because you didn't think you could charge for him, right?
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.900]   I mean, it's not like you had a clever plan here.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.260]   No, I really--
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.580]   I wouldn't say it was a clever plan.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:20.740]   I did imagine that it was to my benefit to give them away.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.140]   So you were thinking along the lines of building
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.260]   this career?
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:29.220]   Yeah, I mean, I was really hoping that this is what
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:29.900]   was going to happen.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.780]   People were asking me, what is your plan?
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.420]   What the hell are you doing?
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.980]   How are you going to make a living?
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.660]   And I would always say, I don't know.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.660]   I don't know.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.220]   And really, I think, my secret hope
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.540]   was that it would be like this.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.660]   And I couldn't even really admit to myself
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.300]   that that's what I was hoping was going to happen
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.380]   because it seemed so crazy.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.340]   But the reason I gave them away was because, yeah,
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.220]   at that point, I figured I just wanted as many people
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.660]   to hear them as possible.
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:00.100]   And under the assumption that let's get famous now,
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.900]   and then we can get rich later on.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.420]   Because there's another piece to this,
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.540]   and I think it's fascinating.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.780]   Without saying too much out of school,
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.540]   I chatted with one of your very cool harmonics buddies.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.340]   You're just talking about, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.460]   And just talking about how--
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.020]   I mean, he was really straight up about it.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.740]   He was like, well, Jonathan put all his stuff out
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.940]   on Creative Commons.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.900]   We could sit around and do stuff with his stuff
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.740]   without having to talk to a lawyer.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.340]   And so the thing is, if we wanted to go and do any of this stuff
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.300]   with somebody, the label, A, we'd go there,
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.100]   and they'd say, creative what?
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.540]   And then B, we'd have to go through the phalanx of lawyers
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.580]   before we ever got to do anything.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.140]   And how much can we charge for the ringtone?
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.220]   So I think there's something--
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.620]   that's why I say it's a perfect storm.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.140]   It's a kind of openness that's about more than just money
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.820]   or just free as in--
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.020]   free as in beer, free as in speech.
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.740]   Like you're throwing stuff out there and saying,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.460]   I think to an extent, you're saying,
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.180]   I have a personality and a set of things
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.980]   that I think might interest you beyond just trying
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:54.060]   to pick your pocket for this one thing that's a hit right now.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.940]   So should we expect a Jonathan Colton rock band pack
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.900]   anytime soon?
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.900]   That would be fantastic, wouldn't it?
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.220]   I'd buy rock band just for that.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.580]   I would buy it just for Skullcrusher Mountain, I would totally--
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.820]   Oh, I want to play and sing Skullcrusher Mountain.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.820]   Absolutely not.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.980]   Can I be the henchman?
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.100]   I'm going to be scared face.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.020]   Listen, if it happened, if it happened,
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.180]   you guys-- that's when we get the band back together
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.660]   and we do another show.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.540]   All right, I'm going to start practicing now.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.180]   Maybe by then I'll be able to play bass on easy.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.460]   I don't know for any time, Leo.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.660]   Geez.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.180]   I actually am going to buy rock band,
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.700]   even though it's like 250 bucks with all those instruments.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.580]   Yeah, it's not a donated dollars.
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.460]   How much?
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:31.980]   180.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.860]   Oh, well.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.260]   Fifth-- actually a target, I think.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.820]   I'm going to target after the show.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:36.420]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.420]   I got to go to home and see Joan Rivers on the red carpet.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.460]   No, I think it's very interesting to see what's happened then
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.340]   since then.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.380]   Now, at this point, you're selling records.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.460]   In fact, I just bought the complete--
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.340]   for $70.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.580]   You get-- I mean, it costs less than the whole complete Led Zeppelin
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.180]   and there are more songs on there than I
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.580]   want to listen to, frankly.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.460]   That was my Christmas present to myself.
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:01.980]   It's great.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.140]   It's great.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.020]   So do you sell a lot of music online?
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.700]   I mean, is this working out?
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.380]   I actually ran the numbers for last year
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.860]   and it was about 40% of my income
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.140]   was digital downloads.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.060]   And the rest was performance?
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:22.420]   And the rest was split between merchandise,
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.100]   which means physical CDs and t-shirts.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.660]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.100]   And live shows, you know, to ticket sales from live shows.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.900]   So people still want the CDs?
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.020]   Someone said it's true.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.100]   People will download everything.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.420]   And then when they're at the show,
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.820]   they'll just buy the CDs anyway.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.900]   Because what it really comes down to, I think,
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.740]   is-- and this is what I've always believed--
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:52.900]   was so misguided about the language around the RIAA position
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.500]   is that, you know, actually fans very much
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.420]   want to support artists.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.580]   I agree.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.420]   You know?
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.940]   And the fact is that this is another part
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.660]   of what I was doing is I was always
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.340]   very clear from the beginning.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:09.060]   I would love for you to give me some money, like that.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.780]   I am actually trying to make a living this way.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:11.980]   And, you know, with the help--
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.660]   There's my mistake.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.300]   I've never said that.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.140]   Nobody knows.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.500]   I would love for you to give me money, folks.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.500]   No, but I mean, I think--
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.780]   I think that's really good.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.860]   That's part of the transparency.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.380]   It would just be very upfront.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.540]   You know, look, I'd like to be a professional musician.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.300]   And if you want me to keep making music,
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.180]   I'm going to need to be making money from it
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.900]   or else I'm going to get a day job at Camden.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.660]   But it also--
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.580]   That's kind of goes back to what Merlin was saying, right?
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.300]   Because you're not a corporation,
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.620]   you don't have to apologize for making money.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:44.620]   That's exactly right.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.900]   To a niche audience, look, Aerosmith, they make plenty of money.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.180]   I don't mind stealing their music.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.060]   Well, Jonathan, no.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.660]   I mean, he can't be making that much.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:52.420]   Look at his t-shirt.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.860]   We got to buy his music.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.380]   Right.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.380]   So I thought that's also a question of the kinds of--
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.220]   I mean, I've always thought that you can tell a lot about a corporation
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.540]   by the kinds of problems that they're comfortable solving.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.740]   And it's true about people, too.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.340]   But if you look at somebody putting out a Michael Jackson album
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.180]   or whatever a superstar album or whatever the kids like today,
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.420]   that's a very costly venture, just because of the--
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.100]   taking the same thing for movies.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.780]   You go look at movies now and look at-- like year over year,
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.300]   how much of the total budget for films is marketing now.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:18.980]   And that's fine.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.620]   If you want to be in the business of making $140 million movies,
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.780]   that's OK.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.660]   But you've got to look at-- as I say, the cost of ownership
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.860]   and the cost of doing business when you're a very small operation
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.980]   is very attractive.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.260]   It's just not the kind of problem that a large corporation
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.140]   can solve.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.980]   So there's all this opportunity out there.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.420]   You don't need to be famous with 100 million people.
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.220]   You can be really famous with 10,000 people.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.620]   And if it's the right 10,000 people, you'll make a living from it.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:41.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.300]   But so the question is, can you make a living from it?
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.500]   You can be famous with the-- with niche audiences.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.060]   But is this enough to build a business around?
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.300]   Is it enough to live on?
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.540]   And then the question I want to know from Jonathan
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.660]   is without talking too much about your personal finances.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.180]   Or do you think that it's feasible?
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.060]   Do you think that people can actually make this happen for themselves
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.540]   as independent musicians working outside of the record label
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.180]   system as we know it today?
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.740]   Well, I will tell you, without getting into specific numbers,
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:19.580]   I will say that last year I made more money than I did the last year
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.900]   I worked as a software designer.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:22.740]   That's all you need to know.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.500]   I mean, you're making a better living.
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.020]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.300]   And that wasn't even an important goal.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.700]   I didn't want it to pass my income.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.540]   I wanted to match it or get close to it.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.180]   Well, you have a family?
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.140]   Yes, exactly.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.540]   So it was important for me to continue making money.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.500]   Right.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.020]   Fighting a family.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:41.500]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:45.340]   But you know, the real-- and as far as I'm concerned,
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.620]   like that's it.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.900]   Like that's success.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.100]   I have no idea how long it's going to last.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.660]   And I don't know.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.300]   I'm not convinced that I'm going to become super rich off of this.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:03.580]   But I would sure be pleased if I could do this for a decade or longer.
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:09.660]   And I have to say, the numbers just keep on improving.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.260]   And the crowds are constantly getting bigger.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.660]   And I have like 50% new visitors to my website.
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.860]   So it's still building.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.820]   I keep waiting for the backlash.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.900]   And maybe all these bad YouTube comments at the beginning.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:29.740]   Well, so it's interesting because we're talking about how these kinds of artists/performer
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.620]   life cycles go.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.180]   And typically, I've known a lot of friends in very successful bands.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:40.980]   And you kind of reach this threshold where you actually start making money from selling
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.220]   rights and doing things like what you did with Portal.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.340]   So is that kind of like-- was that ever a goal?
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.500]   Is that something you see as an eventuality for independent musicians is kind of get the
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   commercial play?
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.100]   Like kind of white stripes made it really big early on.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.900]   Like I said, that one single that was in every commercial ever.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.700]   So how crucial is that kind of Portal interaction?
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:12.420]   I mean, I think that David Byrne interviewed Radiohead for Wired.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.660]   And Inity was talking about the data, the record industry.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:21.980]   And he said, your ownership of that music is your pension.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:28.300]   And I think that's certainly true for a lot of super famous musicians from the old guard.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:34.020]   And I think it's also certainly going to continue to be true with independent musicians.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:40.660]   And I haven't had the opportunity to sell out in that way.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.860]   So I don't know precisely how I'd navigate that.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:50.660]   If they wanted me to use a piece of music for a four hour--
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.500]   Do you feel like that's changed much?
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:57.220]   I mean, because I remember a few years ago, just to be perfectly honest, when the shins
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:02.220]   sold New slang to McDonald's for a French fry commercial, I just about lost it.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:07.020]   I mean, I was really-- partly because they had this video that was about kind of a homage
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.380]   to all my favorite '80s bands.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.380]   And I was totally sucked in.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.140]   And then I saw it in a commercial during the Super Bowl.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.740]   And I was beside myself.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:17.020]   But I got to say now, I see like, OK, whatever, the apples and stereo can buy a van now.
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.740]   Or you see that this is really an alternate revenue stream.
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.460]   And if we're going to sit around and download music all day, I'm not saying, I do.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.460]   I hear it happens.
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.660]   But if you're going to do that, there has to be a way for the artists to get paid.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.340]   And it seems to me like the artists who have the highest levels of engagement with their
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:33.860]   fans and have stuff to sell at the shows are going to-- because I know all kinds of people
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.180]   that are like, yeah, I'm going to go see them.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.180]   I'm going to buy a ticket.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.180]   I'm going to buy some drinks.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.340]   And I'm going to walk away with $50 worth of merchandise because I really like this fan.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.300]   But I think it's-- maybe even if it doesn't just apply to musicians, it applies to bloggers,
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:49.100]   it applies to podcasters, to everything, every other kind of internet creation, which we
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.900]   don't necessarily have live performances.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.260]   But engagement is critical.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:55.300]   Building a community around you is critical.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.900]   And I think brings longevity in a way that--
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:58.900]   You think it's changing?
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.940]   No, Jonathan, do you see that attitude about like we're five years ago?
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:05.780]   Like if you had said, hey, I'm going to sell like super chunks, sold their song to British
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.020]   knights and people call them sellouts or whatever.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.180]   Like what-- do you see that attitude changing?
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.340]   I think so.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.780]   Only because I sort of feel that same change in myself.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:21.540]   But it used to feel like something shameful.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.060]   And now when I think about it, it doesn't feel that shameful.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.820]   And maybe that's because I am the one who stamped the benefits from it.
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.020]   You're paying for your own insurance.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.020]   That's why it doesn't work.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.020]   Exactly.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.020]   But yeah, I think--
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.020]   I think--
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:34.020]   But also, it depends on the context, though.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.020]   I mean, you're doing it for an awesome video game.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.020]   I mean--
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.020]   Well, that's true.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.020]   --how much better can you get than that?
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.820]   I wouldn't have said that doing Portal was as at all selling out.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.980]   I mean, I think that's really playing to the fan base.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.980]   How did that come about?
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:45.980]   That's what I said, yeah.
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.340]   Did harmonics approach you, Jonathan?
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.580]   The Portal thing came about they--
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:53.100]   Battle.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.020]   Not harmonics, but I was--
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.460]   Somebody from Valve came to a show of mine.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.780]   The Kim Swift actually came to a show of mine in Seattle
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.500]   and came up to me afterwards and said, we're from Valve.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.100]   And I said, oh, I love Valve.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.260]   I love Half-Life.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.580]   And then she said, would you ever
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.660]   be interested in writing music?
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.620]   I said, sure.
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:10.780]   They flew me out there.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.020]   And we talked about stuff.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.340]   And I played Portal.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.820]   And I met Eric Wollpauff, one of the writers.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:23.300]   And it became pretty clear that we had a nice overlap
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.500]   of sensibility.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:31.180]   And that's when we decided that Gladys should sing a little
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:32.380]   song at the end of the game.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.820]   Oh, that's so great.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:34.740]   But of course, you couldn't have gone--
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.980]   I mean, you're not going to go to Tony Bennett or Bert
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.420]   Bakarak to write the theme for this.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.260]   It's clear that you understand--
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.900]   you're able to throw the references,
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.620]   appropriate references in.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.940]   You mentioned Black Mesa.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.540]   I mean, it's--
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:55.300]   Well, it was definitely the kind of thing where we were working
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.060]   on the same creative direction.
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.540]   And I think that's why it worked so well.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.780]   Did they give you some lines, or was it all yours?
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.100]   They gave me plenty of references.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.420]   We talked a great deal about the backstory.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:12.700]   And he said, she hates Black Mesa, so you can play with that.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.340]   And there's this thing about cake.
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.940]   So do something with that.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.860]   It is the best ending of a video game ever.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.340]   Most of the time you beat the boss--
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.420]   I'm looking at Bioshock, which was a great game.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.300]   You beat the boss.
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.380]   It's anti-climactic.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:30.060]   You play Portal just to get to the song.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.580]   Yeah, I'm doing that right now.
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.780]   Honestly, there's actually something--
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.620]   I've been wondering, and this is something
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.940]   that my friend Chris, who was Chris Grant,
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:37.900]   he's the editor of Joystick.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.060]   He requested specifically that I ask.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.060]   Are you familiar with Spike TV's video game awards, Chew?
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.540]   Yeah, sure.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:49.740]   OK, so in previous years, they've done a best song
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.860]   written for a video game category.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.700]   And pretty much it's always been crappy,
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.540]   because nobody writes any good music.
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.540]   Right.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.020]   And then-- so did they ask you to be a part of it this year?
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.940]   Because they left that category out of the awards.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.580]   And this was the one year that there was actually a song.
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.700]   There was actually a song written for it.
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.540]   You know, I think that--
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.940]   you know, I confess I did not watch the show.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.460]   And now I'm not certain that the--
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.060]   I don't think anybody said either.
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.020]   Who cares?
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:18.220]   Well, no, I think they actually had me perform the song.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:22.620]   I know that I performed the song to tape for them to use,
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:26.260]   I think, on the show in some way, but not in terms
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.500]   of it being an award, just in terms of it being related to--
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.860]   Maybe because they knew there was no chance anything else
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.060]   could win against you.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.420]   They're just going to show the performance
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.340]   and, you know, to hack with the category.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.100]   You were robbed, Jonathan, you were robbed.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.940]   They wanted to spare everybody else the embarrassment
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.020]   of getting horribly pronounced by me.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:43.860]   Hey, that raises the issue.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.180]   I can't buy still alive, can't.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:48.540]   I mean, I can listen to YouTube versions of it.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.900]   No, you can buy them from the Amazon MP3 store.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:51.500]   You can.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.740]   You can buy both versions, actually.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.260]   You can, yeah.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.420]   You can perform by Jonathan and the one from the game.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.820]   But it didn't come in my--
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.860]   Orange Box soundtrack.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.860]   My $70.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:03.860]   Oh, we all pulled in complete collection.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.340]   Actually, I can't--
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:05.860]   I can't--
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:06.900]   It's not yours to sell.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.460]   No.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.660]   Well, I'm going to go on Amazon and buy it.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.060]   That's fine.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:10.380]   I don't mind.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:10.940]   You should.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.380]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.220]   I love that song.
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.460]   It's funny.
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.660]   I mean, there's something about that song.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.740]   Maybe it's because you spent the last eight hours
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.420]   beating Portal.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.100]   Well, I really think it's--
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.980]   I give Eric so much credit.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.060]   He's such a funny and smart guy.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:29.780]   And he's the writer of GLADOS, basically.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.780]   And I think that the genius of that game
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:33.540]   is that character.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.380]   She is so wonderfully complex.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.980]   And beating her feels--
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.140]   you feel guilty about it kind of.
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.660]   Because you sort of feel sorry for her.
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.860]   She's just crazy.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:45.220]   You know?
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:45.900]   I don't know.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.220]   I don't feel that sorry for her.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.820]   She's murderous, but she's also--
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:49.980]   She's kind of sweet.
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.460]   She's kind of sweet, and she just messed up.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.180]   She's like the guy on Skull Crusher Island.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:55.700]   Exactly.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:57.220]   You write a lot of characters like that.
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.980]   Well, that's why it was such a perfect matchup.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.500]   It's this horrible monster who doesn't
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.980]   see what the big deal is about.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.900]   Why is everybody so upset at me?
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.620]   But that's why it works is because there's
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.740]   this character that you've grown to know and hate
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.460]   flash love over the course of the game.
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.700]   And then she sings you a song.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.740]   But what else do you need?
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.900]   And she's just a minute in the song.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.540]   I found something, an idea, that I'm totally
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.220]   going to steal from you.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.260]   I'd never seen this before.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.860]   And I think it's the best idea ever.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:28.260]   You go to JonathanCoulton.com/primmer.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.900]   He's got this excellent-- so you decided
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.740]   to listen to Jonathan Coulton.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.100]   Here's what you should know first.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.380]   He said this awesome page at JonathanCoulton.com/primmer
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:39.340]   slash listen.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.140]   And he's like, OK, so here's some songs.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.820]   Here's my foremost popular songs.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.620]   Here's four funny songs.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.260]   Here's four sad songs.
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.980]   And here's four funny slash sad songs.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:49.940]   Here's one.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:51.660]   Here's four geeky songs.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:52.900]   And here's four sweet songs.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:54.460]   I thought that was such a good idea.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.380]   And I'm very first of all, kudos for that.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.540]   But I also, just quickly, I love the fact
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.420]   that you write these songs that have--
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:03.580]   you write about it's a squid.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.300]   It's like the Midas Touch, right?
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.340]   You get this squid that wants to touch things,
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:09.220]   but he keeps crushing everything.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.100]   I got all misty-eyed during the show.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.140]   I've got all these songs that are like these characters
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:19.940]   who are like horribly flawed monsters that have--
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.980]   where does that come from?
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:22.700]   I don't know.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.020]   I'm sure it's in me.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.620]   I'm sure it's-- comes from 10 years of writing C code.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.740]   What are you talking about?
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.500]   I owe.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.820]   There's a touch of parody in the songs
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:37.620]   where you're very good at emulating a normal song which
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.100]   would just be a boring old love song.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.660]   But you've thrown in these very creative elements
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.980]   like the squid that lend them some depth.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.420]   And like the one about--
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.380]   Oh gosh, is it the future?
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.660]   Caron and flute over.
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.060]   The future soon is like a Jerry Chape and song.
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.780]   So it's got the little twist in the end,
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.020]   which is that her eyes have been ruined by the robots he
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:56.860]   created.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.260]   And I think it's just something that's very cheap.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.500]   That's very cheap and ask, isn't it?
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:00.580]   It's totally.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.260]   I'd stay out of cars.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.260]   More importantly, it's your podcast also.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:05.620]   Really with podcasts?
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:10.900]   Jonathan, if you get a lot of comparisons to Steven Matt.
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:14.020]   You know, I don't get a love comparison.
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.260]   Not that I know of.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.140]   It never struck me, but then you had the ukulele
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.020]   and Meg McInfield.
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.380]   She was great, by the way.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:21.340]   No, it was like--
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:21.980]   It's terrific, yeah.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:23.780]   You did put out that triple record
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.940]   that was all about robots, which was kind of like--
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.420]   69 robot songs?
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.220]   Is that what it was?
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.060]   Man robots, that's great.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.300]   So what podcast uses his song Veronica?
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.500]   Sword and laser.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.820]   That's your podcast.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.300]   Yes.
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.740]   Sword and laser pointer.
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.260]   Don't sue us.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.060]   No, I won't.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.900]   If you get behind a creative comment, baby.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.860]   He's kidding.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.420]   I asked Jonathan's permission to,
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.260]   even though it was Creative Commons,
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.180]   just because I was seeing him in person.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.140]   And I've seen that for some time.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:50.860]   Oh, thank you so much.
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:51.540]   That's good.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.460]   And he looked at me like, it's--
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.260]   As long as you don't make any money on it, you can do it.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.580]   We don't make any money at all.
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.140]   Island.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.900]   Not a hard thing to do in podcasting.
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:01.900]   It's very so much better.
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.100]   As a matter of fact.
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.140]   Yes, indeed.
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.500]   So Jonathan, what tools do you--
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.620]   I mean, clearly, you can't just be a musician
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:09.980]   if you're going to take this path.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.780]   You have to have some marketing instinct, which you do.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.540]   I mean, the primer is a perfect example.
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.620]   I'm sure you wouldn't label yourself a marketer.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:20.620]   What tools, what skills you think somebody who wanted
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.660]   to follow your path should have, besides being a good songwriter?
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:28.220]   Well, I think on top of whatever musical stuff there is there,
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:31.980]   I think that having the ability to set up a website
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:37.180]   and to run my own website has been really helpful to me,
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.940]   just because I didn't have to pay somebody to do it.
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.660]   There's no disconnect between what I want to do
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.220]   and what it does.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.780]   That's been a really nice thing.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:50.860]   And on top of that, I've always been interested in tech
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.300]   and staying up on stuff.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:57.900]   So I'm constantly reading about all of these new tools
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.260]   that are out there, whether it's like the 61,
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.260]   it's a good example.
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.940]   This website where you can upload music
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:10.060]   and it's crazy voting scheme that people can give songs
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.940]   a bump and it costs you a certain number of points
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.740]   to bump the song.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.300]   But if people behind you bump the song,
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.140]   then you get more points back.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.100]   And it's just this attempt at creating some kind
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:26.060]   of meritocracy of independent music.
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:31.220]   And so I read about these things because I'm interested in them
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:32.220]   and I want to know about them.
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.100]   And then I see them and I try them out.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.180]   I think that, above all, the fact
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.900]   that I am interested enough in this stuff
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:46.580]   to just try everything and watch for new stuff all the time.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:49.060]   And then I just keep the things that work.
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.500]   The motto of the 61, by the way, is radio sucks.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:53.780]   So let's do something about it.
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.340]   And I think that's part of the issue, is that the music industry
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:59.420]   has very limited promotional tools, primarily radio
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.660]   and billboards on Sunset Strip.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.260]   And this is where you have a huge advantage
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.460]   by understanding technology and having an affinity
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.660]   and interest in it.
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.620]   You can use these tools that our brand knew that--
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.380]   I mean, I doubt very much that anybody at Capitol Records
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.060]   is looking at the 61.
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:13.860]   No, no.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.540]   Well, they wouldn't.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:18.260]   Well, also, because the music streams
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.660]   and you don't get paid for it.
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:21.140]   Oh, no.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:21.580]   I know.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.460]   Isn't that terrible?
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.700]   What a horrible idea.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.660]   How can we make ringtones?
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.660]   Exactly.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.460]   Oh, I hate ringtones so much.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.420]   I was wondering why you haven't tried the--
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.140]   I mean, I think there'll be some good licks in your--
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.820]   Well, I do have a-- there's a ringtones area in my site,
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:39.420]   but I just point you to a site called Mixertones,
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.700]   where you can upload MP3 and make you round,
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:45.420]   because I find the idea of selling ringtones very offensive.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.780]   Now, this is an interesting issue,
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.500]   because if you're going to play to this audience,
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:53.660]   you have to tread lightly and carefully not to offend them.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.540]   And there are-- you just echoed the absolute sentiments
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:57.980]   of most geeks about ringtones.
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:59.620]   Were you to suddenly sell ringtones?
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.140]   There would be a group of people would say, oh, he sold out.
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:05.380]   Yeah, I'm conscious of that.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:10.460]   It hasn't really been an issue, because I kind of agree with--
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.740]   You share that sensibility.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:13.260]   I mean--
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.500]   Don't worry all the time about doing something
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.900]   that's going to offend the core.
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.420]   Oh, sure.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.820]   Well, that's the problem with being a niche artist.
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.940]   That if you-- if you picked up the niche, you got nobody.
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.060]   Yeah, you live and die by the niche.
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:27.460]   Can you be successful in a niche?
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:28.340]   You have to be successful in a niche, I think.
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.460]   Yeah, you have to be of the niche.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:29.780]   That's right.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:30.580]   You can't make it up.
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:34.380]   You can't say, oh, I'm going to go out and serve NASCAR fans.
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:34.900]   Right.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:35.820]   And get it right.
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.260]   You should totally do that, Leo.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.540]   I bet I could do it.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:38.980]   You should do this.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.180]   You should really get into, like, I don't know what--
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.020]   That's what Eric Siegel did.
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.940]   You know, the guy who wrote "Love Story," who's a Harvard
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.980]   professor, he said, I know how to write a bestseller.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.140]   He studied all the bestsellers.
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:51.180]   He totally, formulately, wrote "Love Story,"
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.100]   and he served the niche.
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.820]   The difference is, that was in a day when the audience didn't
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.900]   talk back to you.
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:56.380]   Right.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.580]   You could fake it for a while.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:03.060]   I think Leo would be a very interesting experiment
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.460]   if you actually tried to do that.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.540]   If you said, you know what?
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.780]   I'm going to court the NASCAR niche.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.900]   And I'm going to start a NASCAR podcast
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.540]   and just started doing it and see in what happened.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.900]   It would be interesting, but you know why I don't do it?
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.860]   Because I have no interest in it.
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:14.980]   Who cares?
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.980]   I guess that's true.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.260]   It'd be too much like work.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.020]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.980]   And that's the other nice thing about being
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.340]   in an niche that you're a part of,
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.340]   that it doesn't feel like work.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.620]   You're doing what you want to do.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.820]   You're interested in these sites and these tools and the music.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.980]   And so you're enjoying it.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.260]   You like people coming to your audience carrying pony monkeys.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.300]   Yes, I do.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.580]   You don't mind that.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.940]   Can I ask Jonathan a 43 folders ask question?
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.060]   Yes.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.780]   Jonathan, when we talked just about a year ago for the Merlin
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:46.180]   show, we talked a little bit about your email.
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.420]   I don't know if you remember this.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.180]   I sure do.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.940]   Are you at inbox zero, Jonathan?
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.220]   It was-- that's what I'm curious about.
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.980]   Now, at the time, just for history, for backstory, Jonathan
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.300]   was dealing with a very high volume of email.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:56.900]   And I'm curious.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.500]   Merlin, you're like a proctologist who
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.060]   asks everybody about their butthole.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.260]   Kind of look at your butt.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.260]   Oh, my God.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:02.780]   Wow.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:03.280]   Wow.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:03.780]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.660]   I just want to look at your butt.
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.300]   So Jonathan, my curiosity is like you're out there more
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.260]   than ever now.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:13.020]   Like, how do you stay on top of all the folks
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.260]   who want to get in contact with you?
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.820]   Pink List GPD.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.300]   Oh, come on.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.100]   Are you using it?
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.260]   I am, yeah.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.260]   You're on a--
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.260]   I do.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.300]   I thought you were on a PC.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.060]   What are you talking about?
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.560]   No, Matt.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.660]   Merlin, did you not notice the 12 inch on the stage?
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.540]   I almost-- are you kidding?
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.380]   I almost yanked it.
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.380]   I was going to take it with the drums.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.100]   Don't know, Jonathan.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.220]   But it's a topic every week on Macbreak Weekly
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:37.580]   to figure out where we can find more 12 inches to acquire.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.260]   I'll tell him I'm for a lot of money.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.460]   I'm very happy to hear that.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.140]   And so as far as email and stuff like that,
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.260]   to you, obviously, we talked at the time.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.460]   And you were talking about-- it was very valuable and important
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.700]   to you to be able to keep that line of communication open.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.180]   Is that something you still struggle with?
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.180]   Is that--
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:51.680]   It is.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.340]   It gets harder.
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.660]   It gets gotten harder.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:00.060]   I-- now, the main-- you know, I fall on and off--
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.260]   I'm on and off the wagon with Pink List.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.620]   You know, I'm good about it for a while,
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:09.580]   and I get the inbox down to zero or sometimes 20.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.620]   You know?
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.260]   The inbox 20 is perfectly legitimate.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:12.860]   Right.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.220]   That's OK.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:19.460]   And then-- and then, you know, like, for instance,
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.180]   when I just went out to San Francisco,
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.140]   I was out there for a few days.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.300]   I was very busy.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.460]   I was very nervous.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.860]   I didn't touch my inbox at all.
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:26.700]   You know?
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.740]   And now, today was the day of rest.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.900]   And tomorrow, I'm screwed.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.220]   You know, tomorrow is basically going
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:36.940]   to be a day of moving things out of my inbox into a to-do list.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.260]   That's my problem with inbox zero.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.420]   You're getting no days of rest.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.700]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:45.260]   And so, yeah, it's very hard.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.780]   You know, I have-- I'm behind on a category of emails,
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:53.380]   which are just fan mail that don't require a response,
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.940]   but that I want to respond to anyway.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.420]   That's totally the hardest part.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.700]   Do you ever think about getting help, stuff like that?
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.180]   No, no, no.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.260]   I asked-- I asked Gilcey--
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.700]   It's like Dr. Phil.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.540]   Let's do just a minute now, Jonathan.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:06.500]   Let me ask you something.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.620]   Have you looked in her eyes?
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:10.980]   Have you really looked at this?
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.860]   Do you think I'm curious, though?
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.300]   Because at a certain point, you've got to build capacity.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.940]   Do you give much thought to getting help?
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.940]   Obviously, you probably got an accountant and stuff like that.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.780]   But do you ever think about getting help
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:20.580]   with some of the stuff that--
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.540]   That's a good question.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.660]   What is it I'm curious?
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.580]   So running your own business can kind of suck.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.420]   What are the-- is there stuff that you can afford to shed?
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.780]   And is that something that you have looked into?
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:31.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.180]   And there are some things that I have shed.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.460]   You know, I have a--
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.420]   I now have a booking agent.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.900]   I have a manager.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.820]   I have a PR person.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:43.460]   Wow.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.020]   So there are people that I am--
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.180]   since you're just subcontracting to various elements.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.820]   And I apologize for poking fire you about it on the scene.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.460]   Yeah, thanks a lot, Tom.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.940]   He's got a posse.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.260]   But yeah, because at a certain point of business
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.540]   was taking over and there's no room left for music.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.500]   If you're an artist, you have to shed the non-artistic stuff,
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500]   eventually.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.820]   But for me, I'm still such a control freak.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:11.220]   And really, the last thing I want to talk is--
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.500]   I don't know anything about that.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.580]   The last thing I would ever farm out to anybody
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.100]   would be responding to people's email.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.940]   Oh, I farmed that out.
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.860]   What do you do?
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.020]   Do you really?
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:24.940]   Well, I do for--
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:25.460]   I have--
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.020]   I just have to answer.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.700]   Hello, internet, Brian.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:32.460]   Thank you for writing to me about something I did.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.660]   Basically, that's basically what I do.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.300]   No, I have a person who answers the radio show email,
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.300]   because it's just too voluminous.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.300]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.340]   And fan mail is tough.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.100]   I mean, you cherish, especially when you work a niche.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.060]   You cherish every one of those people,
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.660]   and you know that each one of them
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.980]   carries a huge amount of weight.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.580]   And yet, they also overwhelm you with demands.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.300]   And it's very difficult.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.460]   I think that's one of the big problems
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.260]   of scaling a niche audience.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.340]   It's very difficult.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:01.780]   It is.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.340]   And I struggle with that every day,
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.340]   because-- and it's not just--
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:09.220]   no, it's sort of easy to respond to an email where they say,
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.620]   oh, I love this song.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.780]   Or thank you for doing this and that.
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.500]   It's wonderful to get those, and it's really easy to write back
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.180]   something to them.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:22.180]   But what's harder is, hey, I love what you're doing.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.940]   I think it's a really interesting business model.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:28.180]   Here's my band.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.860]   Here's a link to my band.
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.780]   And what kinds of stuff do you have in your studio?
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:36.860]   And also, how did you build your store?
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:40.580]   And so it's been, for me, that is the hardest stuff,
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.020]   because it's-- well, actually, a lot of that
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:46.020]   is sort of solvable with facts and something
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:49.100]   like text expander, which I do use.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.100]   But you know--
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:50.580]   It's a question.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.220]   Again, you've come a long way.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.220]   This is really cool.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.460]   Well, thanks to you, Merlin, honestly, really,
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.460]   after you shamed me.
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:57.980]   And then--
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:00.380]   It was very Dr. Phil, I have to admit.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.780]   I did confide.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.460]   We need to get you on Mail template.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:09.060]   Now, Merlin has asked his 43 folders question.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.780]   Now, each of you, I would like you--
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.620]   Ryan, think of an Engadget question.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.860]   Tom, think of a CNET question.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.340]   Veronica, see you on Mahalo question.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.820]   I'm going to ask the Twit question, all right?
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:21.060]   And then I'll let you guys think of each of your particular
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.780]   websites, what you would ask.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.700]   I'm going to ask you, Jonathan, you ever listen to audio books?
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:27.860]   No, I don't.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.860]   Damn it.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.100]   That would have been the best segue.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.140]   It is the best segue, because I'm going to tell you about
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.700]   audiobooksfromaudible.com.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.780]   Ladies and gentlemen, we'll get back with Jonathan Colton
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.060]   and our guests in just a moment.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:44.420]   But first, when's the last time you read a book without falling
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:46.700]   asleep?
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.940]   I really should write a Garrison Keeler
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.700]   kind of commercial for this stuff.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.380]   We talk about Audible a lot.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.020]   Audible is a--
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.500]   Sleep Train.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.260]   Actually, believe it or not, you're close.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.620]   My book of the week is Clue Train.
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:00.860]   But I'm going to talk about that in a second.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.020]   Audible is a place where you can download audiobooks,
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.340]   get them all-- as soon as you think of it, you can get it.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.700]   And it's a great way to get books read without falling asleep
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.260]   before you've turned the page.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.780]   I listen-- all those times when your hands are tied up.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:16.420]   You're in the car.
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.340]   You're at the gym.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.100]   You're working in the garden.
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.540]   You're filming Mahalo Daily.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.820]   And you just can't use your hands.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.740]   You want to listen to an audiobook.
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.540]   That's the-- I'm telling you, it's a lifesaver.
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.820]   If you listen to podcasts, you're halfway there.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.860]   And I do want to recommend a book that's
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.780]   very apropos to this conversation, a book
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.700]   I read many years ago.
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:38.700]   In fact, I gave 20 copies of this book, wasted my money,
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.780]   giving 20 copies of this book to the guys who ran ZD TV.
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.820]   They didn't get it.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.700]   The book is the Clue Train Manifesto,
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.100]   the end of business as usual.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.460]   Did you know I did that, Tom?
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:53.220]   Yeah, because I don't know if I swiped it from one of them.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.220]   I think I gave you one.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.340]   I took from around that same era.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.420]   I think I gave you one.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.460]   Yeah, I gave it to all the management.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:01.180]   Because it talks about markets as conversation.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:03.820]   Now, this book was written 10 years ago.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.820]   And yet, it really was exactly right on about how
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.740]   the internet and is changing commerce, is changing marketing,
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:14.660]   is changing the way we as consumers deal with people
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.740]   who create, like Jonathan.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.780]   It is a must read.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.660]   It is fascinating.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.060]   Doc Searle's Christopher Locke, Rick Levine,
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.420]   and some of the most interesting thinkers in this area
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.620]   kind of wrote it together.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.820]   There is a Clue Train website.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.300]   David Weinberger shouldn't leave him out.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.420]   He's a big part of it.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.460]   There is a Clue Train website.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.180]   But if you haven't read the book, you must.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.820]   And this is a great way to read it.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:36.820]   This is how I read it first.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.580]   And I immediately went out and bought 20 copies of it.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.940]   The Clue Train Manifesto, the end of business as usual.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:42.740]   It's our audible pick.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.060]   Now, the reason we do a pick every week
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.540]   is because if you go to audible.com/twit,
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.660]   a-u-d-i-b-l-e.com/twit.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.540]   And sign up there.
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:55.060]   You get a credit for a free book of the 45,000
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.060]   that they have.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.780]   And this would be a very good one to start with.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.020]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:02.180]   We do thank them for their support of all that this week
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.820]   in tech programs.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:07.420]   Because now, thanks to Jonathan Colton, I'm willing to say,
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.500]   I need your money.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.700]   I want your money.
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.220]   Give me--
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.140]   I did get the books.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:13.580]   Here we go.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.060]   I just looked.
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:14.940]   You signed it.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:15.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:18.140]   It didn't do a damn like a good.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:18.980]   I gave it to you.
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.060]   No, it was excellent.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:20.900]   I loved that book.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.100]   You're the one person who got it.
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.060]   And look what you're doing.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.220]   You're doing great.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:25.940]   But I gave it all the management at Tech TV.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.260]   And of course, I was trying doing my best.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:33.540]   So, Veronica, do you have a Mahalo daily style question
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.300]   for Jonathan Colton?
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.900]   I would like to know about working with John Hodgeman
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:40.660]   on the areas of my expertise and how that happens.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.660]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.180]   I'm a monster.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:42.700]   I love that.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.060]   And I was listening to that audiobook.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:44.620]   I love it.
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:45.820]   Yes, audiobook ever.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.260]   You know, I'd like to recommend that.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:47.940]   What am I thinking?
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.900]   Jonathan's actually on an audiobook.
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:52.540]   But forget everything I said.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.340]   Don't get clue-trained manifesto.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.300]   Get the areas of my expertise we've recommended
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.300]   at many times on the show.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.340]   So that's probably all right.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.580]   But Jonathan, yeah, you're a big part of that.
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:02.420]   Yes.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.540]   Well, John Hodgeman and I have known each other since college.
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:09.140]   And in fact, I met my wife through him.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.180]   And they live just a few blocks away.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.740]   He and his wife lived just a few blocks away.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.980]   And our children are friends.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.540]   And so we've been friends for a long time.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.860]   And we'd work together on this reading series
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:25.700]   that he did called The Little Gray Book Lectures, which
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:30.100]   sort of evolved into this book and into its current status
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.540]   as international superstar.
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:36.060]   And so when he was asked to do an audiobook
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:42.900]   for his almanac of lives, we already
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.820]   had this little--
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.460]   as he called it-- a two-man, one-man show where
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.660]   he would read from the book.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:54.140]   And I would sing songs that I had written about stuff
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:59.660]   in the book while wearing a furry coon skin cap.
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.980]   And so it seemed a very natural thing to take that
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.580]   and make that be the essence of the audiobook.
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:11.020]   And it was all John's brilliant.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:15.100]   Really, he had such a vision for that audiobook.
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.820]   He knew exactly what he wanted it to be,
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.580]   not just him reading from the book,
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:22.580]   because of course it's an almanac, which
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:26.860]   how do you make an audiobook of an almanac is a good question.
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:27.740]   And the answer is--
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.140]   I don't normally recommend people
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:33.060]   listen to the audiobook over reading the book.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.780]   By far, it's been--
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.140]   But in this case, definitely listen to the audiobook.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.140]   By far, it's better.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:39.980]   I don't know what I was thinking when I started this.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:40.940]   It is like--
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.900]   it's a really amusing book.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.300]   But when you think of it-- so if you have read it,
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.220]   almost everybody I know had exactly the same reaction
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.860]   to the book, which was this is incredibly clever
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.140]   and impenetrable.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.420]   And even after like, oh, another table of werewolves.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.700]   OK, this is good.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:57.180]   You need to hear his voice.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.460]   You've got to hear it in the air.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.820]   And then you've got to hear Jonathan's song.
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.300]   You've got to hear about the furry lobster.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:01.300]   It's--
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.900]   It's a real lobster.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:04.820]   Well, John, to his credit points out
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.300]   that the book is not meant to be read through in a sitting,
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:12.500]   particularly the list of 700 hobo names.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.700]   Yeah, that's still available.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.180]   That's still a free MP3, right?
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.420]   It is, yeah.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.940]   People are saying, oh, it's abridged, unaudible.
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.460]   Well, that's the kind of thing they cut out.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.700]   It's not like you're missing.
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.180]   Oh, no, that's intact.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:24.620]   He does it.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.500]   Oh, he does.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.260]   Yeah, one entire disc, I think, is--
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.100]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.180]   Is that recording of us?
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:35.820]   And you played Big Rock Candy Mountain for 50 minutes?
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:36.420]   Is that correct?
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.300]   That's correct, yeah.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.220]   Oh.
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.260]   It was not fun.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.900]   I think you can download that on the internet, can't you?
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.980]   Yeah, I think it might be on his site
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.940]   still on areas of my expertise.com.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.580]   There's an example of giving away something
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.260]   that really has no value.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.100]   Right there.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.500]   So you might as well give it away.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.460]   You might learn about hobo Joe junk pan.
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:59.020]   I mean, that's critical information.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:12:59.980]   Yes, it is.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:03.460]   He in a way, he's talking to the same niche, isn't he?
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.540]   He is, absolutely.
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:08.780]   Yeah, we have huge overlap in our audiences, yeah.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:13.180]   Ryan, you have an gagit.com style question for Joe Co?
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:13.580]   Sure, yeah.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.100]   I got some stuff here.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.540]   First, Jonathan, are you an engaged reader?
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.420]   And yes, there is a right and wrong answer.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.340]   Yes, I'm an avid and gagit reader.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.100]   Oh, nice.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:23.420]   Sweet.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:23.940]   OK.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.100]   Ask about the Zen drum.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.620]   Ask about the Zen drum.
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:27.460]   And drum drum.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.420]   Actually, if I was a music thing, which is actually
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.780]   really amazing music blog that I totally recommend,
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:36.540]   like Tom Whitwell, who does it, used
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.380]   to write a column on a gadget.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:42.780]   But it's basically a blog entirely about really interesting
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:46.100]   and obscure music gear.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:46.740]   I don't know.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.140]   But anyway, now, my question is totally obvious.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.620]   Like, what are the gadgets used?
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.500]   What's your cell phone?
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.300]   What's your DVR?
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.180]   What's your HDTV?
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.620]   Which game consoles do you play if any?
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:57.980]   And so on.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:02.220]   I have a trio 700D.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.340]   Oh, man, I'm sorry.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.380]   I know, right?
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.820]   You're losing street cred.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.220]   I don't know.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.700]   You're allowed to have a Palm device.
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:10.340]   I mean, there are a lot of fanboys out there.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:10.380]   It's a Palm.
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.020]   That's true.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:11.540]   It's cool.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.540]   It's just, you know, I mean, I feel your name.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.060]   One of them back.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:14.860]   It was a man's sentence.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.300]   What's the man's sentence?
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:19.300]   Listen, it made sense when I bought it, OK?
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.380]   And actually, I was happy to have it when I bought it.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.260]   And truth be told, it still does everything I need.
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.940]   It just drives me crazy.
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:26.300]   Good.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.420]   There you go.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.180]   The thermometer went up a little bit there.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.940]   And I can't stand it anymore.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:31.660]   Excellent.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:32.140]   Excellent.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.540]   And that's exactly why it's called "I'm a trio."
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.300]   That's fine.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.220]   I was loved last time.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.620]   Listen, I would love to have an iPhone.
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:43.220]   But I need dial up networking in my life.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:43.900]   Gotcha.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:44.940]   And I keep--
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.980]   That's a turbo geek answer that actually puts you above the threshold.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.740]   So he uses it to access the internet.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:52.260]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:56.060]   And what else?
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.380]   What are other gadgets?
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:02.340]   My HDTV is a Panasonic 50-inch--
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.020]   Yeah, good.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.820]   I can't remember the model.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.300]   Wow.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.140]   I know that's lame that I don't remember the model.
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:08.780]   Oh, no, no.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.980]   I'm out of the club.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:11.780]   2XWZY.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.780]   It's just a bunch of numbers.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:13.220]   Not an--
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.500]   No, that's unfortunately--
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.140]   Unfortunately, I am a Time Warner customer.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:17.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:18.940]   No, there's a lot of pain to your side.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:23.660]   And I have the scientific Atlanta 8,300.
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.020]   Unhackable box.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.020]   HD Pizza Craft, which is not only a terrible user interface,
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:34.100]   but also the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:40.500]   that is supposedly a product for like grandma's and stuff.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.140]   It crashes all the time.
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:46.620]   If you turn it off and turn it on, the HDMI signal
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.700]   doesn't get set right.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.820]   So there's no picture until you turn it off and turn it on.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:53.460]   Again, I have to reboot a couple of times a day.
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:53.900]   It's worse.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.980]   It promises you cake because it has USB ports,
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.140]   firewire ports.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:15:59.820]   I know.
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:02.660]   Ether-- it looks like it does a lot of stuff.
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.300]   If--
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.180]   As long as you're soliciting your audience for music here
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.060]   and there, I would say you know, throw it out there
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:12.380]   and say anybody got a spare Tivo Series 3 or a Tivo H8.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.220]   Trust me, you really want--
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.340]   I've had that box.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.980]   It is a nightmare.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.100]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:22.340]   And if ever there is an argument for why we need competition
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.100]   in a market like that, it's the fact
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.340]   that that device is allowed to exist.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.420]   Because there's just no excuse other than the fact
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:30.660]   that they don't have to change it.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.660]   A device only a cable company could love.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.660]   Oh, God.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:37.180]   I've only talked about gadgets that I hate.
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:39.860]   That's good to show you how my life is.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.780]   No, I think actually says more about the consumer electronics
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.740]   industry.
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:44.300]   Well, that's--
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.300]   And your little of teaching us probably.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.580]   I like that Zen drum, though.
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:48.780]   That's a pretty-- that's a gadget.
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.660]   That's very cool.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.180]   Oh, man.
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.980]   Merlin and I were freaking out over that when you were--
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:52.140]   Oh, man.
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:52.940]   I totally--
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.060]   --for can't you dance.
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.660]   I was on that site today until I got to the price tag.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:57.620]   I was so ready.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:58.860]   I was so ready to buy it.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.660]   I picked a sunburst Zen drum.
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:01.540]   I don't even play an instrument.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.260]   I wanted one.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:02.980]   But you know what?
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:06.180]   I got a feeling you made it look easy.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.980]   Because it was a wonder to watch you play that thing.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:09.780]   It's pretty hard.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.540]   It's pretty hard.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:13.780]   I'm lucky because I actually play the drums.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.580]   For people who don't know, the Zen drum is basically
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:17.580]   the mini trigger device.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.780]   But it's built like an electric guitar.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:25.140]   Sort of this beautifully finished piece of wood
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.460]   with 40 trigger pads in it.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.860]   And I was actually playing that.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:33.940]   That was hooked up to a 12 inch power book that
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:39.060]   was running Ableton Live, which is a sort of loop based
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.300]   composition software.
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:43.780]   And so I was triggering samples with individual pads.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.260]   And it was also, at the same time,
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:49.140]   hooked up to a module called BFD, which
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:53.420]   is a drum, a MIDI drum library, essentially.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:57.540]   So I am able to play the trigger individual drums
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.140]   with individual pads and also to trigger individual samples
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:00.820]   in different ways.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:04.020]   So I can play the drums along with samples
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:07.260]   and do sort of a live remix in the middle of the song.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.540]   It's the only way you could do fancy pants on stage, I'm sure.
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.740]   Well, I mean, it's such a stupid song.
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:13.820]   It's a great song.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.420]   It's the greatest song possibly ever.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.700]   I love fancy pants.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:22.260]   It's a very silly, very small, little tiny thing.
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:27.060]   So having that device elevates it in an important way.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.940]   Well, but it's kind of a Lennon McCartney thing,
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.380]   because you start off so happy.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.700]   You do that Paul McCartney upbeat,
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.060]   ah, the world is great and everything.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.180]   And then it's really depressing.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.580]   And that's like John Lennon's son.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.460]   You're channeling Lennon McCartney on that song.
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.420]   I'm channeling both Lennon and McCartney.
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.340]   It's amazing.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:42.180]   It's amazing.
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.620]   And Ringo, you're playing drums.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:44.180]   And Ringo.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.980]   That's true.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.300]   Really, he's the whole Beatles in there.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:51.220]   I still need to hear what the rest of the gear that
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.180]   makes Jonathan Colton's life go around his.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:55.500]   The rest of the gear, gosh.
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.780]   What else do I really--
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:18:59.380]   What else do I really--
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:18:59.780]   What else do I really--
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.340]   What else do I really--
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.180]   12-inch guy?
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.620]   12-inch guy, but I actually do them all my recording
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:06.860]   on a Mac mini.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:09.100]   Surely you have an iPod or something like it.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:09.900]   I have an iPod.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:10.540]   I have an iPod.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.980]   I have an iPod classic.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:14.900]   Um.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.660]   And I know.
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:17.140]   Look out.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:17.940]   Ooh.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.140]   Look out.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:21.580]   Is it 60, 80, or 160?
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.460]   It is 80.
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.460]   Ooh.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.260]   I don't know why I'm doing that.
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.260]   What do you wear?
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:28.820]   It was so cute.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.060]   You channel a lot of people in the audience, Veronica,
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.300]   who throughout the show on Saturday night, we're going,
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:33.820]   aww.
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:35.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:36.700]   Aww.
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.180]   There's a puppy dog.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:41.180]   There's a puppy dog thing about Joko that the girls just dig.
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:42.780]   It's the jaggy.
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:44.180]   It's the shaggyness.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:44.680]   Aww.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.060]   That makes me non-threatening.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.580]   Aww.
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:48.220]   And what else?
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:54.060]   I record on a Mac mini, and I use Pro Tools LE, and a Digi Design
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.620]   Digi 002.
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:56.700]   Oh, interesting.
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:57.220]   I have a--
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.780]   And the Mac mini is OK with Pro Tools.
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:00.780]   It runs pretty well.
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:01.220]   It is.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.820]   Yeah, it runs great for me.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:06.940]   I mean, it's Pro Tools LE only goes up to 32 tracks, I think.
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:12.620]   And I'm not a huge user of software instruments or serious
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:13.420]   plug-ins.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.900]   I try to keep it pretty bare-bones.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.540]   Yeah, but the 002 has flying faders.
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.460]   That's pretty cool.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.100]   Oh, that's exactly why I bought it.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.020]   That's why I bought it, too.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.700]   I have no use for it, but it's sloppless.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:22.140]   No, I know.
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:24.140]   The faders go up and down automatically.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:25.100]   Mm-hmm.
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:25.820]   See, that calls for--
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:26.820]   Ooh.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:30.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:34.740]   That's sort of my inner circle of gadgetry.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.900]   I think the Zen drum still is the coolest thing.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.260]   I just want that so bad.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.340]   Hey, Merlin, I'll go have C's on one with you.
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:42.180]   I would totally split a Zen drum with you.
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:44.100]   We could split it up like a divorced couple.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.260]   I think, like, alternate Sundays, we could each other.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.500]   Tom Merritt, do you have a Buzz Out Loud or a CNET TV-style
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.500]   quet?
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.500]   Well, you already got to interview Joko.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.620]   Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, at East Beach West Question,
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.820]   I'd probably ask him something about the Electoral College,
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.820]   so that doesn't work.
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:20:59.820]   I mean, I don't know if you're reading it or not.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.820]   You need Roger to channel.
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:03.140]   You could have Roger ask him something about maybe
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:05.220]   F-15 fighters or something.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.220]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:09.900]   But actually, you know, the Buzz Out Loud stuck question,
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:12.100]   because Jonathan is sort of the poster boy for what we talk
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.700]   about when we talk about DRM on that show all the time.
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.540]   Like, I guess what I'd ask, Jonathan, if you were like
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:23.020]   brought into the Ivory Citadel and the RIAA and the FP and the
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.340]   MPAA and everyone were sitting there and they said,
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:28.020]   "Look, we know we've been messing it all up.
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.620]   Tell us, what should we do?"
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.100]   What would you say?
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:36.020]   Well, that's a great question.
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.500]   How would I fix the record industry?
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:38.980]   Yeah, reinvent the record business.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:39.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:40.980]   Just a quick, quick answer to it.
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.620]   And by the way, Joan Rivers is actually coming out now.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.100]   So if you could hurry it up, that'd be great.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.100]   Sure, sure.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.100]   I'll be quick.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:51.260]   First of all, I would say get rid of DRM forever.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.340]   Don't bother.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:58.380]   First and foremost, I would say make the music as
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.820]   available as possible.
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:05.700]   Make it easy to purchase the music in whatever format or
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.860]   whatever channel you can.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:14.980]   And don't fight tooth and nail on percentages, because right
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.780]   now the iTunes store has got you over a barrel, frankly, and
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:20.420]   you're going to have to play ball.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:21.420]   Do you sell stuff on iTunes?
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.420]   You don't.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.860]   I do, but it's through CD Baby.
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.060]   Right, right, right.
[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.620]   They actually do digital distribution to a number of
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:29.620]   different ways.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.500]   So for those of you who would like copy protected versions of
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.260]   Jonathan's songs.
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.060]   Yes.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:38.260]   You can go to the iTunes store, but you can also get them from
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.900]   the Amazon MP3 store.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:46.420]   I think they've already heard the message about DRM.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:50.380]   I would also say that file sharing is not the enemy.
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:54.180]   And I really can't say this strongly enough.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.740]   It benefits all artists.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:01.740]   I don't care how big or small they are to have their music
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:05.580]   floating around and shareable.
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:10.060]   And really saving the industry is not something that we need
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.620]   to worry about, because there's still going to be an
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.620]   industry there.
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.180]   It's going to be different.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:19.460]   And they're not going to command the same deal making
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.260]   power that they had before.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:23.980]   They're not going to be able to get a larger percentage of
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:24.580]   everything.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.820]   And they're not going to be able to spend as much on
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.220]   recordings and marketing.
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:34.660]   And instead, we're going to move to something where what used
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:39.540]   to be a record label is now a sort of conglomerate of
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.580]   services that independent musicians can buy.
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.140]   I like that.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.220]   And it's already happening.
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:49.020]   I mean, you look at something like network records and
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.300]   what Terry McBride is doing.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.300]   It's this sort of package of services.
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:54.300]   And what sort of deal do you want to make with it?
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.260]   Do you want to do distribution only?
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:58.540]   Or do you want to do a classic label deal?
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.260]   Do you want to manager?
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.060]   What do you need?
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.180]   He's very smart.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.380]   It does bare-necked ladies.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:06.660]   They have a lot of big Canadian bands.
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.020]   Yeah, and there's still need for those services.
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:10.900]   I need those services.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:17.500]   And so it's just that the old model is dead.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.380]   And a lot of jobs are going to be lost.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.660]   And there's going to be a lot of pain in that industry
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:26.100]   until the shake-up is over.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:28.060]   It's been so great having you on the show, Jonathan.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.100]   I really appreciate it.
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.540]   Well, thank you so much.
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:35.500]   Nothing is better than having four people blow smoke up
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:35.860]   your ass.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:37.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:37.900]   Five.
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:38.660]   I think it was five.
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:39.180]   About five.
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:39.740]   Oh, fantastic.
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:41.260]   I just even lost count.
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:41.980]   No, I don't--
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.340]   Smoke gets hard to keep track.
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.700]   That's how decadent it is in here.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:46.220]   Would you mind?
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:47.500]   I guess I don't have to ask you.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.580]   I could just play it and let Valve sue me.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:53.140]   I might play still alive as we head out on this one.
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:53.700]   Absolutely.
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.820]   What a great song it was.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:57.580]   And I want to thank the members of the band,
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:02.940]   Veronica Belmont, from Halle Daily, M-A-H-A-L-O.com.
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.060]   What a great daily show that is.
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.300]   It's getting better all the time.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.500]   You do such a good job.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.380]   And Chris, your camera guy, did some great video.
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.700]   If you want to see us perform on the stage of the Great American
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.460]   Music Hall, that's on your--
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.260]   I wouldn't exactly call him my camera guy,
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.460]   but he did an excellent job.
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:16.900]   Hey, camera guy.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:18.060]   A guy with a camera.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.460]   A wonderful guy for choice.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.540]   You could also call him the editor in chief of joystick,
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:22.660]   which is one of the most--
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.260]   game technology sites out.
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.260]   But you know, camera guy works too.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.060]   Oh, that.
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.100]   Oh, it's words, yeah.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.780]   Oh, that.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:31.420]   You can catch that on Veronica's blog.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.500]   It's on YouTube now.
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.460]   I have it on my blog.
[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:36.580]   In fact, it's going to take over the world, I believe.
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:37.980]   And when is the DVD?
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:40.580]   Do you know-- do you have any kind of ETA for a DVD, Jonathan,
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.260]   of that concert?
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:41.780]   Because--
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:44.100]   You know, we have to search through what we have.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:48.100]   And we also asked fans to record the show and send us the footage.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:48.580]   That's right.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.380]   So it's going to take a while to through it.
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:53.300]   I wouldn't expect it will have anything before a few months
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:53.580]   from now.
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:56.140]   Can I just ask you, will you include our performance
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:56.700]   in the DVD?
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.980]   Or maybe that'll be a special feature.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.420]   It could be an Easter egg.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.540]   No, it'll be on the DVD.
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.100]   Oh, thank god.
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:02.620]   You kidding me?
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.620]   Oh, man.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.060]   Is there any way, any way at all we can talk you out of that?
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.380]   I think it's a bit Easter egg.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:12.260]   I want to give you money, Jonathan.
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:15.020]   Ivy, it may not be in the flow of the show.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:15.740]   I don't know.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.540]   We have to see.
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:17.900]   It'll definitely be on the DVD.
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:18.540]   It's definitely not.
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.540]   It's not in the flow of anything.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:22.500]   Well--
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.100]   Although, I love it because you reach up,
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.460]   you pull down a screen, which is hysterical.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.060]   And the crowd starts to go a little wild.
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:31.100]   They kind of have a feeling what's going on here.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:32.660]   It was great.
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:33.540]   It was a wonderful moment.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.300]   It was really fun.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.180]   Ryan Block is the editor in chief of Engadget.
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.580]   And always great having you on.
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:40.900]   Thank you so much, Ryan.
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:42.420]   Thanks, I really appreciate it.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.340]   MerlinMan43Folders.com.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:47.180]   And of course, a regular on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:48.780]   You're the man, Merlin.
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:49.420]   Thanks for having me.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:53.620]   There's nobody I'd rather have and play drums behind me.
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.180]   I'm just happy to be in the shadow of you.
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.420]   A very large hat.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.940]   I have a very adorable picture of the two of you, by the way,
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:00.780]   from that evening.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.900]   I saw that also.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.260]   Yeah, I saw that also.
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.620]   I thought what happened in the tenderloin.
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.580]   Very tender.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.260]   It's a tenderness in the tenderloin.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:12.340]   It's a special moment between the two of us I admit.
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:15.620]   Tom Merritt at Buzz Out Loud and CNET TV.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.660]   And your interview with Jonathan Colton
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:20.340]   is on cnettv.com still.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:22.140]   Yeah, it's actually clipped out.
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:23.820]   You can watch the whole episode of CNET Live,
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:27.260]   or you can just go right to the Jonathan Colton interview,
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:30.060]   which Jonathan actually very kindly linked to from his blog.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:30.580]   Good.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.940]   Jonathan's blog is Jonathan Colton.com, C-O-U-L-T-O.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:35.420]   And you can also get all of his songs there.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.220]   I highly recommend the $70 complete set,
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:41.180]   because you just don't want to miss one song.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.060]   Not one song.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:44.660]   And by the way, if you're still alive, doesn't come on that.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.780]   But you could just start your recorders now, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:50.700]   because we're going to be listening to that as we go out.
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:54.100]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:57.900]   This was a triumph.
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:02.940]   I'm making a note here, huge success.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:10.020]   It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:19.100]   At Bet Your Science, we do what we must, because we can.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:24.660]   For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:28.660]   But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.660]   You just keep on trying till you run above cake.
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:36.100]   And the science gets done and you make a need.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:39.660]   Come to the people who are still alive.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:47.660]   I'm not even angry.
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:53.460]   I'm eating so sincere right now.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:29:01.460]   Even though you broke my heart and killed me,
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:05.460]   I'm 20 to pieces,
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:10.460]   and two every piece in truth of time.
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:16.460]   Does they burn, be heard, because I'm so happy for you?
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.460]   Now these points of data make a beautiful line
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:22.460]   when we're out of beta.
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:24.460]   We're releasing on time.
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:28.460]   So I'm rather not burned in all of the things we learned
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:32.460]   where the people who are still alive.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:41.460]   Go ahead and leave me.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.460]   I think I prefer to stay inside.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:52.460]   Maybe you'll find someone else who helped you.
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:59.460]   Maybe back when we saw that was a joke.
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.460]   A half a chance.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:05.460]   Anyway, this cake is great.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:08.460]   It's so delicious and moist.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:12.460]   Look at me still talking when the science can do.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:16.460]   When I look up, everything's me glad I'm not.
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:18.460]   I've experienced a lot.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:24.460]   There is research to be done when the people who are still alive.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:28.460]   Then you leave me, I lie still alive.
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:32.460]   I'm doing science and I'm still alive.
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:36.460]   I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:40.460]   While you're dying, I'll be still alive.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:44.460]   And when you're dead, I will be still alive.
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.460]   Still alive.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.460]   Still alive.
