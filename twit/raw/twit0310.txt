[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.880]   from all over the world.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   Well, at least from all over California.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.340]   Great.
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.560]   A great Twit panel, starting with Denise Howell
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.680]   from Southern California, where she has survived.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.480]   Karma Geddon.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.980]   Yes.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.000]   Live to tell the tale.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.600]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.120]   Hey, Denise, our host from this weekend law,
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.160]   blogger at bagandbagage.com, illegal, and a great podcaster
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.600]   and blogger.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.040]   So nice to have you back, Denise.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.760]   Great to be here again.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.000]   So what-- well, actually, Jenny's also here.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.480]   So I think Jenny was also a survivor, right, of Karma Geddon.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.200]   So far I've survived, yes.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.040]   Jenny Jardan is here from boingboing.net.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.520]   Great to have you on the show again, once again.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.240]   Great to be here.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.680]   And from Northern California, Gina Smith, editor-in-chief
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.440]   of the brand new newly-launched bike magazine.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.520]   Hi, Gina.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.320]   Oh, hi, Leo.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.840]   Great to have you here.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.840]   And what great timing.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.320]   Yes.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.280]   You launched this week, right?
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.320]   Yes, we launched on July 11 with no fanfare whatsoever.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.560]   We just put the sign up.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.640]   BYTE.com, right?
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.140]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.520]   Doesn't that say something about the times
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.360]   that we have to spell bite?
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.040]   Maybe it does.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.720]   Maybe it does.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's a good point.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.280]   I was talking to Linda of Linda.com.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.480]   Yesterday.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.440]   And she said, does everybody know it's with a Y?
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.840]   I said, well, everybody I know knows it's with a Y,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.440]   but maybe we better spell it on the radio show.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.040]   We've got a lot of folks that are on our staff.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.680]   We've got a staff of about 70 people, all of whom-- Leo,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.600]   I swear to god, all of whom came from Twit.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   Good.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.280]   Isn't that funny?
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.120]   You're getting good people.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.480]   These are my staff.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.840]   You're getting good people.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.560]   This is the last--
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.480]   But there are a number of them in their 20s and their 30s,
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.160]   early 30s.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.360]   So they wouldn't remember?
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.440]   They wouldn't remember.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.400]   They don't remember seeing it themselves.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.080]   But you know what?
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.960]   Look at this.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.160]   I don't remember the Beatles, right?
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.400]   But I know the Beatles.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.840]   I know every song on the White Out Fund.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   What do you mean you don't remember the Beatles?
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.920]   I mean, I--
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.520]   You weren't alive when the Beatles were making music?
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.200]   I was born the year they broke up.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.560]   I feel so old.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.920]   You're not a old female.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.760]   You're forever young.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   You're definitely older than Eugene.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.600]   You're a fan.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.240]   Denise and I remember the Beatles.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.240]   You said you did.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.680]   But my point is that people remember
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.560]   bite because it's one of those brands that just was legendary.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.080]   Absolutely.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.320]   And you know, Jerry Pournell, those great--
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.720]   We've got him back.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.160]   --coverers.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.600]   Yeah, I mean, it's just very exciting.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.880]   You've got the tinny covers back, too.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.120]   We've got Robert Tinney back.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.760]   Not just the covers, but the actual man.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.520]   It's nice to have a guy if you're going to have his covers.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.760]   Yes, he draws them.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.240]   Yes, he draws the covers.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.480]   And we've got all the--
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.160]   we've got a piece on bite.com that was the original.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.800]   Letter from the Editor-in-Chief in 1975.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.520]   And I didn't know how to find this guy,
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.040]   because I wanted to check with him.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.840]   Is it OK if I run your letter from 1975?
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.000]   Never could find him.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.520]   He emailed me on Tuesday and said, wow,
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.320]   bite's back.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.280]   Thanks for using my letter.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.480]   You can use everything I wrote.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.760]   That's so cool.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.640]   What's his name?
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.040]   Carl Helmers.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.440]   Oh, yeah, Carl Helmers.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.520]   Yeah, if you get a bite.com, you can see there's
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.640]   a thing along the carousel called Bite 1975.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.120]   And under that, you can see full text.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.760]   BYT.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.880]   And it's full article.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.560]   And it's full Mac team.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.720]   Speaking of-- wow, sounds like Karma Geddon's
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.320]   happening somewhere in there.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.120]   Speaking of music and the Beatles,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.160]   Spotify launched this week in the US.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.360]   Any Spotify users?
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.560]   I got my invite.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.480]   Any of you using it?
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.920]   Jenny, Denise, what do you think, Jenny?
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.800]   How do you like Spotify?
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.320]   I'm digging it.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   By the way, sorry.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.160]   It's probably me.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.400]   There are copters and planes overhead.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.840]   Karma Geddon is still underway here in Los Angeles.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.240]   You know, I was preempted-- the Los Angeles radio station
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   that I'm on preempted me yesterday--
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.400]   for wall-to-wall coverage of nothing, right?
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.720]   Nothing happened.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.320]   One of our friends on "Boring Boring"
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.960]   made it up there to the 405 with a police escort
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.480]   and sent back a bunch of pictures.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.720]   You just basically described walking along
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.160]   a completely empty, huge freeway.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.680]   Wow.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.520]   This is like the most boring, dull thing I've ever
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.760]   been this excited about.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.800]   Walking along in a freeway ramp with cops.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.520]   I have my whole life, though, had a fantasy of them shutting
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.840]   down freeways and getting to bicycle on freeways,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.600]   because they're so smooth and nice and weird.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.480]   Yeah, I heard of people scooting up there
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.160]   with skateboards and bikes illicitly.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.920]   And I'm afraid I didn't have the co-honest.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.880]   Do you have the--
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   They would arrest you if you--
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.320]   That's kind of how it works.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.040]   But, yes, bottom line.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.300]   I don't know.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.600]   It is Southern California, Leah.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.760]   We love our skateboarders.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.400]   I love Jenny's caramel get-in posting.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.440]   That's so much more fun.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.320]   I wish it were caramel get-in.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.200]   So we should explain for those tiny percentage
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.400]   of the audience who has not plugged into Los Angeles news.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.120]   Los Angeles has become the New York of the media world now.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.480]   If it happens in Los Angeles, it's global news.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.440]   They closed a freeway, the 405--
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.600]   Well, they were going to close it 53 hours
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   for a bridge demolition.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.920]   They reopened-- I think they reopened early, yes?
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.440]   They did 15 hours early, as I understand it.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.640]   And LA is such a car culture that just terror
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.320]   rained in the city.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   That this was going to-- everybody was just going to die,
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.040]   because you couldn't drive on the 405 on a Saturday.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.320]   You mean, I have to use Sepulveda Boulevard?
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.440]   And then, so what would it was supposed to be a disaster,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.640]   too?
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.320]   They actually called Eric Astrada out of retirement
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.720]   to give public service announcements.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.800]   The Chip Sky?
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.160]   The Chip Sky, yeah.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.480]   All right, it's Eric Astrada.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.120]   You may remember me from Chip's.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.440]   Don't drive on the--
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.720]   That was one good looking guy.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.840]   Is he still good looking?
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.760]   He holds up well.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.260]   Did he?
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.440]   He does hold up well.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.400]   Oh, good.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.520]   So needless to say, it's over now.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.800]   There are helicopters overhead.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.000]   It was way over covered, because it's LA.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And if you go to the markets locally,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.080]   I just did my Sunday grocery shopping.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.400]   And I saw signs for Rainier Cherries,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.840]   Carmageddon Special, $2 a pound.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.840]   It was in the local Japanese market
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.160]   where I go to get my mushrooms and my melons and things.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.600]   It reminds me of Y2K, to be honest.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.600]   A big--
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.320]   So I like that.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.520]   Much to do about nothing.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:00.880]   And it--
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.280]   Well, I think the media had too much advanced notice.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.120]   We've been hearing about this for weeks, right?
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.480]   So they were all built up.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.240]   I was in what was a much more Carmageddon-esque situation
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.600]   on an impromptu basis recently out on the '91 freeway,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.240]   another big artery, where there was a U-Haul by the side
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.600]   of the road in a parking lot.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.920]   And it had something mysterious about it.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.880]   The bomb squad was called out.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.800]   The freeway was blocked for about five miles.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.920]   And I did see-- now, this freeway was full of cars blocked.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.440]   I did see a skateboarder get out.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.480]   And it was a nice downhill slope.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.200]   And he just completely coasted past
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.320]   all the traffic.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.520]   I don't know how he got back to his car.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.080]   Only in LA.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.320]   Only in LA.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.200]   Only in LA.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.840]   I wish I lived in LA.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.320]   Well--
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.720]   Where it was sunny and nice.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.560]   But you know, you were talking about Spotify.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.480]   It just occurred to me.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.640]   If you don't have an invite, you can go to cloud.com,
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.280]   cloudwithk, k-l-o-u-t.com.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.200]   And there's an area on that site called Perks
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.280]   that will let you get on to Spotify in the US
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.600]   without somebody inviting you.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.400]   And I only know that because one of my writers
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.320]   that's a fight, because it's not such a closed invite
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.040]   that you can't--
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.960]   Oh, Malek had something like 28,000 invites
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.040]   that he was giving away.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.560]   So--
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.080]   It was very had a bunch.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.200]   What do you think, Jenny?
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.680]   I mean, I've been using audio, Rhapsody, Napster,
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.760]   and Mog in the US for years.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.200]   Is it so different?
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.800]   For me, it's a toss up between audio and Spotify.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.160]   But I was a long time iTunes devotee,
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.080]   despite the fact that iTunes had so many limitations.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.240]   And I don't think I'm ever going back.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880]   From iTunes or--
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.320]   I think it's either going to be audio or Spotify.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.120]   Spotify has some clergy UI issues that annoy me.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.440]   But one thing that I like is that the catalog is really,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:50.960]   really deep.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.480]   I tend to go for obscurities.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.760]   And I'm impressed.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:02.000]   All of the vinyl intelligence tests that I ran by it passed.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.480]   Yeah, that's actually of interest.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.400]   They claim 18 million songs, right?
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.480]   Huge.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.280]   That seems awfully large.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.600]   I like-- and I think this is key.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.160]   And audio does this, but I think Spotify does it very well.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.560]   This is the desktop client, by the way.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.920]   It immediately, if you log into your Facebook account,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.320]   populates your Facebook friends and their playlists.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.680]   And while it's just limited to Facebook, which I think
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.080]   is a negative, it is kind of nice that I could see all
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.760]   of this music suggestion stuff just kind of instantly.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.640]   It's instantly superior to what iTunes tried to do with paying.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.720]   Oh, gosh, yeah.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.080]   I think it's so true.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.560]   That's one of the more conspicuous failures
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.760]   in terms of Apple launches.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.480]   It just never really got better.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.680]   And in my opinion, you kept getting worse the longer
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680]   it was out there.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.400]   But Spotify, the fact that it integrates with something
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.160]   as popular as Facebook--
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.920]   I'm not a Facebook user.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.800]   But you're at least tapping into an established platform
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.920]   where there's a really large user base that's already
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.560]   used to sort of prolifically sharing.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.760]   Be nice if it did support Twitter, Google Plus,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.280]   some other social networks.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.600]   I haven't linked mine up to Facebook yet.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.000]   What do you get from that?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.560]   I mean, do you actually get music suggestions?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.000]   Or do you see people's Facebook status updates?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.560]   No, no, you don't get status updates.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.480]   So it's on the right Denise of the screen right now.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.520]   And so these are Facebook friends who have Spotify,
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.360]   only friends who have Spotify.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.840]   And so let me click on somebody like Cedric Ingrand,
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.120]   who's French, so he's had Spotify for some time.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.440]   It immediately populates it with his public playlists.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.160]   That's Hall.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.960]   Not Facebook updates, not crap.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.440]   Just the music that he has published.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.720]   Don McAllister, he's from the UK,
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   and has some pretty bad taste.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.800]   But now I know.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.720]   He loves easy top, well-dressed man.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.520]   OK, actually, definitely.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.760]   But I'll show you one other thing that really impresses me
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.920]   about Spotify.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.600]   I'll pick a song, any song.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.400]   Double-click it, it starts playing immediately, actually.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   Love that.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   That's kind of stunning.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.640]   That it's immediate.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.400]   I don't know how they do it.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.760]   But that, by itself, is a huge leap ahead of other music
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.360]   systems.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:08.840]   It's true.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.200]   Also, the memory footprint, if you're on a tablet,
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.840]   if you're on something like a MacBook Air, a netbook,
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.400]   you're not talking about an app that's
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.720]   going to hog so much of the spare memory that you have.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   Right.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.200]   Right.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.840]   What do you think, Denise?
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.880]   You like it?
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.360]   Well, like I said, I hadn't licked it up to Facebook yet.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.720]   So when I logged in, there just wasn't much there.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.480]   And maybe I'm just too many good options out there for us now.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.760]   And I'm a couple of years past being blown away by this,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.680]   which I probably would have been if they'd come a bit earlier
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.040]   to the US.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.640]   But now, I mean, they're just with the cloud services out there.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.000]   And I have not abandoned iTunes, although it's not my go-to.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.520]   I do like--
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.080]   It's so horrible.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.120]   It's just so bad.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.120]   It's an embarrassment to Apple.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.160]   iTunes.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.360]   I agree.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.560]   Well, certainly iTunes plus ping is an embarrassment to Apple.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.520]   There's no questions about that.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.200]   And what's interesting about Spotify
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.240]   is it's this unlimited stream.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.680]   It's basically ad-free if you spring for the $5, right?
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.160]   And like you guys said--
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.600]   I think they're not going to limit the free one, even,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.760]   which they do it for the year.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.240]   Not yet.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   Right?
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.400]   They did not for this year.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.880]   So in Europe, you can only listen to 20.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.080]   I think 20--
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.040]   I can remember what it is-- 20 songs a day or something
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.880]   like that.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.480]   Yeah, but here they haven't put any kind of a cap on it,
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.040]   which is really exciting.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.800]   And what you said about finding really
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.360]   unlistened to or unplayed on the radio songs.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.480]   We had Jacob Lopez, who is in his mid-20s.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.520]   And he said, finally, I can listen to Zombina and the skeletons.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.880]   Oh, finally.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.720]   I said, finally.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.480]   That's amazing.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:48.960]   Finally.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.600]   I'm beanie.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.480]   I have the skeletons and its courtesy of Spotify.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.120]   Now, artists are going to raise this point,
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.280]   which is that it's very hard to make any money from Spotify.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.960]   I've heard it.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.480]   And it doesn't-- it's basically promotional value only.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.680]   So are we ripping off artists by supporting services like this?
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.400]   Should we be buying music from iTunes or Amazon?
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   Wouldn't that be a better way to support an artist you really
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:17.720]   like?
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.320]   Because it's so easy for $10 a month.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.120]   I can listen to all the Zombini I want.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.120]   Zombina.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.640]   Zombina.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.680]   Pardon me.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.040]   And they get pennies.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.000]   I mean, they literally, they get almost nothing.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.520]   Well, Spotify is tightly integrated with the record labels,
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:32.840]   right?
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.240]   They're the driving force behind having this service out there.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.160]   It's their bid to compete in the modern digital world.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.040]   And I think they'd probably argue to the artists
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.080]   that it's the equivalent of radio airplay these days.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:48.860]   Exactly.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.880]   Because radio's not doing it anymore.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.520]   That's what I think.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.020]   Right?
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.240]   So you got to do something.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   How do we promote this?
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.360]   I mean, that's aspirational.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.600]   It's so nice to say, let's be for the artists.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.520]   And we don't care.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:01.680]   But in the end--
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.120]   We know how much the record labels love the artists.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.040]   That's exactly the point.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.040]   I think it's an exciting announcement.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.280]   There was that great infographic, which we talked about a few
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.920]   tweets ago about how much money this is from--
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.800]   information is beautiful.net--
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.360]   how much money artists earn online for a solo artist
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.520]   to earn a monthly minimum wage in the US, which they estimate
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.960]   to be about $1,160.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:35.840]   They have to sell 143 self-pressed CDs, 155 CDs on CD, baby,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.680]   1,161 record deal CDs.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.720]   Album downloads from, say, iTunes,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.360]   1,229 MP3 downloads.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.840]   The dot is growing.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.080]   Here's how much?
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:50.600]   Wow.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.760]   You have to have 849,000 plays on Rhapsody.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.200]   You have to have 1.5 million plays on Last FM.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.040]   There's no room for the spot.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.960]   Spotify, at least this is the deal that they had.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.640]   I don't know if this is the deal going forward.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.200]   4 million plays per month to earn a minimum wage.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.240]   But Leo, you remember this.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.400]   You and I wrote a book together.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.840]   And certainly my latest book just came out.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.560]   This is very similar to what authors face so much.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.000]   We make diddly-doo do.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.080]   I was going to say another word.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.800]   Remember you and I figured it out?
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.280]   What is this per hour?
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.760]   No, it was like we were working for $0.10 an hour
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.960]   to create that book.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.800]   And the reason you do a book, at least in the computer
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.000]   industry, is that promotional thing.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.040]   It raises your name.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.560]   That's right.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.040]   And then you could do speaking engagements.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.480]   And you can get on all things considered or whatever.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.640]   I mean, it helps your profile.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.080]   You don't do it for the money.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.920]   No, you don't write up for the money.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.720]   So maybe you do Spotify for the profile, not for the money.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.240]   If you're an artist, I mean, you'd be real psyched to be on--
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.600]   if you're Zombina, for instance, I'd never
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   heard their names on the screen.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.920]   Zombina's really happy that we've now
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.000]   mentioned them three times on this show.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.960]   Exactly.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.240]   They've got to be psyched.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.600]   And they're on Spotify.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.080]   Right.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.320]   Were it not for Spotify?
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.520]   None of us would have the names on Bina on our lips.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.680]   Should I play?
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.180]   We'll see.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.720]   This is sad, because I can't play a spot.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.240]   I can't play a spot.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.320]   Could you go back to playing the Z-top track?
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.160]   Say again?
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.660]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.480]   Look at this word ZZ.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.480]   Back to ZZtop.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.680]   Forget the Zombina.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.480]   It's so much easier.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.000]   Sorry, Jacob.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.720]   It's all in there.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.080]   No, I'm going to search for Zombina.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:23.560]   Let me see.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.160]   Z-O-M-B-I-N-A.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.560]   You know what the ZZ and ZZtop stands for?
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.200]   No, what?
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.000]   No.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.040]   Zombina, Zombina.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.480]   Look, there's tons of Zombina and the skeletons.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.360]   That's what Jacob says.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.360]   They must be good.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.080]   Let's play there.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.880]   I can sort by popularity, by the way.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.120]   So I know that their number one song is nobody
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.200]   likes you when you're dead.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.800]   Let's do it.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.300]   They do.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.440]   All right, that's enough.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.680]   That's all I could play according to you.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.280]   OK.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.440]   That's my--
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.360]   My attorney is here.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.960]   Is that OK?
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.680]   Did I play too much?
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.240]   Well, since we're engaged in commentary and news-gathering,
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.360]   informational activity, I think we're cool.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:03.880]   Fairies.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.400]   Fairies.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:04.680]   Fairies.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.240]   I'd just like to add one more thing.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.920]   The dilemma that you're talking about
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.160]   is a little bit like what we blogs go through when new and elegant
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.960]   apps like Flipboard come out.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.960]   Flipboard is something that I've spent many an evening
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.920]   on the couch flipping through.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.000]   And I've just found out that Boing Boing and our Flickr
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.080]   pool are going to be featured in a really nice way
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.000]   at the front door of the app.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.600]   And we love that.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.440]   But--
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.040]   We see no revenue from it.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.320]   They start down our ads.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:33.840]   Right.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   And we're talking to them.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.480]   And they have our consent to do what they're
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.040]   doing for the time being.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.800]   But the idea that they're presenting this,
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.400]   and they're presumably-- eventually, they're
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.840]   going to be adding their own ads in and giving us
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.000]   whatever terms they feel like after they've
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.960]   built up their user base.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.040]   It feels like, on the one hand, we always want more users.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.640]   We always want new audiences to know about us
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.280]   and be exposed to our content.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.000]   But on the other hand, it kind of feels like we're
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.600]   being taken for a ride.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   I totally agree with that thinking.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.880]   I mean, that is how it feels for people.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.080]   It's like when my book was picked up,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.680]   this was the Wozniak biography, and it was picked up
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.080]   by the Kindle.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.240]   I mean, I don't see any money from that.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.800]   And I was just a bird.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.160]   Well, that's you just had a bad deal.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.360]   I mean, you should have royalties for the Kindle sales.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:22.960]   Yeah, OK.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.120]   But even if I had a deal, I mean, you know how this works.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.840]   The agent takes it, the publisher takes it, everybody
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.360]   takes it.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.680]   It takes forever to get your money back on the advance
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.080]   and the end.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.280]   You get pennies.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.440]   And yet, Flipboard is such a really generative, wonderful idea
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.520]   that makes content so palatable.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.680]   That's a great way to read Boing Boing.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.280]   I love it.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.560]   I love the way it looks.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.920]   It is to internet content, what Spotify is to music.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.280]   Spotify is so much-- and audio.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.800]   Even with the difficulties that they have,
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.880]   even with the UI problems that those two apps have,
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.040]   they're so much better than anything else that's out there
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.640]   in a big way.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.400]   I think for other apps--
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.720]   for other apps that do this like Zite, who--
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.080]   people are suing them because they're not reaching out
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.040]   as Flipboard has.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.360]   I think Flipboard realized they had
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.640]   to reach out to the content creators.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.560]   So you're satisfied from a point of view of Boing Boing.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.840]   You're satisfied that they're going to take care of you?
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.680]   Or--
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   Hmm.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.520]   I think that's being a little too optimistic.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.120]   We're happy to be featured.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.400]   We like what they're doing with our content right now.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.280]   And I think I'm safe in saying that we have kind of a wait
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.960]   and see attitude, but that we're impressed with what
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.280]   I just look in platform and is.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.280]   And you can, by the way, I think Flipboard does give you away
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.320]   as a content creator to block it.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:42.880]   Oh, sure.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.240]   Well, we chose not to do that.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.640]   Yeah, you would want to do that.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.560]   So everything that we release is released
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.480]   under a Creative Commons license that permits
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.840]   non-commercial reuse with attribution.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.680]   And for the time being, they're not selling ads
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.480]   against our content.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.800]   So it's not a violation.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.480]   Plus, we're talking with them and they have our consent.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.160]   But it'll be interesting to see how they
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.720]   businessify what they do.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.040]   Well, and I share your concern.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.800]   I mean, they're not doing it with podcasts at this point,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.040]   but I'd have the same problem if--
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.400]   but that's why we embed our ads.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.280]   So we knit them so tightly into the content that you can't--
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.200]   You're very smart.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.000]   You can't get rid of them.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.520]   It's like watermarking.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.120]   Yeah, if you want the show, you're going to get the ad.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.800]   Speaking of which, let's take a break and come back.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.280]   You know, I want to talk about Netflix, because that's really
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.680]   raised a fewer.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.880]   And with their-- what some say is a price increase.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.120]   I might dispute that.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.320]   But let's talk about it in just a second.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.400]   Before we do, though, I do want to talk about our friends
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.560]   at Citrix who make a great product for the IT professional.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.560]   If you're doing support, software support, IT support,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.520]   maybe just mom and dad, grandma, and grandpa support,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.760]   you've got to know about GoToAssist Express.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.240]   I've been using it since they were called Expert City,
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.680]   which was 10 years ago during the Tech TV days.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.920]   This is the greatest thing ever.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.840]   And Citrix, they know how to do remote access, 128-bit SSL.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.600]   It's cross-platform Mac or PC.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.720]   And they've added features that support pros need.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.040]   Unattended support, really important.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.480]   Very easy for your support.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.840]   You don't want to spend time supporting the support tool.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.040]   So all you have to do is send them a link in an email.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.360]   If you're in a chat, you give them a link.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.280]   This is what I did to my mom.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.280]   She clicks the link.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.080]   It's a Java stub, very quick to load.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.400]   You say, mom, just click Allow when you see the Allow.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.840]   She says, and then I'm in.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.960]   And I'm fixing her computer.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.880]   And she loves it, because she can see the mouse move around.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.720]   I can chat with her.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.920]   I can explain what I'm doing.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.640]   It is the way to speed things up.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.760]   Eight sessions at once.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.280]   It's a proposal like that, because you
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.160]   could start a scan or an install and move along.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.480]   So you don't have to wait for it to finish.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.080]   It gives you an assay of the operating system,
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.520]   all the software running in the background,
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.440]   including security software.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.840]   You can share your screen with them,
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.960]   as well as look at their screen.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.160]   I could just go on and on.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.720]   But you know the best thing to do is try it free.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:57.000]   Go to their website, go to assist.com/twit.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.840]   G-O-T-O-Assist.com/twit.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.600]   And you have 30 days absolutely free to try this,
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.880]   and all of the great features.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.320]   Citrix has really put together the best remote support app.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.600]   I know there are other choices out there.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.960]   But there's no reason not to try this.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.440]   It's free, and I'm-- except that I should warn you,
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.320]   you're going to get hooked.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:16.880]   It's the best.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.320]   Go to assist express.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.360]   Go to assist.com/twit.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.720]   Thank you for supporting Twit.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.240]   And you see I knitted that so carefully into the body of it,
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.360]   that nobody will be able to extricate it.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.120]   We also are Creative Commons' attribution
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.160]   share-like non-commercial.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.600]   I think that's the right way to do content.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.720]   Jenny, I'm curious about Flipboard.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.800]   Do you see any sort of value add coming back from them?
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.880]   Did they give you any more sort of detailed statistics
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.240]   than you could get otherwise just by someone using a browser?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040]   No.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.200]   So you're doing it on faith, basically,
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.680]   that it's going to build business?
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.160]   I mean, I think with things like that that come into the marketplace
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.560]   and look attractive or look interesting,
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.040]   we sometimes like to cautiously tread forward
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.280]   and see what happens with that.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.000]   And then if it-- you know, if some time goes by,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.520]   the product matures and we're not getting anything out of it,
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.920]   or it's potentially leaching traffic away
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.960]   or leaching revenue away, then we opt out.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.480]   But it's going to be hard to turn it off.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.560]   I mean, you're going to have some irate people if you turn it off.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.000]   I mean, I read "Boying-Boying" that way.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I hate to admit it.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.440]   Should I not-- would you like to send a message out to me
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.080]   and other "Boying-Boying" fans that it would be better
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.440]   to go to the website?
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:37.120]   Boy, if you go to the website, you will find a tablet
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.360]   and I've had friendly experience that will also pay our bills.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.200]   Right on.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.200]   Awesome.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.960]   That's, by the way, we're doing our web design,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.720]   and I spent quite a bit of extra money
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.600]   to make sure that it was HTML5, tablet compliant, iOS compliant,
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.960]   because that's nowadays you got to.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.560]   When we did our design last year, that's specifically
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.040]   why the design looks the way it does.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.040]   You don't have to download an app to look at one of my pad.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.480]   It just works.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.800]   I don't like the amplification, frankly, of the web.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.880]   I don't like it.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.280]   Gina, what are you doing with byte?
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.840]   Are they-- how are you handling this?
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.400]   Well, we've got an iPad app that came out the same day
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.280]   that byte came out on-- well, maybe a day after, on July 12.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.200]   But right now, we're just doing streaming only.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   But like you said, we had flash video content.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.440]   We're having to convert completely to a player.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.200]   The break-cove player, actually, is what we're using
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.840]   so that we can run on the iPad and on the iOS devices.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.280]   So it forced a change on our part
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.600]   because we were doing video the Flash way, which
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.720]   is how most people do it.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   Now we've got to do it HTML5.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   So now on byte.com, the revenue is from ads,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.360]   or I see you can register.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.120]   There are-- can you pay for it?
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:52.960]   How does this work?
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.840]   Look at how we were on Times Square.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.400]   Do you see that?
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.560]   I know this is beautiful.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.320]   I mean, this was an amazing thing.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.000]   I'm always fighting with them about an editorial budget.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.720]   They call me and say, hey, we got a billboard on Times Square.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.400]   I was like, that's amazing.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.800]   I hope that didn't cost as much as a full-time writer.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.680]   Well, you know, PR Newswire is a company that
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.520]   is part of United Business Media, which is what bought byte
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.480]   and just brought it back.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.760]   And so PR Newswire gave it to us as a gift.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.880]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.760]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.080]   I was like, that's a nice thing.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.320]   Really, the lion looked like a lamb chop from Sherry.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.880]   The lion looks just like lamb chop.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   That's how I envision lion looking.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.920]   If it ever comes back.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.880]   So a lot of videos are going to be--
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.480]   Bites going to be video heavy.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:37.960]   Is that right?
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.160]   Lots of video, lots of photos.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.600]   I mean, there's probably a terabyte of data already on byte.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.880]   Through our how-to galleries, through videos, through shows,
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.520]   five little podcasts, tiny little podcasts, 10-minute podcast.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.560]   We're going to do a big one.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.760]   Bike cast will be part of the Twitter.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.400]   We are.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.720]   Starting soon.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.560]   Gina will host that.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.880]   With Jerry Purnell.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.220]   Really?
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.160]   Is Jerry going to be a regular on Bike cast?
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.480]   He wants to be a regular.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.000]   That's awesome.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.040]   And I'm happy to have him.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   I mean, he's already filed two columns.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:08.600]   I love Jerry.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.800]   So I'm at a 77 years old.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.400]   And his column was tremendous when he came in.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.240]   And I think the best sentence of the whole week on byte
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.200]   was Jerry Purnell's sentence that said,
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.000]   "The tablet wars pass like dreams."
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.840]   I don't know what that means, but it's lyrical.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.440]   They're evanescent.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.400]   Is there evanescent?
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:29.900]   Yes.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.160]   Yes.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.120]   But Jerry Purnell is back, and he's psyched,
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.760]   and he's sending me tons of email.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.560]   He's the name.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.760]   I mean, when you say Bike Magazine,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.200]   he's the name everybody associates.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.400]   Us old farts anyway.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.600]   I'm Chaos Manor.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.240]   Chaos Manor.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.440]   That's what really got me started.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.200]   In thinking in terms of covering technology
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.840]   from the user point of view, he was the first to do that.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.720]   Say, I'm a user first, last, and always.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.120]   And this is going to be a column by a user about being a user.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:58.880]   That was different.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.520]   That was unique.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.000]   And I think great.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.760]   That's what Jerry is all about.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.480]   And if you look at his column, he says,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.520]   I'm trying to get a hang of eBooks here.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.760]   And here's my experience with the Kindle.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.200]   And that's what Jerry is all about.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.840]   His big library with all those books behind him,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   and now he's going totally electronic.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.240]   I love libraries.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.040]   We don't know exactly when Bike Cast is going to launch,
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.920]   but we'll let you know it'll be the next month or so.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.440]   We'll be doing it right from the--
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.560]   Have we signed a deal yet?
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:25.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.480]   We've got a deal.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   I just can't-- I don't know exactly what--
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.000]   The business people.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.040]   I'm the last one to know.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.600]   No, the business people is handling it right now.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.960]   We'll let them figure that out.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.960]   But I think we do have a deal.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.560]   It's just a question of waiting till we have a studio for you.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.360]   This is the last tweet we're doing from the original Twitter
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:42.720]   cottage.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.080]   We're going to be moving.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:44.960]   You've been here, Denise.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.640]   You've been here, Gina.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.680]   Have you ever been to the cottage, Jenny?
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.120]   No, I haven't had the pleasure.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.480]   You're never going to see it.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.360]   This is it.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.800]   It's over.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.440]   But you've got to come up and see the new studio,
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.640]   because it's just beautiful.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.480]   It's fantastic.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.240]   And thank you for posting the photos that you have on Google
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.720]   Plus, and I think on Twitter as well.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.600]   I've really enjoyed seeing it come together.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.600]   And I can imagine how excited you must be.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.480]   It is so fun.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:06.840]   Anyway--
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.800]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.560]   Not to get into this.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.240]   I wanted to talk about Netflix.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.320]   So this Netflix basically announced-- well, I don't know.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.960]   You could say it was a price increase.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.840]   I mean, there's no question.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.800]   If you have a Netflix account that includes disks,
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.400]   you're going to pay more for the same service.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.240]   But you could also say they split streaming from disks.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.080]   Streaming will still be $7.99.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.400]   Discs will be what they were.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.040]   Any Netflix users in the group?
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.000]   Yes, of course.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.480]   Yeah, of course.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.200]   Oh, you too, Jenny.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:37.720]   OK.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.880]   I thought Jenny might be like, you might only
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.560]   use BitTorrent or something.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:49.000]   So the legal service that I'm a fan of is Netflix.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.200]   Nicely put.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:55.480]   So there still is, I think, a lot of heat on this.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.520]   What is going on?
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.960]   First of all, why did Netflix do this?
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.360]   Are they going to lose business?
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.480]   Or is this something they had to do?
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.120]   Denise, what do you think?
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.600]   I think they had to do it.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.480]   I think they've been offering really attractive pricing
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.760]   for a while because they could.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.200]   And now that they are so popular,
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.400]   it's just not being left on the table as an option for them.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.920]   And they've got to pass it through somehow.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.720]   Is it Hollywood that's making them do this or pure economics?
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.560]   I think it's both.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.680]   I think in order to renew their licenses
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.640]   with some of their partners, people
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.680]   are coming in and saying, hey, well, you guys have gotten huge
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.880]   since we negotiated this.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.440]   And it's time to pay the piper.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.760]   So--
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.480]   Do they not have any clout with Hollywood?
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.760]   I mean, isn't this how most of us now watch movies?
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.400]   Yeah, I think it is the way most of us now watch movies,
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.760]   especially if you have kids, right?
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.160]   That you definitely have enough, like, accounts.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.600]   You can download those movies for them.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.080]   And I think one thing that people have to remember,
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.440]   and they so often forget is these companies
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.880]   aren't into it for the users.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.640]   They're final obligation at the end of the day
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.120]   is to their stockholders.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.720]   And if they can raise prices, they will raise prices
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.120]   to what the market will bear.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.360]   It's still a good deal, I guess.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:12.920]   I mean--
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.680]   I think it's still a good deal and people will pay it.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.200]   Compared to what--
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.600]   We'll be upset about it.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.600]   Oh, they are upset.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.440]   Compared to what movie ticket costs are.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.360]   I mean, people went to see Harry Potter this weekend,
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.560]   spent $25 for two tickets, at least.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.280]   Yeah, that's what my little boy is doing right now.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.040]   That's the only reason it's quiet in here.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:31.600]   They are--
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.640]   They are watching Harry Potter.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.440]   They're starting to have competition, too.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.480]   Amazon Instant, with its Prime tie-in,
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.560]   is right in there with them.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.680]   And so, at least there's some pressure on them,
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.760]   not to just take the pricing through the roof.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.400]   That's a good point.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.120]   Prime is free, but it's not nearly as extensive a collection
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.080]   as Netflix has.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.080]   But it gets the new releases, though.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.160]   It gets the on demand, the things that
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   would come on your cable or satellite on demand.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.240]   That's interesting.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.000]   Could you be a cable cutter?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.680]   Who me?
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.160]   Could she cut the cable?
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   I mean, I think this is going to be more and more.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.640]   This is an increasing question, because a cable television,
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.000]   over $100.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.880]   I thought for a second you were talking
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.720]   about doing something more nefarious than--
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.000]   Not physically.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.880]   Not with a one-sheary cut to get.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.360]   No.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.840]   But I mean, could you disconnect?
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.440]   I'll tell you what, I got so mad with Comcast
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.680]   that I switched to a DSL provider,
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.400]   because right now in my neighborhood,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.280]   between 7 and 10 PM, I get no bandwidth,
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.160]   because everybody's freaking watching Netflix.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.960]   And Comcast, it's not in their interest that people do this.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.400]   They want you to watch video on demand.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.120]   So I'm convinced that they're not
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.600]   putting any more bandwidth in because they don't want this
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.080]   to happen.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.680]   So I went to a DSL provider.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.440]   It won't be as fast burst, but at least it will be consistent.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.840]   And I'll be able to watch my movies.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   I think that the movie industry doesn't like DVDs,
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.280]   because it's a piracy--
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   They never have.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.680]   They want you to watch streaming.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.360]   The cable companies want you to watch video on demand.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.480]   They don't want you to watch streaming,
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.480]   because you're buying bits at wholesale.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.600]   You've got all these interests fighting against each other.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.800]   And the only people who really are the victims are us.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.960]   I mean, you're right, Gina.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.040]   They have no fiduciary responsibility to us.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.640]   It's all to the--
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.240]   No, they don't care about the customers.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.080]   And they shouldn't.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.840]   I mean, they-- Well, they care to the degree that if we all
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.840]   leave them, they're going to care.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.240]   Well, that's what I was going to say.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.520]   If you're mad about this, you should vote with your dollars,
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.960]   change your service.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.320]   And that's the only way that the companies will respond.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.080]   This is the customer's--
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.280]   Yeah, and to answer your question, Leo,
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.960]   I would totally be a cable cutter.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.440]   If I didn't have someone in my household who's just
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.720]   become in order to channel flipping,
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.080]   just loves to sit on the couch and go through your stuff
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.720]   and stuff like this.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.080]   You have to stop him.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.600]   You can't allow this to happen.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.080]   Sit down, watch Finney's and Furman, shut up.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.520]   That's right.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   Hide the remote.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.120]   I hit the remote long, long ago.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.800]   Nobody has any access to remote.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.720]   Hit or lost, Gina.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.360]   Hit.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:02.800]   Hit.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.200]   Let's be honest, really?
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:04.920]   No, no, no.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.160]   Well, first I lost it.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.280]   But then I kept it.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.640]   You found it and you left it there.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.920]   Yes, there was so much Dora I could take.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.080]   Dora the Explorer.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.040]   Dora the--
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.280]   I'm glad you don't have Barney.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.240]   Mike has her grew up with Barney.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.160]   We have Barney.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.040]   There's Barney still alive?
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.760]   Those, by the way, both available on BitTorrent.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.520]   You can get Barney a BitTorrent?
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.640]   Really?
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.240]   That's just--
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.360]   That's in the deeper sense.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:30.840]   That's just sick.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.640]   There's somebody in Bolivia that has it.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.440]   I love you.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.640]   You love me.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.440]   Are you--
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.520]   Jenny, I know you are.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.760]   Denise, I know you are hooked on Google+, aren't we?
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.400]   I like it.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.840]   I cut the cord with Facebook--
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.240]   I don't know.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.760]   I guess it was about a year ago.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.840]   And it's interesting to see another very, very large country--
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.440]   excuse me, very, very large company with it.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.160]   It is a country.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:54.960]   You're right.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.800]   With a very large user base, come into something like this
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.320]   as right as they've gotten it from day one.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   Not all of it is right, but it is a heck of a lot more
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.440]   right than Facebook and my people.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.000]   Now you're honoring Google's request not to put brands in.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.840]   Oh, no, you've added Boing Boing.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.920]   Yeah, just for kicks.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.680]   We're also talking with the people at Google+
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.760]   who will be rolling out the proper way for brands
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.880]   to come online.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.340]   And whatever they tell us to do, we'll
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.680]   do to get Boing Boing in there appropriately.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.120]   Yeah, but for right now--
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.480]   It's kind of hard not to--
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.440]   Laff and Squid is doing it.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.000]   We have to.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.280]   Well, I don't know.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.680]   Laff and Squid, but even Ford.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.680]   A lot of people are doing this.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.240]   And it's hard not to.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.080]   I've held back.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.040]   I applied for the brand program or whatever they're
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.280]   going to do it for a twit.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:44.960]   I held back.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.520]   Is Bite on Google+?
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.720]   Gina?
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.360]   Not yet.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.320]   You held back.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:49.760]   You held back.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.920]   We held back so far.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.480]   But we've been just a little busy.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.680]   I have to say, as a brand, it's probably very difficult
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.920]   to not put your stuff in there.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.440]   Yeah, where was the one?
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.120]   Especially when you see Mashable suddenly leap
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.280]   into the number four position of followers,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.440]   as they always seem to do.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.240]   I don't know how they do it every time.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.200]   Yeah, Google+ is interesting because it allows yourself
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.000]   to kind of do a do-over.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.240]   So if you're like me, I was just telling one of your guys
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.160]   at T&T this week, you do a do-over.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.720]   Because if you're like me and you're a social slut
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.880]   and you just say, OK to everybody who has ever invited you,
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.120]   you end up with thousands of friends on Facebook.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.880]   I don't know who these people are that I'm connected with.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:37.200]   Now I can maybe try again with Google+ or maybe try
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.600]   to not do this ever again.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.280]   So you're not going to make the same mistakes on Google+
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:41.960]   that you made up this one?
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.840]   No, I'm going to be a little more selective this.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.600]   Not going to be a social slut, huh?
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.320]   No.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.920]   It's all about the animated cat gifs.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.760]   I've got to just tell it like it is here.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.960]   It's all about the what?
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.480]   Animated cat gifs.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.520]   Yeah, you seem to post a lot of those.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.600]   You're like I'm the only one.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.680]   I've been meaning to tell-- I've been meaning to say something,
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   Jenny.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.240]   We're still in the middle of catter getting, as you said.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.200]   Catter getting.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.320]   Catter getting.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.040]   Well, I love there's one in here.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.760]   Oh, dear.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.280]   You know what?
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.840]   This is the one I couldn't stop staring at.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.560]   I think I wonder if Google-- I really
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.200]   wonder if Google knew when they said,
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.560]   what animated gifs?
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.360]   They must add a meeting, right?
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.760]   And everybody's there.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.200]   Vic Gundotra's there.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.760]   Bradley Horowitz, probably Larry and Sergey are there.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.040]   Marissa Myers there.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.640]   And they're sitting around and they're going, animated gifs.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.160]   What do we do?
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.080]   Animated gifs are already having kind of a comeback.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.480]   There are serious intellectual discussions happening
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.280]   on blogs about animated gifs as an art form, the fact
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.200]   that they restrict and that they offer certain agreed-upon
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.280]   parameters and limitations like that,
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   creative limitations like that, are always interesting
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.960]   for artists.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.240]   And I think that they're an interesting colloquial art
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:52.920]   form.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.520]   And Anil Dash did a really interesting essay about this
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.920]   a few weeks ago, actually.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.760]   And our own, Dean Putney from "Boyne Borne"
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.200]   has--
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:02.720]   Just last week's book.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.000]   Are you asserting that this cat on the treadmill
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.880]   is an art form?
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   Animated gifs here.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.680]   You know, people in Francisco Picasso
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.560]   and said my kid could do this.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.320]   And he can feel something to insult the obese Maine
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.800]   coon cat on an underwater treadmill, the old report.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.320]   But the story ends 5, 10, 10--
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.360]   You know, I think Tumblr was the one that opened the door
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:27.860]   on this.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.200]   Of course, animated gifs practically killed my space.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:31.720]   Yes.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.800]   Because they were everywhere and it was bling bling
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.760]   and all that stuff.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.760]   But Tumblr--
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.680]   Those were dumb little icons, just like junkie blinking icons.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.960]   This is different.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.400]   It says something for Google+ that it can bring in both Tommy
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.080]   Anderson and automated gifs and five in that environment.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.720]   And then don't forget Zook, all five of him.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.280]   Yes.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.600]   But now we know that there is one actual one and only truly,
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   right?
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.800]   Or no.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.680]   We don't know.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.080]   We don't know that.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:01.560]   We don't know that.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.800]   Scoble asserts, and I saw the text a couple of weeks ago,
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.080]   that one that's on the top of the charts, the one
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.480]   with 120,000 followers.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.120]   That's actually--
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.360]   That's actually--
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.840]   By the way, my favorite animated gif site is still
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.000]   a Tumblr blog.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.040]   It's called Animals Being Dicks.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.720]   Have you seen that?
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.560]   Leo.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.080]   Leo.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.400]   No, no.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.760]   Have you seen this?
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.280]   No.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.120]   In data I have, it's a brilliant Tumblr.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.400]   It's a Tumblr of greatness.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.080]   It is the most wonderful Tumblr you've ever seen
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.480]   of animals just being jerky.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.880]   I mean corny.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.800]   I didn't even know that was possible.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.160]   I don't know where they get all these.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.560]   But they are just--
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.240]   and their animated gifs-- so because they're animated gifs,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.880]   they start playing immediately.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.600]   They loop, and you just have to watch it over and over
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.320]   and over again, right?
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:52.800]   Yes.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.080]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.520]   Oh, dear.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.520]   Oh, dear.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.520]   Oh, dear.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.040]   Oh, dear.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.600]   Some of this not safe for work.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.840]   Well, if animal--
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.640]   Not children.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.200]   Well, I don't know.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.080]   Yeah, I wonder about the Google+ phenomenon.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.840]   And if this whole audience is not a bunch of self-selecting
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.240]   technophiles, we're all saying, oh, wow, a new shiny thing.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.400]   Let's go look at Google+.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.960]   And over the long term, can Google really sustain this?
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.680]   Well, you know, all the people on Facebook really move over.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.960]   I'm not paying any attention.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.160]   I'm watching.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:25.480]   I'm not--
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.000]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.480]   Why I was trying not to look at the screen.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.520]   I'm watching animals being dicks.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.120]   I'm so sorry.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:31.840]   That's OK.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.640]   I think that's--
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.120]   This is my favorite one, the giraffe and the elephant.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:37.760]   The elephant just--
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.280]   That's an ostrich.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:38.920]   I'm ostrich.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.840]   Whatever it's going.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.040]   What is that?
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.800]   This is an elephant that just gets
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.520]   tired of being picked up by the ostrich.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.960]   It finally just takes things in his own hands.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.040]   There's a good metaphor in that somewhere.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:50.400]   Really?
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.920]   Yes.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.360]   I had dinner with Ice-T's manager this weekend.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.800]   Ice-T's manager told me a story about how Ice-T and public
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.360]   enemy were all on their tour bus at some small town
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.680]   in Australia.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.880]   And after they'd finished their show, there's just one guy,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.480]   like this Australian guy sitting on the corner,
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.280]   heckling Ice-T.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.240]   Like, Ice-T's a really serious guy, right?
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.080]   So this guy is sitting on the corner,
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.960]   heckling him, threatening him.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.160]   Goes on for like 20 minutes, and everybody on the bus
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.680]   is just kind of looking at Ice-T.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.400]   Wondering if he's going to do anything.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.520]   He's just kind of sitting there like that.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.160]   And then right around the 20-minute mark,
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.760]   it just quietly gets off the bus, walks up to the dude,
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.560]   clocks him in the face, breaks his jaw,
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.280]   and then walks back on the tour bus
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.800]   and sits right back down.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.560]   It does absolutely nothing.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.200]   Everybody's like, yeah, that's Ice-T.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.520]   And that elephant, that elephant is like Ice-T.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.840]   By the way, I know that story, because you shared it
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.560]   on Google+, and I'm loving Google+,
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.680]   because of the quality of content like that,
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.560]   where Jenny could write a, I don't know,
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.760]   that was three or four hundred word post.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.120]   It was like five tweets.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.480]   It was great.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.320]   It was five tweets.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.400]   It was so much better than Twitter,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.640]   and the engagement's so much better.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.320]   And you can't do this on Twitter.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.840]   I mean, I have to say that Jenny's posts,
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.560]   and that's a reshare, by the way.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.400]   That's a reshare.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.000]   I used the animated gif thing just honestly.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.320]   It is an interesting experiment to see how,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.840]   it's like looking at an organism
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.880]   and seeing how the blood flows.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.600]   And animated gifs are something that's sticky,
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.920]   it's very shareable, people get really worked up about it,
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:30.240]   and you can see how interesting content flows.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.640]   Like, you can't do it with porn, right?
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.480]   But--
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.240]   But you know, we might look back at Google+,
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.440]   and say, you know the thing they did write animated gifs?
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.440]   Exactly.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.720]   But we're talking about, will this work, will this last,
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.240]   will it have sustaining power?
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.440]   It's way, way, way too early to know.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.360]   With Twitter, I remember in the first six months
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.800]   of being on board, I was, I don't know,
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.600]   first 500, first 800 users on Twitter.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.000]   I thought it was totally worthless, totally annoying,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   and I let my account go dormant for another six months
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.080]   when I came back and saw that this had evolved
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.040]   into something really interesting.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:09.560]   So--
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.000]   I was exactly the same.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.960]   Exactly the same.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.440]   Me too.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.480]   And this is exactly the opposite.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.200]   So we were saying that we just don't know,
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.000]   that Twitter we didn't know because it wasn't obvious.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.800]   We just don't know.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.880]   This is the part of what makes a network great is the architecture.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.240]   Part of what makes a network great
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.880]   is the size of the user base.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.320]   Part of what makes a network great
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:35.560]   is the ease with which the social connections can
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.320]   evolve and mutate over time.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.200]   And I think they've got enough of all of those three things
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   going for them.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.840]   Lord knows they got the user base.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.560]   I would add a fourth at this beginning part,
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.600]   and that is the fact that there's so little,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.800]   or if any, content being pushed in there that's coming
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.880]   from somewhere else that's not native to good plus.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.320]   I love it.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.920]   That's what friend feed did wrong.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.600]   That's what pounced it wrong.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.920]   It is all native content.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.520]   So it's not leftovers and stuff that's coming from.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.000]   It's actually made me rethink.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.320]   Mike Elgin's got his social media Google+ diet
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.520]   that he's on where he's just switched exclusively
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.120]   to that medium.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.520]   And I could see doing that.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.080]   But what it's done for me is made me rethink how I use Twitter
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.680]   and Facebook, which are basically the only other things
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.760]   I use.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.280]   And right before the show today, I
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.440]   clicked that setting in Facebook that
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.800]   takes my Twitter stream out of it.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.600]   People have asked me to do it before.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.320]   And I just-- it's too time consuming
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.280]   to post multiple places and more efficient to do it this way.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.040]   But it's just awful.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.000]   I have stopped.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.480]   Maybe the right way to do this.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.280]   I don't know about Facebook.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.920]   The right way to do this is to have Twitter
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.800]   be this kind of automated stream.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.680]   It's a dial tone.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.360]   It's a nervous system of stuff that
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.520]   can be aggregated, collated, searched,
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:49.320]   put into Flipboard, and then have the real true engagement
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.720]   happen on Google+.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.040]   Facebook, well, that's where you kind of hang out
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.000]   with your family, because I can't get my family to use Google+.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.400]   You should call Vic.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.200]   Call Vic and give him that idea, Leah.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:44:59.920]   That's a good idea.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.200]   We actually-- well, Google+ launched.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.400]   We had Vic and Bradley on this week in Google.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:03.920]   Really?
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.640]   It talked a lot.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.040]   They've been very open.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.160]   And that's another thing I think Google's done right,
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:15.200]   is they've really participated with the community over Google+.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.880]   And now there are at least 10 million.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.080]   We know there's 10 million, because Larry Page in the earnings
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:24.400]   call this week said, yes, we've got 10 million people in Google+.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.920]   We have a billion shares a day in Google+.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.360]   Wow.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:30.720]   Actually, they're--
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.520]   That's amazing.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   And he posted, by the way, notes from his earnings
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.960]   call in his Google+ stream.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.560]   Crazy.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.200]   It is crazy.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.480]   They're eating their own dog food, as they say.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.120]   They just call dog fooding.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.120]   Yeah, dog fooding.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:44.800]   Have they--
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.080]   Is it Facebook that has prohibited Google+ use,
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.200]   or Google that has prohibited Facebook?
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.320]   Facebook's done a few antagonistic things.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.400]   They kicked a guy out for advertising on Facebook.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.320]   That's right.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.400]   That he-- come watch me on Google+.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.880]   They banned that ad.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.640]   They've also turned off--
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.880]   I've been told-- the porting of Facebook--
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.000]   the only way you'd get your Facebook stuff in a Google+
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   was to go to Yahoo first with your Facebook contacts.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.960]   And then from Yahoo and to Google+.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.760]   And apparently they've turned that off as well.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.340]   I can't verify that, but I've been told it
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.560]   turned that off as well.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.440]   It's very interesting.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.080]   What I heard is that over at Google,
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.520]   all these employees for Google+ are heavily
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.760]   in-scented with bonuses to make sure that Google+ works.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.840]   Not just Google+.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.880]   The bonus structure at Google this year
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.720]   is tied to Google's success in social for every single person
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.760]   at Google.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.680]   So it's pretty clear that this is a high profile,
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.160]   high importance.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.740]   Yeah, Google has failed in terms of social network
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.280]   in the past over and over.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.200]   So this is what their fourth or fifth attempt
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.840]   at really coming forth.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.800]   And I think so far, so good.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   It's looking really good.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.240]   There's no buzz.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:55.760]   Say no what?
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.040]   Yeah, this is no buzz.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.640]   This isn't Google+.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.240]   It's certainly much better and looks like it has a lot more
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.440]   staying power than Google+.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.920]   And to your point, Jenny, I loved Google+.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.760]   So I immediately groked that and said,
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.440]   oh, that was great.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.760]   And that died.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.720]   Have any of you guys--
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.740]   spend some time on doing Hangouts?
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.860]   I really like the video--
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:16.780]   It's pretty cool.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:17.280]   I like it.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.740]   People at once, it works better than Skype.
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.940]   And we could actually do that at work.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.900]   We could all open a Hangout and just sit around
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.140]   so we don't have to talk to each other at work.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:30.620]   So my question is, for Google+, does it
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.380]   have to be necessary for some percentage of Facebook people
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.020]   to just dump Facebook and switch over?
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.660]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.140]   Because I don't think it's going to happen either.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.060]   I think Twitter continues Facebook continues.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.960]   It's just one more.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.640]   So you've got LinkedIn for your professional network.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.400]   You've got Twitter.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.320]   You've got Facebook.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.120]   And then now you've got--
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.040]   That's an awful lot, isn't it?
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.360]   That's an awful lot.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.120]   It's awful lot.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.160]   I mean, is there really room at the table for a fourth?
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.680]   I mean, right now it's all exciting.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.800]   But I'd like to see it in six months
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.160]   and see what really happens with the bulk of users.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.640]   Or is it just a self-selecting small group,
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.240]   all checking it out, excited about the animated GIFs,
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.440]   et cetera?
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.920]   And in six months, let's see Vic.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.400]   We also might assume that Google has a few other tricks up
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.020]   their sleeve, right?
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.460]   I mean, there may be more to come.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.100]   That's right.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.100]   Style stuff.
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.080]   For instance--
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:23.580]   Go ahead.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.200]   Sorry, go ahead, Leah.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.260]   No, you go ahead, Deethis.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.340]   Well, I was just going to say, I think over the next six
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:33.540]   months, I could see my professional network on Google+
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:34.260]   doing much more.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.540]   And maybe that's because of the industry I pay attention to.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.840]   So I might be more scared if I were linked in, which I've never
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.240]   really used or found to use for at all.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.600]   So basically a resume posting service, I don't get it.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.720]   With more of the family and people
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.080]   who are not in the technology world, old friends,
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.800]   staying on Facebook.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.600]   But gradually, I think moving over to Google+2
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.160]   and using it in parallel, because of the way
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.560]   that Google+ brings people in once you add them to a circle,
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.360]   and also because of the buzz it's getting.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.780]   You know what I like most about Google+ so far?
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.560]   No stupid games.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:12.560]   I don't think they'll--
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.300]   No farm value.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.660]   Do you think they'll put games on there?
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.860]   I don't think they're going to do games.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.300]   You know, they might.
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.740]   But just the fact that it works, and then I
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.460]   don't have to go through so many layers of crap to get to them.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.300]   I agree with you.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:21.740]   I agree with you.
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.380]   I agree with you.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.020]   They had games in Wave.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.420]   They had little plug-ins you could play chess and stuff
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:27.820]   and Wave.
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.580]   So maybe they'll do something like that.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.460]   I don't want to see that.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.620]   I think conversation-- keep it about conversation
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.300]   and animated cat gifts.
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.860]   Google, by the way, did have a very, very good quarter, $9
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:46.400]   billion in revenue for the quarter, up 32% year over year.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.040]   They're obviously doing quite well.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.040]   Did you see Steven Levy's book?
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.240]   Did any of you guys read Steven--
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:53.800]   Yeah, in the plex.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.480]   -- would you take?
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.320]   I love the book.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.080]   I thought, well, I like all of Steven Levy's work.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.480]   He's such a great reporter and what a good writer.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.560]   But you really get a feel for what
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.960]   it's like to be part of that juggernaut.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:10.140]   Well, and there's the new Google book by--
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.140]   Oh gosh.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.020]   William James had a word for this, the tip of the tongue syndrome.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.300]   Yes, all getting old.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.480]   Big old.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.860]   No, I called him to the white album.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.580]   That might help.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.080]   Really?
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.540]   The white album, number nine.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.380]   I'm looking at the chatroom.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.380]   I really consider the chatroom my externalization
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.060]   of my brain.
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.380]   I've poured them.
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.820]   My gray cells have been poured into the chatroom.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.460]   Do they know?
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.340]   Ask them.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.060]   I'm looking at the white people.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.460]   They're not knowing what I'm talking about.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.100]   It's a guy who left Google.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.820]   I'm feeling lucky in the same of the book.
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.380]   And it's about the early days of the book.
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.300]   You can Google that.
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.180]   Paul Adams, thank you very much.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.260]   OK, there you go, Paul Adams.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.100]   And apparently also very interesting book.
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.620]   We're trying to get him on one of our shows.
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.860]   We'd love to get him to talk.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.220]   Hey, well, we're going to take a break,
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:57.780]   come back with more.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.300]   Love this panel.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:50:59.980]   Love this panel.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:03.820]   Denise Howell is here from our show this week in law.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.980]   You do that show every Friday.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.380]   What time?
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.540]   11 AM?
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.260]   11 AM.
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.620]   I know it's your day off.
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:09.380]   Well, I watch.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.660]   We run the studio with that today.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.740]   You are in charge.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:14.740]   And you're going to have a nice new studio to use next week.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.100]   Yes.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.100]   11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.940]   You can also download it after the fact of twit.tv/twill.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.180]   And always really good conversation
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:29.300]   about the legalities, the stuff that's going on.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:33.220]   And really, law is about 90% of a lot of what's going on.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.060]   Well, sure.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.740]   You use this stuff and it's all pushing the edges of what's
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.740]   legal or contemplated under the law in various ways.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.900]   And so we always have fun stuff to talk about.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.180]   Always a lawsuit or two dimension.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.220]   Oh, there's like six this week, right?
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.780]   Google's being hit from all directions this week by lawsuits.
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:54.340]   And at what point are we going to talk about the slow speed
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.100]   car chases and Casey Anthony getting out of jail?
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:57.980]   You want to do that?
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.780]   Really?
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:51:59.220]   Really?
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.500]   You want to do that?
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.140]   I was funny.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.620]   I was reading and probably was on Google+
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:07.120]   because I think it's where I get all my news about how they left
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.220]   jail at 1230 in the morning.
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:14.620]   And the reporters follow the car via helicopter.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:19.060]   They're following the car to a parking lot at her attorneys.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.820]   And then they can't figure out where she went.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:24.220]   But a private jet left from the executive airport.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.340]   And so the helicopters are swarming there.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.180]   Maybe that's it.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.300]   It went to Colorado where parents live.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.860]   No, it's a bunch of golfers.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.580]   It was like, really, this is the most important thing in the world.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:34.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:35.900]   Guess what?
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.380]   You just got trolled.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.180]   This is a crayon, Jenny.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:41.680]   No.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.100]   You're pulling me in.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.020]   No, I would like to talk about the other big scandal.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.060]   It's on the other side of the pond.
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.740]   The Rupert Murdoch scandal, a big address.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:51.420]   Scandal.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.940]   Having got rid of that newspaper after the zig in here.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.740]   Rebecca, what's her name?
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.660]   Rebecca Brooks got arrested today.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.900]   She-- I don't know if she'll be able to testify in Parliament
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.380]   on Tuesday.
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.500]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.100]   Before we do, though, I want to talk about the secret
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.540]   behind exceptional websites are good friends at squarespace.com
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:14.340]   hosting plus software, giving you the best possible experience.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.500]   If you're ready to set up your own boing boing,
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.260]   your own animated gift forum, this is a great place to go.
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.140]   It's not-- you know, there are other choices
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.660]   like Tumblr and WordPress and Typepad.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.220]   But there is no better hosting out there
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.660]   and no better content management system than Squarespace.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.100]   So if you really want to do the best--
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.020]   and let me tell you the best to use Squarespace.
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.020]   Look at the example sites.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.020]   You'll see so many well-known names,
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:43.460]   businesses, restaurants, nonprofits, photographers, too.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.700]   Because Squarespace gives you great-looking sites
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   that are unique, that don't look like anybody else's site.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.700]   They do that because you start with 60-plus designer templates
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.300]   that you can completely customize with drag and drop point
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:57.700]   and click.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.540]   You don't have to be a CSS or a JavaScript wizard
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.020]   to create a great-looking Squarespace site.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:03.540]   And it's easy.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.940]   Your first site, just go to the squarespace.com
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.380]   and click this big green try-it-free button.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.180]   They won't ask you for a credit card, just the name
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.580]   of your site, a password, and an email address
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.260]   so they can get ahold of you.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.380]   And that's it.
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.740]   And you're up and running.
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:17.860]   You can use all the features.
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.300]   They're great iPhone and iPad app that
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.020]   let you not only post but moderate comments
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.780]   and also see their great stats, amazing stats.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.500]   You know exactly who's visiting your site.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.900]   Photo galleries, social media integration,
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.420]   all with point and click drag and drop.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.820]   But if you are a CSS wizard, you can also do anything.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.340]   The sky's the limit.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.980]   Now, Squarespace is very affordable.
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.300]   You're getting hosting and you're getting the software already
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.500]   updated, always secure for as little as $10 a month,
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.340]   depending on how long you sign up for.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.540]   But I'm going to add a little something-something for you.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.900]   If you use the offer code TWIT7 when you buy,
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.820]   we'll take another 10% off for the first six months
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.020]   of your site.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:03.140]   So it really is an affordable deal.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.580]   I want you to give Squarespace a try.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.660]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.300]   These guys are so great.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.540]   They've done such a great job of making a platform that's
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.900]   easy to use.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:15.260]   I just got my ham license and I've already signed up.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.260]   w6twt.org will be on squarespace.com
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.100]   as soon as I get those call signs.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.420]   I better get those call signs.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:23.580]   Love that picture of you with all the hams.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.580]   Yeah, wasn't that funny?
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.460]   Yes.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.660]   Oh my god, they're so cute.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:27.540]   I showed that to my wife.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:30.100]   She said, oh, these are the cute boys
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.020]   you're hanging out with now, huh?
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:33.460]   I should--
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.060]   They were hanging out with dorky ham radio.
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:41.180]   You know, don't knock at the hands and save in the wild.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:44.580]   I've always been in radio, but I never did amateur radio.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:48.540]   And we do a ham show called Ham Nation.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.020]   And they kind of convinced me that I really
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.380]   should get my ham license.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.140]   Here's the picture of Leo.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:54.900]   There it is.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.140]   And the examiners.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.700]   OK, they're not-- they're not dorks.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.140]   They're really cool.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.060]   Oh, come on.
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:01.860]   Oh, come on.
[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:02.900]   But you know what's interesting?
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.060]   I fit right in.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.180]   Ham was the original social network.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:07.660]   It is.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.140]   It still is.
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:08.900]   It really was.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:12.180]   You know what surprised me is I thought, oh, this is probably
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.700]   a hobby that's kind of dying out because after all,
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.100]   we have the internet and cell phones now.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.300]   We don't really need to carry a five watt radio in our back
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.860]   pocket.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.180]   But there were 10 or 15 people taking the test.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:27.460]   Ham is still growing.
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.420]   There are a lot of amateurs.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.900]   And many of them are in our audience, which I didn't know.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:31.860]   So I'm looking forward to it.
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:34.220]   The new studio we'll have-- I'm really excited--
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.860]   a radio corner.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.300]   So we're going to have a great ham set up
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.540]   so people can come from out of town and broadcast.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.140]   Because I guess you can do that.
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.380]   If I have a license, you can use my gear broadcast on it.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.660]   And we're going to set up really nice.
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:49.860]   Bob Heiland, Gordon Wester, going to set up.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.100]   Beautiful set up there.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.660]   But then, next to it, we're going to have a 1940s Collins AM
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:58.460]   radio transmitter glowing.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:58.980]   Glowing.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.500]   Glowing.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.220]   We're going to have an old '50s console with the big knobs.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.540]   We're going to have a turntables cart machine.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.860]   It's going to be a little old radio station set up in there.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:09.140]   Just--
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:09.820]   That's cool.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:13.740]   --a museum of analog technology.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.940]   And maybe you'll see some of these guys.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.820]   And bring some of those guys.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.220]   Is this guy on the upper left, Wilford Brimley?
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:22.220]   It does look like Wilford Brimley, doesn't he?
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.260]   So do they still do postcards, Leo?
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.460]   When you call up to Pitcairn Island,
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.820]   do you get your postcard back?
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.220]   QSL cards, they call them.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:29.740]   Yay.
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.660]   We're going to make a QSL card for Twitch
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.260]   so that when people de-excess, when they talk to us remotely,
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.140]   they'll get a little sentimental postcard like this
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.660]   when a QSL card.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:43.260]   No, it's easy to make fun of hams because they're nerds, right?
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.140]   But we're nerds, baby.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.620]   Are you nerds or are you geeks?
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.580]   Well, not only that, but what I'm getting at
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.300]   is social networks.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.260]   They own your content with ham radio.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:54.820]   There's none of that.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:55.700]   It's like--
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.180]   It sort of passes out there into the ether, but you own it.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.980]   It really is a DIY social network.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:02.420]   And it's something that predates a lot of us here.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.380]   Thank you for acknowledging that.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.140]   It's absolutely true.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.820]   And many of the technologies we use today
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.900]   were created by hams, including the packet radio
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.460]   that we use on our cell phones and--
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.460]   Including emergency--
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.700]   Personal computer.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:19.380]   In emergency, unfortunately, everything breaks down.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.420]   All this technology that we rely on and emergency,
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.500]   just to ask the folks in New Orleans,
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.980]   stops working and--
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:29.700]   Because when this goes down, Google Plus
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:30.420]   is not going to save your--
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.140]   Is not going to save your bacon.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:34.860]   And even seriously, even Twitter
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:38.260]   relies on certain things being stable in terms of connectivity.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.500]   And when it really hits the fan,
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.740]   ham radio will save your butt.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.420]   And you will thank these people that you are marking these dorks
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.140]   now.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:45.580]   They do.
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.940]   And they're organized to make sure that happens.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.620]   And you go across the street, was in the local network
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.780]   that is supposed to stay alive when everything else goes down.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.420]   That's right.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.140]   Police feed them information.
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:59.220]   It's really-- it's a very interesting subculture.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:03.660]   And because-- let's be honest, we're in a subculture
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.220]   that has been mocked and ridiculed.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.540]   We were the nerds in school.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.580]   I don't know about you guys.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.340]   You're all gorgeous.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:11.300]   But I was the nerd in school.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.420]   And I kind of have this--
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.820]   it's funny because I guess there's a pecking order.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.940]   And so we digital nerds kind of look down on the analog nerds.
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:21.860]   But really, no, we're all the same.
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:25.860]   And it's really kind of fun to become part of this subculture.
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.500]   So I'm very-- I'm excited about it.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.060]   Good to see you.
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.460]   I'm excited for you, Leo.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.420]   I mean, this was doing the Wozniak thing.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.180]   This was the thing he was proudest of,
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.580]   was that he was a kid and he got his ham radio license.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:39.900]   A lot of people in technology got their start in ham radio.
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.340]   Absolutely.
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:40.900]   They did.
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:41.700]   Absolutely.
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.700]   And building Heath Kits and all that stuff.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:44.700]   Heath Kits.
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:49.140]   It's the maker revolution, but 50, 30 years ago.
[00:59:49.140 --> 01:00:06.900]   Pre-
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:11.900]   You know, like if you need help, social networks aren't going to save you.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.580]   The founder of Twitter is being interviewed by somebody from the New York Times.
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.980]   And God, I can't think of her name.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.700]   She's the real liberal columnist that always used to take down Bush so hard.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.700]   But anyway, she was interviewing him and said,
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:27.900]   tell me why on God's Earth would I ever use Twitter if I was in trouble?
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.060]   How would this help me?
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.900]   And he said, well, you could type in help.
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.180]   Four or five characters.
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:35.700]   Help!
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.100]   Help!
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.100]   Help!
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.100]   People have done that.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.100]   It actually happened.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:45.100]   Remember people have been arrested and tweeted as they've been called off to the go-
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:51.100]   My point earlier was more to the fact that if the communication networks that we rely
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:57.980]   on for regular access to services such as Twitter, if they fail like they would after
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:04.540]   catastrophic earthquake or a tsunami or hurricane, that's where the hams really, really become
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:05.540]   valuable.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:11.300]   When phone lines, cellular networks, and internet are gone, that is what is going to literally
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.300]   sit here.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.300]   Absolutely.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.580]   And frankly, it is a house of cards.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.580]   Let's face it.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:21.980]   As robust as we try to make it, this is not, you know, this is not that robust.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.140]   Hey, let's talk.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.620]   Let's put Denise Howell to work a little bit here.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:29.060]   Attorney, counselor, judge finds this is a little scary.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.020]   HTC guilty of infringing two Apple patents.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.140]   Does this mean Android is in trouble?
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.540]   Is this, are they going to get in a junction against HTC that keeps HTC from shipping
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.340]   phones to the US?
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.260]   Well, this is just one of the bigger pieces of how Android's in trouble, right?
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:51.940]   Because Android is just sort of a Swiss cheese of these patent and licensing issues.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:56.420]   Because at bottom, it's this open source endeavor based on Linux, right?
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:03.460]   And so everybody now that it's spreading and what's our other story here today, 515,000
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.420]   Android activations per day.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.740]   Yeah, spreading is right.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.060]   Like a wildfire spread.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:14.060]   So, you know, everyone wants to and can try and get a piece of that pie.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.500]   And so we see it coming at them from all fronts.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.260]   We've got Oracle, we've got Microsoft, we've got Apple, you know, and not just going after
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:27.020]   Google with Android, but this one, you know, Apple versus HTC.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:33.300]   And Neil, I tell as he has wanted to do has yet another definitive post unpacking this
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:39.300]   international trade commission ruling and basically, you know, throwing a bit of water
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.700]   on all the panicky coverage of it.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:53.020]   It was an adverse decision against HTC finding that two of the 10 patents asserted had been
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.540]   infringed.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:59.980]   But this guy is just the first stopping point in the ITC's decision making process, then
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.620]   goes to the full six member panel.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:07.900]   And so there's still a long ways to go in this, but I really encourage people to go and read
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:12.700]   Neil's post if they're fascinated by the details of all this over the next one.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:19.060]   HTC, in his post, one of the things he notes that HTC does say there are alternative situations
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:24.700]   solutions in place for this problem as if they have plan B.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.780]   Right.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.780]   What would that be?
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.180]   Well, that's a really good question.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:37.220]   I mean, I guess they're going to have to have functionality that doesn't rely on Android
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:43.180]   in its current iteration, right, that they actually have somehow coated around this,
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:48.060]   which, you know, again, another piece of this being an open source operating system, I guess
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.780]   you can do to some extent.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.860]   This makes me so mad.
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:58.580]   I understand Apple needs to do this, but I just, I don't know, in my heart, it makes,
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:02.980]   it just makes me mad because it feels like Apple just, just do your best.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:07.380]   Let Android do its best and let the best product win.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.660]   On the other hand, Steve Jobs says, Hey, we like competition, but if somebody is going
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.820]   to steal from us, we're going to go after them.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.020]   What are the patents exactly?
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.700]   I saw that there were two that were held up, right?
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.700]   One was one had to do with Denise, you've got to help me here.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:26.260]   One had to do with your clicking a phone number or anything.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.260]   Anything I wanted to get to you?
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.540]   I forgot to add a lot of this post.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.860]   It's a system.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:39.500]   The two patents, the first patent 5946647 describes a system of data detectors that
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:46.900]   can parse data, recognize known structures and take action upon them.
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:54.220]   Patent 6,343,263 is a patent that describes a modular system that enables different types
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.460]   of data to be processed in real time.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:02.320]   The point being, these aren't trash can clicking an icon.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:08.140]   These are fundamental underlying technologies that everybody does.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.900]   Everybody uses both of these technologies.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.900]   So what are the possible workarounds?
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.740]   Denise, does the ITC have to look at that?
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.700]   Do they have to take that into consideration or are they just ruling on whether this is
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.060]   original or not?
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:28.260]   I think that they're just looking at the patent and looking at the question of, is it infringed?
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.300]   I am not a patent lawyer.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:35.780]   You actually, on all about Android earlier this week, had Matt McCarrie on who's been
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:38.620]   on Twil a number of times.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:44.980]   He writes the litigating Apple blog and hasn't yet delved into this too deeply.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:51.260]   But I encourage people to listen closely to what folks like Matt and Nielai are unpacking
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:56.420]   about all this for the actual administrative details.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:01.780]   But my understanding just as a lawyer who practices in the IP area is they're going to
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:07.260]   be more closely concerned with the actual infringement involved in this narrow case.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:10.820]   So they don't have to think about, though, what is the impact of the market?
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.420]   Is this going to throw everything in turmoil?
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:18.060]   They don't have to think about end users who will have to all buy iPhones now.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:19.460]   That's not their perfect?
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.620]   The cost gets passed along to the user, right?
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.620]   I mean, in the end, all the cases.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:25.620]   All the costs in all the court cases.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.140]   It all comes down to what's licensed and what's not, right?
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:29.700]   I mean, that's what all these cases are.
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.900]   So ultimately, maybe this has resolved.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.620]   Apple says, "Fine, you could sell your phone.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.620]   Just pay us."
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.620]   Right, exactly.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.660]   But could Apple get that on the head?
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:43.060]   It's how much it's worth to them and how much they think they can push this without having
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:47.940]   to pay through the nose for the licensing involved in, again, because it's all this
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:54.260]   sort of strange brought together from multiple sources underlying technology, there's a
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:58.900]   lot of opportunity to debate what's original and what's not.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:03.660]   Could Apple be repacious, though, and say, "No, we're not going to license it," and
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:04.660]   put them out of business?
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.660]   I throw them like literally, too.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.660]   Isn't this what--?
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:11.300]   No, I mean, isn't this what it's all about?
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.060]   I mean, it's what it's all about.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.300]   It's how much can we push them?
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.340]   How much is they in our interest to push them?
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.860]   Do they want HTC out of business for some reason?
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:23.700]   I'm supposed--perhaps yes.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.700]   I mean, they're a huge competitor.
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.940]   Well, I think they'd like Android out of business.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:27.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.900]   They'd probably rather have a licensing fees.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:33.820]   I mean, how did Microsoft get so rich was licensing DOS all those years?
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:38.380]   I mean, you have just a steady stream of income from licensing.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.380]   That's what it's doing.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:43.060]   It just hurts me because I love my Android phone so damn much.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.460]   Do you love it so damn much?
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:48.060]   I'm actually physically in love with it.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:48.580]   I do.
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.220]   No, I love it.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.620]   Don't do an animated Jifon.
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.820]   No, no, but I do.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:52.300]   I love it.
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.260]   It's great.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:57.580]   It made me go back to iPhone and cry.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.100]   Yeah, I am right.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.140]   And it just makes me sad to see a company--
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.780]   well, I mean, I guess this is what happens,
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.980]   and he's your lawyer.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:08.100]   It seems to me that I would just like them to make a better iPhone
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.100]   and not worry so much about what Android's doing.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:12.620]   Right.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:16.060]   But they do-- they have these patents not just for their own technology,
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.220]   but for their future in a way it's an investment.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:24.620]   And it's standard operating procedure in the tech industry.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.980]   You know, I believe me.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.020]   I understand.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.380]   It just makes me-- it saddens me.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.540]   Yes.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:31.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:31.500]   It's frankly--
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.420]   It's venture patents.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:36.780]   It hurts open source software because what does the unintended consequence--
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.580]   maybe it is the intended consequence--
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.420]   is that people then start using proprietary solutions
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:45.580]   because at least they know it's not
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:49.700]   encumbered that they know who to pay a license fee to.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:53.740]   And it makes people scared about Linux and other open source software
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.100]   because, oh my god, who's going to sue me if I use this?
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.500]   Yeah, but look at the LODESIS thing, right?
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.340]   That company that owns the patent on the in-app purchasing.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:07.220]   And everybody I know who runs, say, an iOS app company
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.540]   has gotten a cease and desist letter.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.700]   And LODESIS has even sued.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.540]   - That's true.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.700]   - The York Times Company now.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:13.520]   - Apple, if they're smart,
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.760]   well, indemnify these companies.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:15.520]   I think I-- - That's what
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.620]   Apple's saying they'll do, but they haven't.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.940]   They haven't yet indemnified them.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:23.060]   And Apple's too busy suing everybody else,
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:28.020]   suing HTC, Microsoft or rather Oracle
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.180]   is suing Google over to Java.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.960]   And there's like 10,000 lawsuits this week.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.020]   A lot for Denise to talk about on our show this week.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.940]   - Bill in Michigan in our chat room, Denise asks,
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.260]   is it possible for--
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:43.680]   - This must be a technical term for a patent correction.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.900]   - A patent correction to amend a patent in some way.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:51.740]   - Yeah, to say, well, this really shouldn't be
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:52.580]   an Apple patent.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.620]   I guess the ITC doesn't do that.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.340]   - Yeah, no, they don't.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.420]   - They have to go with existing patent law.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.180]   - Yes, they take the--
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.780]   - And I love Cossus Belli in our chat room,
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.340]   Cossus Belli, who is appropriately named.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:08.020]   He says, Leo, don't hate the player, hate the game.
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.820]   (laughing)
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.500]   - And only in it-- - That's a niche.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.500]   - Yeah, well, it's kind of true.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.700]   - Only in the Twitch chat room,
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.660]   would you also get a comment that's streamed by it
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:19.140]   and see who said it, where they say,
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.660]   "Wonderful inside Linux joke,
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.860]   "all you have to do is get a license from SCO
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:23.900]   "and you're all set?"
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.740]   (laughing)
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.380]   - Yeah, SCO, just to ask SCO.
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.660]   - We know about SCO 'cause that went on for so long,
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.500]   it was kind of the-- - Oh.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.420]   - It was like the background noise of every broadcast
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.780]   we did for years.
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.140]   - That's right, I think this is gonna go on forever too.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.620]   Is this gonna be resolved in our lifetimes?
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.780]   The Apple, the Google, the Oracle, Battles, no.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.900]   But the costs will pass along to these.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.660]   - It would be possible at this point for Apple
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:50.540]   to ask for an injunction against Android handset sales
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.060]   or HTC handset sales in the US.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.420]   They could do that, could they not?
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.100]   - Yes, they can ask for it.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:01.100]   And it's sort of the big hammer
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.660]   that could come down exactly.
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:07.900]   The ITC does have that kind of power to ban sales.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:12.180]   So that's why these things are scary and worth following.
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:13.300]   - Right, that's not the next step,
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.340]   but it's a conceivable step in this process.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:16.180]   - Yeah.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.500]   - You don't get damages from the ITC, you get--
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.380]   - In junctions.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.580]   - You get market share.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.420]   - You get market share.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.500]   - Yeah, you least.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.740]   - Now, is there a backlash from the community
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.300]   saying Apple, you suck, maybe they're--
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.500]   - No, people love Apple too much.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.140]   You can't say anything negative about Apple.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:35.980]   - I can't.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:36.820]   - They come hammer you.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.580]   - I love this.
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:39.580]   - Do you ever been in our comments?
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:40.420]   - Check out my--
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.260]   - Do you ever sit late?
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.100]   - Say again?
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.820]   - You haven't been in our comments recently, clearly.
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.460]   - It is, it is a vicious battle
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.300]   between the Apple lovers and the Apple haters.
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.140]   It's still raging.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:50.980]   - It's a Leo.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.340]   Do you remember we used to play taps
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:57.180]   anytime the word Apple was mentioned on our radio chat.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.620]   - That was when Gil Emilia was running the company
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:00.380]   and I was right to do so.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.380]   - You were right to do so.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.580]   - Do you remember we had a button, a talk spot?
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.820]   - Who knew Steve would come back?
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.660]   I didn't know that.
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.500]   If I'd known that, maybe I wouldn't have played taps.
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.700]   I wanna talk to you a little bit about a great column
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:14.420]   in the Wall Street Journal by Ben Rooney,
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:18.660]   women and children first, technology and moral panic.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.840]   He's actually quoting Genevieve Bell,
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.820]   director of Intel's Interaction and Experience Research.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.660]   Well, I wanna talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:31.740]   The moral panic that society always goes through
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.100]   when there's new technology.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:37.180]   And who is it that suffers first?
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.860]   It's the women and children.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.460]   But before we do that, I do wanna talk a little bit
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.860]   about audible.com, my favorite place for audio entertainment.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:49.140]   I know you're listening to a twit right now or watching it.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.540]   But there are times when maybe you don't want this
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.020]   blather about technology.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.020]   You'd like to listen to a great piece of literature
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:57.860]   or enjoy a sci-fi novel.
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:00.460]   Perhaps get ahead on the Game of Thrones.
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.900]   Maybe you wanna re-clash a Kings before next fall.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.900]   That's where audible comes in handy.
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.860]   There are, nowadays we're so busy.
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.180]   Who has time to read anymore?
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.420]   But there are plenty of times when you could read
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.540]   if you could just listen.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.060]   You couldn't hold a book, but you could in the car
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.940]   or at the gym, cleaning house, walk in the dog.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.060]   I listen to audible books all those times.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.500]   In fact, sometimes I'll walk the dog three or four times a day
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.580]   just so I can catch up on my audible reading.
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.580]   This is that book I was talking about actually.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.700]   I'm feeling luckily.
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.980]   It's not Paul Adams, it's Douglas Edwards.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.300]   And the Confessions of Google Employee Number 59.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.540]   It's next on my reading list.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.420]   There's some great Google books if you wanna know more
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.220]   about Google at audible.com.
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.140]   And here's how you can get two of them for free.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.020]   You go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.300]   You'll sign up for the platinum plan.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.700]   That's the two Book a Month subscription.
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.620]   And the first month is free.
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:13:59.660]   Your first two books are free.
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.740]   You can cancel at any time.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.580]   Oh, nothing, but you get to keep those books forever.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.900]   This is one of the things I really like about audible
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.860]   is every book you've ever listened to audible
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.420]   is in your audible library.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.700]   And you can listen to it at any time.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.220]   I use the Audible app on Android.
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.220]   There's one on iPhone that lets you literally browse
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.660]   through your library of books and listen to them.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:19.820]   And see this new feature?
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.740]   I love to send wirelessly to Kindle.
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:25.100]   You can send audio books.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.500]   I just sent Solaris to my Kindle.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.420]   How about that?
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:31.860]   So you can read the book and listen to the book.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:35.580]   Plays on the iPhone, iPod, iPad, Zoom,
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.500]   pretty much all of the media players.
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.700]   Of course, your computer as well.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.580]   Even on my Sonos, which is great.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.540]   When nobody's home, I will make the Audible books
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:46.340]   resound throughout the house on my Sonos system.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.580]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.740]   Pick two books.
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.140]   Gina's got a couple of books on here.
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:52.980]   I was?
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:53.940]   Yeah, well, there I was.
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.420]   Isn't your other book on here too?
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:56.260]   I was.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.100]   This should be on there.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:57.940]   I know I was.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:59.460]   It should be on there.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:02.540]   My new book, which is The Mountain Within.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.060]   The Mountain Within.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:06.380]   I'm not sure if that's on there, but I bet you it's out to me.
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:07.820]   Is the Mountain Within out?
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:08.660]   It's out.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.500]   It came out this week.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.500]   The same week, Bite came out and I didn't even have time.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.340]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.180]   You didn't tell me that?
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.020]   It's so busy.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.380]   Your book came out?
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:16.980]   My book came out this week.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.540]   No Audible version.
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:19.940]   Gina, we got to work on that.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:22.180]   It'll be, I'm sure it is in the works.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:25.900]   But I was is there and it's great because I got a guy who sounds just like Wozniak reading
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:26.900]   it, which is hysterical.
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.940]   Yeah, he sounds exactly like it.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:31.820]   What's The Mountain Within about?
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.380]   I wrote the book with Hertovon Stegel.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:35.380]   There's a word for you.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.020]   Hertovon Stegel.
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:42.500]   And Hertovon Stegel was a former chairman of AIG Europe and she has been taking people
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:47.620]   up Kilimanjaro, people who are physically challenged and are mentally challenged.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.140]   And so my agent came to me and said, Hertovon Stegel has written this book, Kenya Wozni
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:55.540]   write a bunch of leadership lessons attached to this.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:16:01.820]   So it's like plan your journey, deal with criticism.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:07.340]   Don't stay too long at the top is the final lesson in the book.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.340]   So it's a business book?
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.340]   That's awesome.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:13.580]   It's a business book and it's an adventure book and I wrote it for Hertovon.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.580]   Well congratulations.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:17.660]   And if you look down at the song, I don't even think my name's on there for some reason.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.660]   It's a typo.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:21.580]   You're not a ghost though.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.580]   I'm not a ghost.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:23.580]   You're not a ghost.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.340]   You're a real honest to God.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.500]   Write a co-author.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.500]   Ghosts are writers too.
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.940]   But I mean it's just for writers you need to eat.
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:32.940]   They're imaginary writers.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:33.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:36.100]   Yeah, because you just know you can't say you write the book.
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.100]   So we'll give you two books.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:41.340]   We'll give you Douglas Edwards, the I'm feeling lucky and I was.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.340]   How about that?
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.820]   Both free.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:47.620]   Although I have to say if you start browsing around it's going to be pretty hard to limit
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:48.620]   it.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.860]   And if you're watching all of my books, start listening.
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.900]   A world of wonderful literature awaits you.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.820]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.540]   And Patchett, I love her.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.940]   She's got a new novel out.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.940]   She's great.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:02.940]   I loved her.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:06.240]   What was the one where they're holding the people hostage?
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.940]   It's like the Stockholm Syndrome?
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:08.940]   Yeah, I loved it.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.980]   Yeah, that was one of my favorite novels ever.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:16.820]   They've got all the people held hostage and they're in Venezuela, Peru or something.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:17.820]   Now I can't remember the name of the book.
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:18.820]   I can't remember the name of the book.
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:19.820]   I can't remember the name of it.
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.820]   I will look that up.
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.820]   I'm going to do it.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.820]   I got the Google.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.300]   What's the name of that book?
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.780]   I'm sure it's on Audible too.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:26.780]   Belkanto.
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.780]   Belkanto.
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.740]   Because it's an opera singer is in that.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:31.740]   That's right.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:34.780]   There's an opera singer and she gets in with one of the kidnappers and teaches him how to
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:38.020]   sing and it's a beautiful book.
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.020]   That should be an Audible.
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.980]   Let me just check because that would be fun to listen to.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:41.980]   What a great book.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.940]   You know, if I've read a book it's because I listened to it on Audible.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.500]   In the last 10 years that's the only books.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500]   So this is another one we could recommend.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.500]   Yeah, the characters.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.500]   Love this book.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:56.820]   University of Iowa after the dot com crash for the summer taking a novel course and they
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:59.300]   recommended that everybody read Belkanto.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.300]   It's beautiful.
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:05.700]   So I loved this column and I thought since we have three female panelists on here it'd
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.700]   be great to ask you what you thought about it.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:10.620]   I don't know if you read it in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.940]   But it's the issue of the word of moral panic.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:19.620]   Genevieve Bell says we have had moral panic over new technologies pretty much as long
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:25.060]   as we've had technology since fire in the wheel.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:30.580]   And it's always she said played out in the bodies of children and women.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:34.740]   She says look at the pushback about electrifying homes in the US.
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:40.380]   She said if you electrify homes people said you'll make women and children vulnerable.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:44.420]   Children's will be able to tell if they are home because the light will be on and you
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.660]   will see them.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.660]   Real ways.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:51.420]   Can you see them before with the lantern and the window?
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.300]   Railway coming out of the chair.
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:57.860]   Railway trains, women's bodies are not designed to go 50 miles an hour.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.860]   Their uteruses will fly out of them.
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:04.300]   That's the quote of that article by the way.
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:05.300]   Whoosh.
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.300]   Wish.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.300]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.300]   There's an animated GIF for you.
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:13.340]   The uterus is flying out of women.
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:17.260]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:20.860]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.940]   Today will be a successful day if my uterus doesn't fly.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:27.780]   No, I do remember though we thought that man could not or woman or children could not
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:31.700]   go faster than say 30 miles an hour because it was just your body would scramble, would
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.700]   turn them to jelly or whatever.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.940]   But I think this is happening right now.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.940]   Whenever we want to regulate the internet, we say it's for the children.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:41.940]   Protect the children.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.540]   Child pornography we're trying to save.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.460]   I don't know if women are blamed anymore.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460]   I don't know.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.460]   I think it does.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:50.460]   Go ahead.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:56.300]   It does seem to be the leading justification for turning things off or clamping things
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:01.900]   down that go more broadly of course than the immediate concern.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.540]   The first pushback she says is going to be about kids.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:08.540]   Is it making our children vulnerable to predators, to other forms of danger?
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.220]   We will immediately then regulate access.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.940]   I just thought this was very, very interesting.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:22.540]   There's no question that there's always a huge societal panic every time.
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:24.740]   There's a new technology.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:28.540]   I mean you remember who are all those people that were screaming about the internet when
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:31.140]   it first started.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:33.940]   This is the show of not being able to remember people's names.
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:39.980]   That guy started an entire movement against the internet in the late 90s.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.060]   What was his name?
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.060]   I don't remember.
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.060]   I didn't remember that guy.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:45.060]   Do you remember that guy?
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:46.060]   We had him on the show once.
[01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.060]   We did.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.060]   He was saying, we did.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.060]   We had him on the show.
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.580]   Why did we dignify him?
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.380]   Because it was the hot thing to talk about.
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:56.660]   He was saying, oh if the internet comes out, people will stop reading.
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.460]   Not an entertain.
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:01.460]   It happened.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.940]   That sounds suspiciously like Andrew Keene.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:07.460]   I think Andrew has backpedaled quite a bit on his.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:10.980]   He was the guy who wrote the cult of the amateur.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.820]   He said all these amateurs, all these amateurs.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.900]   They're just flooding the world with bad crotch videos.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:19.620]   That's why we had a war with you guys.
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:22.540]   That's why we were a nation of amateurs.
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.300]   All of those cat chips.
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.500]   I can't take it anymore.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.300]   But there was a book that came out a couple of years ago that was about the telegraph.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:37.900]   The whole book was about how people were freaking out because suddenly there was a
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.900]   Victorian internet.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.700]   You remember the book?
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.180]   Finally, somebody remembers something on this shit.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:48.900]   So Hotmail has, Microsoft has responded to all, apparently there's a rash of people hacking
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.340]   Hotmail accounts.
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:55.340]   So Microsoft's response, they now have a button on an email that says, my friend has been
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.340]   hacked.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:01.660]   This is the fix.
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:05.860]   You get an email from your friend that's obviously from a bad guy pretending to be your friend.
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:12.420]   You now have a button you can push that literally says, my friend has been hacked.
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.420]   That's hilarious.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.180]   What genius came up with that?
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:20.900]   It sounds a bit like my friend is a communist.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:21.900]   Turn him in.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.900]   Turn him in.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.900]   My friend is.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.420]   He's a red.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.420]   That's very funny.
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:31.620]   My friend has been hacked.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.700]   That's the best they can come up with because all their employees have left to go to Google.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.700]   They can't fix it.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.700]   So we're just going to.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.700]   Or Apple.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:38.700]   Yes.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.700]   Yes, they can't fix it.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.860]   I think we're scraping the bottom of the barrel of the stories here.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:43.860]   So just apologies.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.780]   Well, you didn't talk about the new tablet from Amazon.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.780]   Okay.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.780]   Let's talk about that.
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.780]   That's a good story.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.780]   No, I thought it was a rumor.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:51.780]   We don't know for sure.
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:58.020]   But Amazon reportedly making a nine inch tablet running Android color.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.340]   Yes, it's an Android color tablet.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.340]   It's not much of a rumor.
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:06.620]   I believe that there's a shiny manufacturer came forth and said, yes, we're designing
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:07.620]   it.
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:10.100]   But nobody in Amazon has admitted this.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:12.620]   I mean, they didn't deny it.
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:16.420]   And as all reporters know, when you don't deny it, that's not true.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.940]   It must be true.
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.740]   So what do we think is Amazon going to be a big player in the tablet market?
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:25.500]   Is this going to I mean, tablets are not selling the only tablet that sells right now is an
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.500]   iPad.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.460]   Everything else is a, you know, distant second.
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.900]   Can Amazon turn that around?
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.700]   Maybe it's like the Kindle three or the Kindle four or five.
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:39.540]   They just add a whole bunch of functionality and leverage the market they've built there.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.220]   But one of the things that makes the Kindle so good is that it's not color, that it's
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:44.220]   eink, right?
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:51.580]   I mean, if you make it a color tablet, then it's just another bad iPad clone or no.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:52.580]   I agree.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:56.900]   I mean, I think it's really hard for these tablet wars to get going because the tablets
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.420]   that have come out have been so bad.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:02.780]   You've got that playbook, which has one redeeming feature.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.820]   It's camera and it's video camera.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:05.820]   Oh, it's a play book.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.020]   It's really terrible, terrible.
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:08.660]   But otherwise it's all.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:09.660]   Terrible.
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.660]   I bought one.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.300]   I actually paid $500 for that piece of junk.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.940]   And it doesn't end the bridge just came out, right?
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:18.940]   The ability to actually.
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:21.540]   It only came out so I can get email on this week.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:24.620]   Yeah, now you can have email after you paid $500 for it.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:29.700]   The HP Touchpad is out now and we've got a tester Brian Burgess in Minnesota.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.180]   Who is my executive editor?
[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.060]   He says, I want to like it.
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:34.380]   I want to like it too.
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:35.380]   I do.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:36.380]   I hate it.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:41.460]   Yeah, apparently the underpunter powered and underpowered thick, heavy, big fat.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:47.180]   I mean, you know, they all have a better camera than the iPad, but they're not going anywhere.
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.180]   Any of these tablets.
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.180]   What's how about this?
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.180]   Here's a story.
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.060]   Sony's got a new tablet too.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:55.420]   I can't get excited about it.
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:59.220]   I think it's the iPad through the end of the year, then maybe.
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.220]   Maybe.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.180]   There's no apps.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.180]   How about this?
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:08.060]   A woman publishes a book filled with this is what you should have done, Gina.
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.820]   I was thinking, why do you think I do?
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:14.700]   Why write a book when you could just take 12 years of personal text messages?
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:15.900]   It's called Text Me Up.
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:25.660]   Tracy Mobley, Moberley has taken 10 years of her texts and she's made it a novel.
[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:28.060]   I don't know.
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:29.060]   All right.
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.060]   Well, you know, there's, there's some.
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.780]   I'm telling you, I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:32.780]   I got nothing.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.020]   So she's publishing other people's texts as her book?
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.020]   No, it's her.
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:37.020]   Her own.
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.020]   Her own text.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.020]   No.
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:40.020]   You're right, Denise.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:41.020]   Text she's received.
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:42.020]   Uh huh.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:45.860]   Oh, when she left to talk on Twill about, you know, what?
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:51.780]   You know, what you have to have to have a copy writable work and whether tweets are copy
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:52.980]   writable.
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:56.580]   I think that you could make a good argument here.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:59.580]   You know, I'm sure she probably changed names, but.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:00.780]   But she doesn't know.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:01.780]   She's got content here.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.380]   She didn't write incoming texts.
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.180]   They don't, you don't own them.
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:06.180]   No, right.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:07.180]   I'm, I'm.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:08.180]   They were, they landed on her.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:11.860]   She could have started to copyright it by sending them, by sending them to her.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:14.100]   I have, I didn't give her a license to publish.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:16.660]   I don't think you gave her a license to write a book.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:17.660]   No, I think you're right.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:18.660]   That's a good point.
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:19.660]   Very interesting.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.940]   No, there is a, you remember Julie Cameron?
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:24.620]   Julia Cameron read a book years ago.
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:28.220]   It was all about, you know, unleashing your inner creative being.
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.620]   And the idea was that every morning you would write these morning pages, you wake up at
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.180]   the morning and then you just kind of write stream of consciousness.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:39.740]   And then there were all these books that came out of publishing their morning pages.
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:43.180]   And then of course there was a guy that came out with all those tweets.
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.060]   And then they based a show around it with William Shire.
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:47.820]   Oh yeah, tweets my dad.
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.300]   Pooped out or something like that.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:51.300]   So now this.
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:53.100]   So, you know, it's just a matter of time.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.100]   Next, it's Google groups.
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:58.780]   Twitter is, by the way, officially five years old.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:00.580]   I made good news.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:02.380]   July 15th, 2006.
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:03.380]   Do we care?
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.380]   Happy birthday, Twitter.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:05.380]   Happy birthday, Corey.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.380]   Corey?
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.380]   Happy birthday, honey.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:09.260]   And it was just a couple of days ago.
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:10.260]   Happy birthday, Corey.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.500]   Is he the same age as Twitter?
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.740]   I don't think he's fine.
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:16.140]   Sometimes he seems that way.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.660]   Internet years he's the same age as Twitter.
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:19.660]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:20.660]   Corey, time back.
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:21.660]   Corey, the great Corey doctor.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.660]   He's definitely better out a little longer than Twitter.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:23.660]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:25.620]   Corey is, of course, Jenny's co-collaborator.
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:26.620]   I didn't know that.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:29.180]   Co-conspirator on boing, boing.net.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:30.180]   I didn't know that.
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:32.340]   Oh, we love Corey.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.500]   Big fan of Corey, doctor.
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:36.340]   The only reason Corey is not a regular on Twitter is because he has to put Posey to
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:38.980]   bed at this time.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:39.980]   We try to get him all the time.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:42.220]   He says, "No, I'm sorry I got to Posey to bed."
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.220]   I love it.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.220]   How old is Posey?
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:45.220]   I don't know.
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:46.220]   What if she--
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:47.220]   She's about the same age as Twitter, actually.
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.380]   She's just about, I think, four years old?
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:51.380]   Four or five years old.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.380]   I was going to say a little younger.
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:53.380]   Best name.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:54.380]   But they're like--
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:55.380]   She has the best name in the world.
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.380]   That is the best name.
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.180]   Oh, it's not-- but it's only part of it.
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:27:59.180]   Best name.
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:00.180]   Her whole name is even--
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.180]   It's a long name.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.180]   Yeah.
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.180]   I wonder if I can find it.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.180]   Let me see if I can find the whole--
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:06.420]   He announced it when she was first born.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:10.660]   Posey Emeline Fibonacci Nautilus Taylor Doctorow.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:11.660]   Lord.
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:13.660]   Everybody should have Fibonacci as a woman.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:14.660]   It shouldn't have.
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:15.660]   Fibonacci.
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.020]   Posey Emeline Fibonacci Nautilus Taylor Doctorow.
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:19.300]   But Posey's such a nice name.
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.300]   I like Nautilus.
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.300]   I think pretty much.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:23.300]   Nautilus.
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:30.140]   Folks, we are-- we are-- we are-- this is the last show for Twit, for the Twit show,
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.500]   from the cottage.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:34.900]   At this time next week, we'll be broadcasting live from the Brick House down the street,
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.700]   brand new Twit Brick House Studios.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.380]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.580]   There is still time to get a brick on the wall of honor.
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.700]   We have-- we're selling bricks to help raise money for this incredibly expensive product.
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.300]   You can get an 8 by 4.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.660]   You can get an 8 by 8.
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:49.220]   You can get your logo, whatever you want.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.180]   Go to bricks.twit.tv there.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:52.660]   I've plugged it.
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.100]   It helps us a lot.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:57.100]   And actually, I got to tell you, when you come in the door and right there in the entry
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:03.780]   lobby, all of these bricks with all of these amazing, you know, thoughts, wishes, in memory
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:07.220]   of-- it's just really inspiring and really exciting.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.780]   It really gives you a sense of the Twit community.
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:12.060]   So if you are part of the Twit community and you want to participate and help us build
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:20.100]   our brand new facility, bricks.twit.tv, everybody should read Boing Boing religiously, because
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:25.540]   it is the best and should follow Jenny Jordan on Google+.
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:28.340]   I'm still on Twitter too.
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:29.500]   And Twitter, why not?
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:32.100]   One of the things I like about Google+, though, is you just use your real name so it's easy
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.100]   to find people.
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:36.340]   I don't have to say @Jenny or anything like that.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:38.540]   Jenny Jordan, she's on Google+.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.540]   It's easy.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.620]   Look for the animated cat gifts.
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:43.900]   You can't miss it.
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:45.100]   You can't miss it.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.980]   Jenny, thank you so much for watching.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:48.980]   I've been participating.
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:49.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.980]   I don't know what you--
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:51.980]   I've also been watching.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:52.980]   Watching and listening.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:53.980]   We appreciate it.
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:58.460]   Gina Smith, congratulations, the launch of a book and a magazine all in one week.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:29:59.900]   I don't know how you do it.
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:00.900]   Yes.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:05.020]   The bite cast, we announced both bite and the bite cast.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:10.820]   And if you go to the page called "Bite Is Back," I believe it's called or "Welcome Back
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:12.900]   Bite," there's a big video of Uleo.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:13.900]   Oh.
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:14.900]   "Welcoming Back Bite."
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:15.900]   You're on Bite.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:16.900]   I think I reported that.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:17.900]   I must have.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:18.900]   You did?
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:19.900]   Oh good.
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:20.900]   They're at the cottage.
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:21.900]   All right.
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.900]   I didn't just steal it or anything.
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:23.900]   And look for the book on Amazon.
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:24.900]   What is the name of the book again?
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:30.740]   The book is called "The Mountain Within" and the magazine was just BYTE.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:31.740]   It's back.
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:39.020]   I think nobody has ever come on Twit with more stuff to plug in the history of this show.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.260]   310 episodes than you today, Gina.
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:42.260]   Congratulations.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:43.260]   Thank you very much, sweetheart.
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.660]   I can't wait till our-- we start our bite cast.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:48.700]   Bite cast coming soon to the Twit Brick House.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:49.700]   We're going to get a brick.
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:50.700]   Thank you, Twit, and he's hell.
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:54.620]   A host of This Week in Law, you hear it every Friday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:56.060]   at live.twit.tv.

[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.140]   Great to have you.
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:00.140]   Thank you.
[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:05.740]   I'm going to pour myself a glass of nappa chardonnay in order of the farewell to the Twit Cottage.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:06.740]   I know.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:10.160]   I mean, we're going to be here for another week, but this is the last show this week in Tech
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.160]   Show from here.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.160]   Sad.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.160]   So thank you all for putting it.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:15.780]   I'm really looking forward to seeing my brick on the wall.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:16.780]   That's going to be fun.
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:19.140]   Let me tell you, this new place is so beautiful.
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.460]   You're just going to love it.
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:21.460]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:22.860]   We really appreciate it.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:27.420]   I'm going to leave you with Tom Merritt and look at the week ahead on our TNT show every

[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:45.500]   This is the last time I will say it in the cottage.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.500]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.500]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:49.940]   Here's a look at the week ahead.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:52.620]   Some of the stories will be covered on Tech News today starting today.
