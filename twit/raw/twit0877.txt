[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.800]   Andy Inako.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.120]   Somebody stole Seth Green's board ape.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.480]   Uh oh.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.960]   A problem with the new anti-trust bill.

[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.840]   Hi Georgia!
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.040]   Hi.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.400]   I'm going to do, I've watched your How to Be a Better listener.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   Oh good.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.640]   I'm sure it's completely coincidental that you did it the day before you showed up here.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.640]   Right.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.880]   It was just a coincidence.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   Yeah of course it was.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.640]   It wasn't aimed at anyone.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.760]   Well alright, but I'm going to do my best to listen to you this week.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.600]   No more interrupting.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.040]   Anyway, it's great to see you.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   Welcome.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   Why are you wearing a Hellfire Club t-shirt?
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.760]   Okay, so this is for my next video, which is going to be a Stranger Things video.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.040]   So I painted it myself.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.240]   I'm really proud because it's going to turn out really well.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.400]   But I think it turned out pretty bloody close.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.040]   I thought it was such a good question.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   Yeah I thought this was a compliment.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   Such a compliment.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   Yeah, very fancy.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.240]   No, I actually put the sheet of paper underneath the iPad brightness on and then I traced it
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.680]   and painted it all through.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.480]   It was a relative nightmare, but I think it turned out pretty much.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.240]   Just for future reference, what kind of ink do you use to paint a t-shirt?
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   Acrylic.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   It won't wash out.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   Nope.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.880]   You do have to be a little bit careful if it's very thick.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.320]   It might crack, but I wash them by hand after.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.520]   And I take it, Hellfire Club has something to do with Stranger Things.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520]   It does.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.320]   Alright, oh in fact they have apparently Hellfire Club t-shirts in Stranger Things.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.080]   Okay, so there's a reason.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.280]   Oh yeah, that's sorry.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   Yeah, there's a reason.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   That's been bad.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   Okay, I didn't know.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.200]   You're wearing this as their t-shirt for their D&D groups.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   Ahhh, got it.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.040]   So, yeah, so they're wearing it.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   Awesome.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.440]   Great to have you.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.160]   Also with us, he's a regular on WGBH in Boston and on Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   on this network.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.800]   Andy and I go, good to see you.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.240]   Good to see you on a weekend.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.280]   We never get to see you on Sundays.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.760]   Yeah, you have to see me after seeing lots of Sunday comics and had a good diner breakfast
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.560]   and even a two-hour walk in the sunshine and then a half hour pass out after I realize
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.240]   it, oh my God, it's now like 88 degrees and humid.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.480]   It hasn't been let away for eight months.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.040]   Any day in which you can get in a nap is a good day, I think.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   Exactly.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   That's my best way to do it.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   What would an app you wake up from?
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.480]   Yeah, well, let's be clear.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.480]   Good, yes.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.120]   Important qualification.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.600]   Mission accomplished.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.360]   Also here from Consumer Reports, he's their technology reporter, the great Nicholas De Leon.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.760]   Good to see you, Nicholas.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.920]   Hey, Leo.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.120]   Thank you for having me.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.840]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   Really good to have you.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   I guess we have to start with Seth Green's board ape.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.400]   The story of the week.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.920]   Seth Green has apparently a fairly large NFT collection and he has created a TV show based
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.040]   on his collection called White Horse Tavern.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.080]   The show according to Buzzfeed is based on the question, what if your friendly neighborhood
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.600]   bartender was board ape yacht club number 83.98.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:07.240]   And by the way, even though it is an NFT, I'm going to display a picture of board a 93.98.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.680]   You do not own this.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   You're just seeing it.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.320]   Do not get confused.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.600]   He is a sad looking blue eyed ape, smoking a reefer it looks like.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.960]   But it's one way that there's a filter tip.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.200]   So it must be as crumpled up cigarette.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.000]   He has a halo and he has a skeleton T-shirt.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.360]   And in fact, if you look, that is his property.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.880]   Purple Bonti's sad brown halo board unshaven.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.200]   So why is this important?
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.600]   Well, notice at the top reported for suspicious activity.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.560]   Apparently, Seth Green got fished.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.200]   And I'm not sure, but I'm going to guess this has to do with a common problem people
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.360]   have with NFTs.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.840]   You have a public key, which you can give out.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.360]   You have a private key, which you should never ever under any circumstances reveal.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.160]   Apparently, some scammers got his private key and stole stole, I tells you, board ap.yacht
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.040]   club number 30, 83.98.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.680]   We found out we found this out, by the way, at the big V con conference, Gary V's NFT
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.440]   shilling conference last weekend in Minnesota.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   So he says, and I think the law is unclear, that because his ape was stolen, he no longer
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.920]   has the copyright.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.600]   And the whole show is up in the air.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.640]   It was purchased by somebody who then sold it on for $200,000 to a doctor in Australia
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.760]   who goes by the handle Darkwing 84.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:52.360]   $200,000, he bought it for, put it in a vault called GBE vault where it sits today.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.120]   Seth has been trying to get ahold of the guy.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.440]   The guy says, I'm not giving it to you.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:05.400]   It's really unclear on what happens now to the whole cartoon show.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.840]   Some say that if Seth makes the show, he'll be sued by Darkwing 84.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.960]   Some say Seth could go after Darkwing 84.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.080]   All that's happened so far is that OpenSea has put a little thing on it so he can't
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.520]   sell it forward, reported for suspicious activity.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:30.120]   I would have never heard about the show anything if not for his NFT being stolen.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.040]   Like this is the best thing for the show because I wouldn't have heard of it.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.360]   I wouldn't have wanted to watch it.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.680]   Yeah, I think it's probably worth the $200,000 just that time.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.680]   Could be for all we know.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.880]   I mean, I think there is a speculation that a lot of NFTs are sold kind of by the owner
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.320]   to the owner anonymously just to pump up the value of it.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   Interesting.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.240]   By the way, I'll stop calling him 83.98.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.440]   His real name is Fred Simeon.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.440]   There you go.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.800]   Yeah, it's not as nefarious sound.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   No.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   It's not exactly a Bond villain sort of thing.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.880]   But how many of the problems of NFTs does this point out?
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.560]   If we're talking, when NFTs first became a thing, I was very intrigued by it because
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.040]   there's all kinds of digital art that can't really enter the art market the way that anything
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.600]   that's actually not simply made out of electrons can manage.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:38.120]   If you've ever gone to a really good city art museum, you can see there's some rooms
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.400]   where no, the TV screen isn't the projector, isn't the artwork.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.040]   It's the video that was created for this artwork and the interaction between the persons and
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.680]   these sensors as part of the artwork.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.640]   It's intriguing to see how far this can go, but it's not going to go that far if these
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.840]   artists can't plug into the same phony, baloney, hyper-inflated, non-transparent payment and
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.080]   investment platform, that traditional art is put in.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.520]   That's a great thing.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:16.560]   How can you imagine if an Andy Warhol, if the Warhol that sold for $12 million last week,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.520]   it got stolen and then sold to somebody else and then sold to somebody else who now has
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.520]   it.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.040]   They were able to establish the chain of who bought it from whom and where it is now.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.600]   Then the person who originally got it stolen from, he'd say, "Well, that's great, so get
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600]   the guy."
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.120]   No, wait a minute.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.080]   We found out where it went.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.120]   Can we go over the first guy who's do bought stolen property?
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.560]   No, because it's no present for this.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   We didn't plan for anything.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.200]   No one knows what they can do.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.360]   All we planned on here is how we can charge people money for these things.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.640]   He did give him the information, right?
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   Yes.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.040]   It's kind of like he gave him the money.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.520]   So he said, "Please give me the money."
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.280]   He said, "I know your mom.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.480]   Your mom wants the money."
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   But like, so I don't know.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.880]   There's no laws that are...
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.720]   A bank is not liable if you give money to somebody on the street or give them their
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.040]   pen, they're not liable because they didn't...
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.040]   It wasn't fraudulent.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.880]   Well, I don't know.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   There's a lot of questions about this.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   It's still fishing.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880]   Although...
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880]   And also...
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.280]   The good news is the NFT, you made an excellent point, Andy, which is unlike, say, a stolen
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.920]   Andy Warhol, the provenance, the chain of possession is public.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.360]   Everybody knows who had it.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.200]   Who has it now?
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.960]   And the other component is that the idea that this is one of those rare NFTs or one of
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:42.560]   those alternative NFTs where you're not only getting the electrons, but you're also getting
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.840]   commercial rights to the thing.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.400]   And now we have to figure out, okay, does that actually transfer with the theft or did
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.040]   the contract stay with Seth Green, even though the item itself has been stolen from him?
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.360]   So could he go forward with this?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.640]   And with the person who has it in his possession, who knows he's got stolen property, would
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:14.120]   they have the absolute guts to sue Seth Green for making a TV show out of a character whose
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.360]   property was he stolen as a property?
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   And no one...
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   That's a good point.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.480]   No judges didn't go to law school 80 years ago and sent the Supreme Court for 40 years
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   to decide stuff like this.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.560]   They wanted to design freedom and liberty and rights.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.080]   And this is not what Justice Brandeis spent his time deliberating.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.280]   I don't think this is high on their interest rate.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.000]   Do you own any NFTs, Nicholas?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.560]   Do I own any NFTs?
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.720]   I think I bought one as like an experiment just to do it, just to go through the process
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   of doing it.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   But I'm not silly.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.680]   Is it a monkey that wears a halo?
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   Tell me.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.640]   No, I think it's one of those loot ones where it's just a text of like the, you know, oh
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.200]   a sword, a bag of coins.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.920]   So it's just that text.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.600]   But it cost me like $200.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.680]   I did want to add that we did a story a few months ago at Consumer Reports on crypto wallets.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.440]   And I only bring that up just to say, because, you know, I don't know what the Seth Green
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.520]   and what the details are, but just to highlight that this stuff is still kind of hard to use,
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   pretty unscrewedable.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.480]   And if you're like the average person out there, like I, you know, I don't know that
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.040]   I feel bad for Seth Green.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.880]   But like there's so much spam and so much fishing.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.520]   This whole scene is so like so shady.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.280]   It's just so user unfriendly.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.960]   You know, it's no wonder that we're 10 plus years into Bitcoin and it's still kind of
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:46.160]   this like experimental thing, you know, where it's not a mainstream tech yet.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:52.280]   I have to say more and more, I become kind of hostile to crypto and especially to NFTs
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.680]   because it really just seems like mostly it's people getting suckered.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.680]   You know, some people are making a lot of money, but if you're making a lot of money,
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.320]   it's because somebody else gave you a lot of money.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.520]   Yeah, this is like playing stock market in 1918.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.520]   This is like playing the stock market in 1918 before.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.920]   Okay, everything crashed.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.240]   Everybody's destitute.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.880]   We're going to start to have some rules because trusting people to do the right thing and
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.360]   not over inflate things to justify their own share, that isn't working out for the world
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   economy.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.000]   Georgia, what did you want to know?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.640]   Do they own the name as well?
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.480]   Couldn't Seth just like kill off the character and have it like, you know, resurrected as
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.680]   another animal wearing a halo?
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:38.240]   Well, that's the other interesting point of that because some NFTs are being created by
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.760]   the artists who are making the art.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.800]   It's a way of kind of supporting the artist and you're not, you know, with a digital print,
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.360]   what you know, you can't say I own the one copy of it.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.440]   It's digital.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.800]   So maybe that makes sense in that context.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:59.720]   But this, like a lot of them, like the original zombies, like Kevin Rose's owls, they contracted
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:06.200]   with some poor artist who drew a thousand board apes, got paid, whatever he got paid.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   And that was that.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.400]   And now really all of the money, it's not has another to do with the person who designed
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   it.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.680]   So I kind of feel bad for the guy who did Fred Simeon who drew it because he's thinking,
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.200]   yeah, Fred Green's going to do like a national TV show based on my creation.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.040]   I'm not going to see a penny of it.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.560]   So this is really all kind of the aftermarket, not the artist.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:34.400]   The artist is, you know, worked for hire in this tell tell, say that to also all the writers
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.720]   and artists who've been writing Marvel comics for the past 20, 30 years, we've got paid
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.000]   like $800 for a story that became the basis of a $1.8 billion movie.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.360]   Yeah, that's a really good point.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.280]   You probably don't go to Marvel cinematic universe pictures.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.800]   Hey, guess, guess what?
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.560]   Who's getting two tickets to the premiere?
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.480]   You are going to own absolutely.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.080]   I don't know.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.480]   Just sign that just signed, sign this thing on the back of the ticket in order to use it
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.760]   that says that you make you will not actually so it was an anytime for any reason.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.680]   I sometimes I feel like I'm just a boomer.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.120]   You know, they say, okay, boomer.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.640]   You know, Larry David on the Super Bowl.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.080]   Remember, did that ad where he did?
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.560]   I was never going anywhere.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:21.400]   And they, I guess I'm that guy, but I am very skeptical about this whole thing.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.320]   I no longer see a real value to any of it, including Bitcoin, by the way.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.920]   Well, again, that was just like NFTs.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:35.320]   When it was first put forward, the reasons for having cryptocurrency were so well founded.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.360]   The idea of having a currency that is not tied down to any nationality or any actual
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:48.560]   bank, the ability with one of the one of the use cases for it was relief organizations
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.760]   trying to get relief funds to people who absolute who were basically in poverty.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.120]   Excuse me, parts of the nation where parts of the world where poverty is random, food
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.600]   is food is scarce.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.240]   Where if you send actual relief checks in through the national banks, well, guess who
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.280]   owns the national bank, the same person who is who has been putting these people into
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   poverty.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   Right.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.280]   Into hunger.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.400]   Whereas if you basically say we're going to create an economy inside the section that
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:21.800]   is based on this United Nations cryptocurrency, basically, and if you were in a nation where
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.920]   that is in a state of constant collapse, where you feel as though at any moment now your
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.040]   currency is your savings is going to be nationalized, that's all this.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.440]   These are all reasons.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.880]   And to say nothing of people in this world who don't have access to banking.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.320]   I mean, we take that for granted, even in the United States, there are people who are
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.440]   living and working and contributing to our economy who don't have access to banking,
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.760]   who would be able to make transfers from person to person without having to pay exorbitant
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.560]   fees through whether it's a really well-sparker or whatever.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.080]   So but again, suddenly you turn this into this bro-investor opportunity and now you've
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.560]   basically ruined it.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   It's terrible.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.720]   That's a very good point.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.440]   I hadn't really thought about that.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.840]   Well, we just, it may be one of those things that happens all the time in technology where
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.800]   the early years are very weird and unpredictable and there's no, nobody understands what's
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   going on.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.520]   And then at some point it settles down and regulations are conceived and it starts to
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.640]   become more orderly.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.160]   It's possible.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.480]   At this point, I would not buy an FTFR review.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.400]   Let's talk a little bit about the new California bill.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   This is the new thing.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.200]   There's Texas started this way saying individuals could sue abortion providers or even somebody
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.920]   who drove somebody to get an abortion.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.880]   A new California bill could allow parents to sue social media companies for up to $25,000
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.760]   if their children become addicted to the platforms.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:02.120]   Now it's not a law yet, but in this day and age I could easily see this becoming a law
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.720]   in California.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.120]   I'm sure you talk about, do you ever talk about internet addiction, Georgia?
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.280]   Or what do you think of that notion that people could get addicted to social media?
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.760]   They are addicted to social media.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.360]   I don't even have my teens.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   Like even, they won't tell their parents this, but even my teens will say that they are 100%
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.080]   addicted and use way too much time on the internet.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.600]   It's, that's what it's made for, right?
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.800]   Like they try to get you hooked up to be able to, this is what makes you feel good and your
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.240]   value is dependent upon how many people liked the latest thing that you did.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.640]   So I think that it's, it comes with a huge cost.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   So should there be a law that lets people sue for addiction?
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.120]   Like should I be able to sue Twitter or actually it wouldn't be Twitter, it'd be Instagram,
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.120]   right?
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.800]   Or, or Snapchat that my kid just can't put the phone down.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.120]   Or, you know, even something like TikTok, like just even media that people are using.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.320]   It's, but I don't think that you should be able to, I don't think that you should sue
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   them.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.960]   It's the same thing as like, you know, being like government being able to, well, in like
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.840]   Canada, being able to sue tobacco because of the amount of Medicare costs that it costs
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.680]   the government to be able to cover.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.680]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   It's a different thing.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.560]   It's a much more direct line of kind of attack and they already knew the cost to that versus
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.720]   social media.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.960]   You know, it's, it's one of those things that I think that kids shouldn't be on it is like
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.520]   you want to wait as long as possible to have your children on social media because it does
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:33.120]   create the same kind of addiction as a gambling machine does that on and off reward makes
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.400]   our brain just go wild.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.120]   And it's really hard for people to get off of it.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.880]   Like there are so many like, like, you know, 70, 80 year olds that are the same thing,
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.080]   like once they're on, they can't get off again.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   Even politicians and people that we know and billionaires, they're on Twitter and they
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.680]   can't stop tweeting and you're like, just put down, put down, stop someone take away
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   the phone.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:03.400]   So is it ultimately the fault of these companies that design these algorithms to be so sticky?
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.520]   I think that yes, they, they, they spend, they, they, they hire people like me to be able
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.800]   to make their systems as, you know, like, like, you're doing it on purpose.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.080]   Like they're doing it on purpose because you're all like our amount of attention is
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.680]   finite and we can only be on one social platform at a time.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.480]   And so because of that, they're trying to fight to make it as addictive and a salient
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.520]   and having people on there as much as possible because that's really how they make money,
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.880]   being able to see what we do and what we click and what we don't click.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.040]   It's not really about using the device, but it's about finding out where we go from what
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   device, right?
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.960]   Like Facebook makes most of its money, not from us being on Facebook, but on being able
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.880]   to track where we go and why we're going there.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:54.720]   So it's no different than Purdue Pharma selling OxyContin and encouraging physicians to over
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.000]   scribe OxyContin knowing people will get addicted.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.200]   Are, is, is like Instagram and, and snap at TikTok, are they, are they the Purdue farmers
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.840]   of social?
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.960]   I, I actually do believe so.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.480]   Like I don't think that they, I think that they come with some, like a lot of good and
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.560]   you can send out information and you have direct access to people and it gives a lot
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   of people a lot of power.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.360]   So I don't think that it is just a negative, but just like, you know, using OxyContin or
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   something else, if you are an extreme pain, it can also be very beneficial.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.080]   I don't think that it should just be, we can't just throw out the baby with the bathwater,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:32.480]   but I think that us not knowing that it comes with a severe cost and that like even people
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.320]   that work in these large companies, they will themselves say that they know that they are
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.960]   causing social damage as well as great benefits, but we can't just say that it's only good
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.520]   and we can't just say that it's only bad.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.140]   So I think that it should be, you know, looked into, I think that it should be legislated.
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.280]   I think that if they're tracking us, we should know what they're tracking and why, you know,
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.680]   who are they sending all of this information to?
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.760]   How is it being used?
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.360]   How are we being manipulated?
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.880]   It's kind of the shadiness for me is more about us not knowing there is no transparency.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.600]   And if you take a look at their, you know, try to read through all of the legal leads
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.080]   of all of their privacy policies, it's really difficult to be able to navigate even if you
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.960]   have a law degree.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.920]   Yeah, I mean, you could also accuse Starbucks of foisting caffeine, Starbucks of foisting
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.280]   caffeine on us, Nicholas, right?
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.000]   I mean, they're, they, they are in a business where they know, they know perfectly well
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.680]   they're, they're making a somewhat addictive product.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.240]   That's the beauty of it from their point of view.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.200]   No, this is stuff we discussed internally.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.400]   Like, you know, let's say we're reviewing the new iPhone, we're, like, are we by giving
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.040]   the iPhone a good score when the camera is great?
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   Excellent.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.160]   We're being into, you know, just kids, just endlessly scrolling through Instagram or just
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.720]   spending all day in Discord.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.600]   Like, should we, should we take that stuff into account when we evaluate, you know, the,
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.840]   the pixel, the pixel six or whatever?
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.840]   I don't know.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.200]   But it is stuff that we're, we're thinking about, like, to what degree I didn't Tim Cook
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.000]   say a few months ago that he doesn't want to encourage like mindless scrolling on your
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.200]   phone and just think about like how many people are just mindless.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.480]   I mean, but he still wants you to be on the phone.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.480]   By the phone.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480]   He still wants you to have the phone.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   He just doesn't want you to mind.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   He doesn't make any money from the scrolling.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   Don't be my ass.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   No, it's great to you.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.960]   It actually, it's really great necklace that the consumers union thinks about that.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.120]   I thought I from time to time wonder if I'm culpable because I mean, we talk about all
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.520]   the shiny new objective objects and we're always reviewing them and talking about them
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   and ways to use them.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.560]   And, you know, my career as a tech journalist really has been to some degree to foster people's
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.280]   usage of these objective devices.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.680]   I struggle with that too because it's like, go ahead, Nicholas.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.840]   Oh, I was just saying it's like, yeah, it's, is it, is it my role to say, oh, this iPhone
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.600]   is awesome, but don't use it because Facebook is bad or don't use it because Instagram is
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   addictive.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:55.440]   I don't know what my actual role there is and that sort of transaction, but we are, we
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.600]   are, we're not ignoring it.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.280]   We are thinking like, what role do we play here?
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.760]   Should we, should we tweak?
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   Should we not?
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   Should we just leave it as is?
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.680]   You know, I'm not, I'm not announcing anything today, but like we're thinking about these
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.160]   things that you see, that you don't necessarily think of consumer reports like unnecessarily
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.760]   weighing in on, but we're, we're thinking about it, I guess.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.240]   You made a good point, Georgia, because all of these things have some benefit.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.280]   It's not that they're completely without merit.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.920]   Even casino gambling is entertaining.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.720]   You know, Starbucks keeps me awake.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.760]   I mean, if you're great pain, oxygen is a good one.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.760]   Right.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   But it's that knowledge, right?
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.600]   Like, I think that like shows like this and, and like you're learning also knowledge
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.560]   about like that media comes with certain costs and how do you know when you're dealing
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560]   with it?
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.160]   And I think that that is what should be taught in schools.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.680]   Like there's certain subjects like our school system, our education system hasn't changed
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.480]   much in like hundreds of years, like the subjects that we're teaching, which are important,
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.400]   but like we need to learn about like becoming media savvy about, you know, how is media
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   used to be able to manipulate us, how easily we are manipulated.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   What are the good and bad?
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.120]   How do you know if you're addicted?
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.080]   Like there's a lot of information that we need to be taught at a much younger age.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.600]   And when people watch shows like this and read articles about media, they're learning
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.440]   about the good and the bad of that, which I think is really important.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.120]   Because I don't think that most people know, and I think that when you're young, they don't
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.800]   really know how addictive that is, how it's actually changing the wiring of your brain.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:31.080]   And that's like once you start working through addiction centers really quick at a very young
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.840]   age, they become really strong.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.440]   And some people have addictive personalities where they're already inclined to be able to
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.640]   be addicted to that dopamine center, which makes us feel motivated and excited.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.240]   It's all those bells and whistles that happen in our head when you, you know, win a jockpot
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.800]   or, you know, open up some tasty treat on your video game and get the best card that
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.200]   you're supposed to have.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.720]   So if we knew about that, I think that we would make better decisions.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.040]   I mean, I'm addicted to spaghetti.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:01.440]   That doesn't mean it's, it's Jeff Boyardee's fault, right?
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.680]   I mean, humans are by nature addictive.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.880]   We love stuff and we sometimes love it to our detriment, Andy.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.720]   But I think it's the same.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   Let's go ahead, Georgia.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.560]   Oh, I was just going to say, is it the same though, right?
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   Well, it is.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   I mean, you clearly can see the side effects of being addicted to spaghetti.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.960]   It hasn't been good.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.560]   The landmark decision against the tobacco companies points the way towards every sort
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   of law about this about addiction.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.160]   It wasn't so much that they were selling an addictive substance.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.840]   It was that they knew how addictive it was.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.600]   They were intentionally adapting the product to make it more addictive.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.960]   And they were actively denying and disproving that it was addictive to their, to their customers.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.440]   So that, that really put the responsibility right in their lap.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.520]   Do you think the social networks do the same thing?
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:28:01.160]   I definitely, I definitely think they, I definitely think they know why, why, I think that they,
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:07.000]   why slot machines in 2022 based on digital technology work much differently and much
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.240]   more efficiently than the ones built in 1953.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.960]   They understand when to disrupt our rational centers.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.400]   Obviously, Georgia will talk better about this than I can.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.880]   So I'm, I'm, but nonetheless, I'm concerned about laws like this.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.760]   I'm not so concerned about this one.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:30.120]   Rather, I wasn't as much as I was after I read the law itself because it does appear
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.840]   to, what it, what it does is that it doesn't simply say we are going to punish you if you,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:42.560]   if you're a service and you meet some extremely vaguely defined way of mishandling your, your,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.720]   your, your child customers and making them addicted to stuff.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:51.320]   It basically puts some guide posts into what qualifies for, for this sort of relief, but
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.720]   more importantly, I think is the section that basically says that by the way, you get a,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:01.560]   you get a complete get out of jail free card if you just do the two thing, these two things.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:07.520]   If you do quarterly audits of how your practices could be addicting children and then if you,
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.320]   whatever you find that can be, that seems to be addictive, if you remedy this within 30
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.800]   days, again, you get, you get a get out of jail free card.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.120]   So I think that from my reading of this, he said not being a lawyer, it does seem as
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.680]   though the thrust of this is not to open up the gates to all kinds of lawsuits, but to
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.880]   basically say, look, we are, it's not enough for us to simply put into the law that you
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.640]   are required to do quarterly audits and remedy things within 30 days.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.440]   We're going to put this rule in place as a way for you to get the escape clause from
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.120]   a whole bunch of hurt that you want to be able to.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   That is good.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.920]   That just, that just pushes them to be to do some responsible reporting and accounting.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.920]   And I think that's good.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   I think that's good.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.960]   So yeah, now that you, I didn't read the law.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.760]   Thank you for doing your homework.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.560]   Now that you say that, I'm not so against it.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   I think that's not such a bad idea.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:00.160]   I think it could still be a bit more specific, but the wording basically points out to,
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:08.200]   hey, addiction, not limiting, including, but not limited to like depression as diagnosed
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:14.640]   by a professional self-harm, all kinds of other things that children are vulnerable
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.200]   to in a state of addiction through social media.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.680]   And there's no question about that happening, right?
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   I mean, we hear about it all the time.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.000]   There needs to be some liability I do.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   I do think.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.840]   But as long as you do it carefully and don't basically torch an entire platform, because
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.680]   in addition to causing harm to kids, social media in allowing very isolated kids who think
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.560]   that they're the only person who are like this, they're the only people who are suffering
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.400]   these problems to find their tribe, to find their people out there who can they talk,
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.080]   they can talk to when they don't feel as though they can talk to any of the adults that
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.080]   are in their lives.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.240]   There's no number, there's no numerical index to how much that has helped children over
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.040]   the past 10 or wherever many years we've had social media.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.000]   And we don't want to disrupt that.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Right.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.080]   Georgia, you would not let your kids use Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or TikTok, but you would
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:08.160]   let them strap on a visor and play virtual reality games all day.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.920]   And I wouldn't say that I won't let them use that social media as long as they use it
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.200]   responsibly and they understand what they're doing.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.480]   And if I catch them that they're not using it responsibly, it's a different story.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.600]   Like you're addicted to VR.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   You're addicted to VR.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   Let's admit it.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   I love your.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   It's not actually very addictive.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.400]   VR is a little bit exhausting, right?
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400]   You wear it for a while.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.200]   You actually want to get out because you're tired.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.400]   Your eyes are strained.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   It's heavy.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.840]   It I would love to be more addicted to VR.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.080]   Unfortunately, it is I'm like after 45 minutes to two hours, I'm done.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.080]   Like that's I'm like good.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.880]   I need to take a break.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.880]   That's good.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.120]   Because of that, it has its own effect that you don't really have to worry to it.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.200]   I think that social media targeting kids is different than being able to be used by kids.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.640]   I think that it's like the camel cigarettes where they had this little cartoon character
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.000]   and they realized that if you don't start smoking by the age of 18, you're probably never
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   going to smoke.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.760]   And so they were like, oh, let's make sure that we grab kids when they're young.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.440]   So they start smoking so we can make our money.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.120]   And then the government's kind of went down on it and having cool packaging.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.360]   It works so well for us.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.920]   We all think that we're not going to be able to like get attracted to being able to use
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.680]   something that's flashy and snazzy looking and that all of our, you know, people that
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.040]   we looked up to are using.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.240]   But we are all very easily manipulated by these things.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   That's what we need to learn that.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.120]   Here in California, there's a, you know, we've got a primary election coming up in a couple
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.840]   of days.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.120]   And there's a big battle going on.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:39.960]   You see ads all the time on TV saying, don't let these online gaming apps, I think they're
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.240]   going after DraftKings, FanDuel and all that stuff.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.600]   Don't let these addict our children and cause great harm in society.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.680]   But it's being paid for by the Indian casinos in California.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:59.760]   And every time I see it, I think, yeah, don't let them addict your kids.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.840]   We want to do that.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   That's going to be our job.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.680]   They can't do that to our pigeons.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.320]   Only we could do that to our pigeons.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:14.080]   It's, there seems some hypocrisy there.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.160]   It's a little, you know, a little strange.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.880]   But on the other hand, who's responsible if you use something to access?
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.400]   I mean, everything in our lives can be used to access it somewhere or another.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.920]   Ultimately, there has to be some for adults, some personal responsibility for kids, some
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.760]   parental responsibility or not, Georgia.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   I think so.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.720]   I think that it really is up to parents.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.800]   I think it's also up to our education system as well.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.560]   Like I think that, you know, we should be electing people as officials that will end up
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:51.400]   making our education system so that, you know, it's going to be giving the best education
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.360]   that there is to our kids so that they end up learning about, you know, media knowledge
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.080]   about, you know, what happens inside the brain and what doesn't because it's, it's really
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   important.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.280]   And I think that for some parents, it's, you know, it's an easy thing to say that it's
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.600]   parents' responsibility to watch their kids, but especially with the way that the economy
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.320]   is, there are many people that have to work one or two jobs to be able to support their
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.320]   family.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.600]   And so they're spending more time at school than they are at home.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.240]   And it's an easy thing to say that parents should be able to watch their kids all the
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.720]   time, but it's really hard for a lot of families and especially right now.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.680]   And so I think that we need to make sure that we are enforcing that an education system
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.760]   is going to be teaching the kids the lessons that they need to be able to survive and
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.840]   have all of those different skills and know the pitfalls that are coming forward because
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.560]   we need to teach them really early.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.960]   And I think that we really have let down a lot of kids about not learning about finance
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.280]   and not learning about what type of media and the way that advertising works.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.600]   And, you know, the way that fear makes us be able to give up our privacy and our rights
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.120]   so effortlessly.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:02.480]   And it's almost, I mean, look, we're always have always been surrounded by addictive stuff.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:09.160]   We tried, you know, in the term at the earlier part of the 20th century to ban alcohol.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.360]   That didn't work out so well.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:16.120]   Yeah, banning is such a horrible idea though in comparison to teaching people the effect.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.480]   Like I don't know about banning, like banning seems to do the opposite, right?
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.280]   Like just saying no to something, like saying no to drugs is a very ineffective method to
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.920]   be able to stop people from actually using drugs.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:35.240]   And I think the 20th amendment didn't really work in eliminating.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.040]   There's a fountain downtown from the Women's Christian Temperance Union.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:45.080]   It was put in around 1909 that says something like abstinence is the only solution to the
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.080]   drinking problem.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   It's etched in us.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.840]   It's right next to one of our finer bars.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.480]   And I think the idea is from the Women's Christian Temperance Union here have some water.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.280]   Don't go in there.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.480]   Have some water.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.480]   And it's still there.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:07.080]   I think it's a fabulous monument to a good and principal idea and an absolutely failed
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.760]   process, political process.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.040]   We also have a brewery in San Francisco called the 21st Amendment Brewery, which is the repeal.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.920]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   We've got a great panel.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.680]   It's so nice to see you, Georgia Dow in her handmade t-shirt.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   It's so cute.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.120]   It's like Dolly Parton in the code of many colors.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.400]   Only it's hellfire, but it's, you know, it's close.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   It's close.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   I don't understand.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400]   I don't know if I want to understand.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.360]   You can look it up while I'm doing the end.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.200]   Andy, Andy, Andy, not go.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.660]   Is also here.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.820]   Love to have Andy on.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.000]   Of course, every Tuesday, we're going to have a lot to talk about in a week.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   The WDC is coming up.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.240]   We'll talk a little bit about that today.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.480]   Let me just tell you, Lou, anytime you want to compare me with Dolly Parton in any way,
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.120]   shape or form, I would be flatter to sell.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.360]   I can't imagine ever be offended by being compared with Dolly Parton.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.360]   She is the same.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   She is our Mr. Rush.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.760]   Your sister, Jolene and I, go probably would have something to say about it.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.520]   Also, Nicholas De Leon, it's great to have you from Consumers Union.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:10.480]   He's their senior electronics reporter, the Consumer Reports magazine, which I am proud
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.480]   to say.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.480]   Thank you, Lou.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.960]   I have been a member of Consumers Union and a subscriber since I think 1980.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   What is that?
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960]   42 years.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   A long time.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.320]   That's older than I am.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.880]   We appreciate your support.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   Thank you.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   That's our own.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.480]   I've got subscriptions older than you.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   It's funny.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.200]   We've got in the walls in the office, all the magazines from issue one, issue two, and
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   all the...
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.600]   Oh, it left the CZ in the actual office.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.000]   The first consumer's report would be very interesting.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Where were they reviewing like...
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   I don't remember.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.880]   The funniest one I remember, there was an issue in the...
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:54.400]   I believe it was the 1960s where they looked at mixed nuts and like the laws regarding
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.880]   the percentage, what could be cashews, what can be peanuts.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.640]   It was apparently a whole thing back in the day.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.880]   But that's the funniest one I can remember.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.320]   Keeping us honest.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.320]   Yes.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.440]   Yes, since whenever.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   What was it?
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.520]   How old is it, I wonder?
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.520]   What's the first one?
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   1936.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.520]   I think.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.520]   36.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.520]   Something.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   Maybe they will have it somewhere.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.960]   I want to find the first consumer reports magazine.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.080]   I think that would be fascinating.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.480]   Fascinating stuff.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.480]   Our show today brought to you by Zapier.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.320]   I am a happy, happy Zapier user.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.120]   Have been for years.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:38.160]   Zapier automates the boring stuff so you don't have to do it over and over again.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.600]   Streamline your routine operations tasks.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:47.720]   Ready up your time.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:39:09.840]   Connect all your apps.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:34.120]   Let's go to Zapier.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:42.160]   Zapier, the cool thing about workflows because you can connect almost any app to almost any
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.720]   other app.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.960]   It's really kind of amazing.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:51.480]   They come with a bunch of sample zaps, stuff that you might want to use.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.760]   But it's very powerful.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:00.440]   I don't think there's anybody who has more connections to more apps and tools and so
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.840]   forth than Zapier.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.280]   You connect your apps.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.360]   You can move data.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.880]   You can copy data.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.400]   You can process data.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.080]   It is just an amazing tool.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.720]   What I love about them is they've been very good about helping people get started.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.440]   They've got videos.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.960]   They've got samples.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:30.280]   Here's more than 4,000 different apps that you can connect with if then statement.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.800]   If something happens on Instagram, I can automatically save it.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.040]   It's a drop box or move it to an on and on and on and on.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.760]   It's just no limit of what you can do with Zapier.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.120]   I want you to give Zapier a try.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:51.520]   Go to zappiers.com/twit.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:57.180]   If whether it's business automation, personal automation, no coding is required.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.240]   Anybody can do it.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   4,000 of the most popular apps businesses use every day.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.560]   Google Sheets.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.200]   We use QuickBooks, Facebook, Google Ads.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.760]   That's really the only hard thing about doing this ad is thinking about how you might want
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.760]   to use it.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.960]   Start to think about what would you do?
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.160]   For instance, a new client comes in.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.840]   You make sure you add them to QuickBooks.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.960]   You add them to your CRM.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.240]   They have thousands of easy to use templates.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.840]   You can get them started right away.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.840]   On average.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.840]   This is the other thing.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   I get an email from Zapier saying how much time I've saved every week.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   On average, the average user saves $10,000 in recovered time every year.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.440]   1.8 million people and businesses use Zapier to streamline their work, find out, find
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.480]   some more time to do the stuff that you really care about, let Zapier automate the boring
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   stuff.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.040]   See for yourself why teams at air table and Dropbox and HubSpot and Zendesk and thousands
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.000]   of other companies use Zapier every day to automate their businesses.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.440]   It's the best tool ever.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.440]   I almost want to just take you and say, "Look, look what you can do."
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.000]   But maybe the best thing to do is try it for free.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Zapier.com/twit.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.320]   Z-A-P-I-E-R, Zapier.com/twit.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   You'll find a way to use it.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.160]   You'll find a hundred ways to use it.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.840]   For home automation, the sun goes down.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.040]   My lights come up.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.040]   Things like that.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   It's a little bit more comfortable.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.040]   Zapier.com/twit.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.040]   Let's see.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   Back to the show.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:42.000]   There is, speaking of bad laws, they're both Texas and Florida have social media censorship
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   laws.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.320]   Florida has very famously exempted Disney until the governor of Florida decided, "I
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   don't like Disney.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   They're a woke company."
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.520]   They actually took them out of the law.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:01.680]   The Ninth Circuit Court has, I'm happy to say, blocked the Florida law.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.440]   Of course, the Fifth Circuit unblocked the Texas law.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.800]   It's not clear what the courts are going to do.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:14.080]   The Eleventh Circuit came in response to a lawsuit brought by NetChoice and CCIA.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.320]   These are the same people who sued in Texas.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.520]   The court found that Florida's argument that social media giants are not entitled to First
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.520]   Amendment rights does not hold up.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.640]   The court wrote, "Not in their wildest dreams could anyone in the founding generation have
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.680]   imagined Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or TikTok."
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.800]   We were just talking about that.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.760]   But whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever advancing technology,
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:47.280]   the basic principles of freedom of speech in the press, like the First Amendment's
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:53.960]   command, "Do not vary when a new and different medium for communication appears."
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.000]   We're going to have a little bit of a collision because the Fifth Circuit lifted the injection
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.040]   on Texas' law.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:11.360]   The Supreme Court has not issued a decision, but Justice AlleOdo upheld the Fifth Circuit.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.800]   No, wait a minute.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   That hasn't happened yet.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.840]   The Fifth Circuit lifted it.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.080]   We haven't heard from AlleOdo yet.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.440]   AlleOdo is a mayor, San Francisco, sorry.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.880]   AlleO, former mayor.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:29.080]   I think it's Justice Clarence Thomas who is the Justice for the Eleventh Circuit, so he
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.520]   might also be expected to weigh in if they appeal.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.800]   Andy, you sound like you have something to say.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:45.080]   No, just that it's, if we're looking for some good news in this, it's that the decision
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.600]   that basically said, "No, you can't do that," was extremely well reasoned and extremely
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.560]   well explained and the foundations were extremely carefully laid out.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.520]   Unlike, by the way, the Texas courts, the Fifth Circuit's courts, which seemed to think,
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:04.680]   "Confused YouTube," didn't think YouTube was a website.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.920]   I don't know if they even really explained their decision, basically saying that it was
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.600]   okay for this to go forward.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:19.920]   Basically, they didn't make it easy for this to resist a further injunction in the future.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.000]   Again, not being a lawyer.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.440]   I've never had so many people in my rolodex who are like lawyers and like Washington
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:33.720]   wonks to advise me on how this stuff works than I have in the past five or six or seven
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   years.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.800]   But it's not over yet, but it's very, very dangerous.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:43.920]   I mean, God help anybody who lives in a state whose governor wants to be president in two
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   years because they're going to be doing some wacky, wacky stuff in your state.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.960]   And that's exactly what's happening in Florida.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.960]   Nutty.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:56.320]   I mean, there really is the opinions of the people I was talking to about this was that
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.360]   the governor knew and the legislature knew damn well, this has very, very little chance
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.480]   of standing up to any scrutiny whatsoever.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.280]   And it was just basically there so that they can get that notch on their belt and they
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.200]   can campaign on it in the midterms and in the presidential election.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   I think that's true.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.120]   The Texas bill as well.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.320]   It's really posturing.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.880]   It's about it really, I mean, let's face it.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.280]   It's really saying you can't ban Donald Trump from Twitter is really what this is all about.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.840]   I mean, there's there's stuff there.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.080]   There are laws very, very high on the pyramid that have always explicitly maintained and
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:35.160]   upheld the idea that you can't you can't treat YouTube as a corporate entity as somebody
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.080]   who's shouting stuff into the streets and have to be held responsible for the stuff that
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.720]   they hope that they that they shout in the street.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.360]   That is so well established that you're going to have to come up with a brand new trick in
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.320]   order to assault that in any way, shape or form.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.840]   This is why oftentimes like five out of seven, like really, really scary legislative tech
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:58.120]   stories that you see coming through, you can basically dismiss because all you have to
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:03.840]   do is check paragraph one, paragraph two to say it has a okay, it's been proposed, but
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.480]   has it made out of a committee has it moved forward at all.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.760]   There's so many of these nutty laws that you just senators and Congress who they just
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.160]   want to hear themselves talk.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.940]   They just want to be able to put something in a newsletter or on a mailing card and they
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.480]   know this isn't going going to go forward.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.240]   Sometimes though these things do go forward and that's why they have to be publicized,
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.760]   they have to be talked about and combated because this would be super, super dangerous.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:31.160]   I was saying that the California law about suing companies for a social addiction of
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.120]   kids was okay, when you look at the law, it doesn't look so bad.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.040]   This law is just bad.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:41.780]   This is basically saying that every company that allows a allows an individual citizen
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:46.920]   or entity to speak on the internet has to serve the needs of the state, whatever the
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.840]   state just deems those needs to be.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.960]   If it doesn't cowtown to those needs that they can basically be shut down.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:48:01.760]   This is not something that amendment number one on a constitution is equipped to permit.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:07.520]   The Texas law says the First Amendment should treat social media companies less like a newspaper
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:15.760]   and more like a railroad, a common carrier, which is a railroad or a bus or an airline
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:22.920]   or transportation company that offers their services to the general public.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.880]   The problem is of course you remember a few years ago that was the argument for blocking
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:33.760]   net neutrality laws which is that ISPs were not common carriers.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:39.720]   It's a very complicated landscape we live in and I think it's more, I think you make
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   the point Andy exactly right, it's more about political notches on the belt than it is about
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.520]   actual sensible legislation.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.520]   We'll see.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.960]   I mean any of these could become a law at any time.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.920]   It's just unknown.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.440]   There was a law I was kind of excited about.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.440]   Senator A.B.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:03.320]   Klomashar's bill, she and Chuck Grassley pushing the American Innovation and Choice
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:10.120]   Online Act which I interpreted as kind of a data portability act.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:16.840]   A new version of that bill was released this week which does only a couple of things,
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.600]   really make sure that the bill doesn't apply to telcos and on financial companies who of
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:28.680]   course are big donors to the Senator's campaign.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.360]   This is the thing that's always quite amazing.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:36.160]   It's a bipartisan issue, the base of the idea of applying antitrust in a more thoughtful
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.440]   way towards large tech companies and everybody wants to break up Google, everybody wants
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.520]   to force Apple to allow side loading of apps, rah, rah, rah, absolutely.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.400]   It's time to let these get these people down at top notch.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.840]   But when you say that's great, I'm so glad you're on our side on this because there are
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:58.160]   communities where you're not allowed to have competition in selection of broadband providers
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.440]   or phone providers.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.680]   So you definitely want to break up that monopoly.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.000]   Oh no, no, no, not that one.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Exactly.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.640]   There's a ton of monopolistic companies.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.120]   We don't want to touch them.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.520]   Sometimes that is spare.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.520]   Let's see.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.040]   What else?
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:23.360]   The Dr. Go, a little heat on Dr. Go.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:30.520]   And I think probably rightly so, Dr. Go has promoted itself as a privacy first search engine.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:40.240]   But they have also released browsers and it turns out that the Dr. Go browser on mobile,
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:46.080]   according to security researcher Zach Edwards, while it does block trackers from Google and
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.320]   Facebook, allows Microsoft trackers to continue running.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.160]   Here's Zach's tweet.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:02.840]   And then Dr. Go admits it saying, yeah, well, that was part of our deal with Bing.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:08.520]   Dr. Go CEO and founder Gabriel Weinberger confirmed their browser intentionally allows
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:18.760]   Microsoft trackers third party sites due to a search syndication agreement with Redmond.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:28.240]   So we're working hard to, Gabriel says, we've been continually pushing, but Microsoft says,
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.160]   no, so what can we do?
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.880]   Well, you can tell people about it and still letting it tell people about it.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.880]   Tell people about it.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.800]   You're the researcher having a security researcher put a meter on your app to find out who it's
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.320]   talking to.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   That might help.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.880]   It would have been nice if they've been.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.720]   Yeah, it is because I like that.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.720]   It's so disheartening.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.720]   I loved it.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.720]   I was like, oh, I'm so happy.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.720]   I used it.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.120]   I supported it.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:56.240]   And then to hear it's when you find out, I think that Andy, you're absolutely right.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:01.400]   It's when you find out they didn't share this information upfront, somewhere in their hidden
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.160]   in their privacy policy, somewhere where we could read about it.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:09.920]   And then you're like, because then it's one of those things that once you trust something
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.400]   and you give something, you trust, then you find out that you should enough, then you question
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.720]   everything else about it.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.960]   And then people are like, oh, well, you might as well just use Google, because at least
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.360]   we know that they sell everything.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   I'm going to.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.040]   At least they're honest about it.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   Well, you know, you know, Weinberg's statement to bleeping computer basically said, well,
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.720]   but we still block the other guys.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.480]   It's still better than most.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   Just be forth right.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:42.360]   If you're going to say we're a privacy forward company, then when you when you aren't doing
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.800]   it, you need to tell people.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   I think that's exactly.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   I just want to jump in.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.880]   I know some folks who work at DuckDuckGo and they feel like they're one of the good guys
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.880]   in this kind of space, which is not a great space anyway.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.200]   But like, yeah, this feels like communications.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.960]   It's like you can't, you can't.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   Oh, but it's Microsoft.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   We're trying really hard.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.960]   I don't know.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.680]   They just come across kind of.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.040]   It's kind of sad, I guess.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:12.800]   You think it was because if they had said upfront, we're going to block stuff, but because we
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:18.600]   use Bing, we can't block Bing and LinkedIn trackers.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.280]   That's part of our deal with Microsoft.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.600]   I could see why they may not have wanted to say that out loud, but you're going to get
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.800]   caught, Nicholas, right?
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   You're going to.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.000]   Well, we don't know what what if Microsoft's it's like a national security letter.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.600]   You can't even acknowledge that this exists.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.240]   Like Microsoft put like restrictions on what they couldn't say.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   Oh, maybe.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.240]   You don't know.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.600]   But yeah, I do think that in this case, if they have just said it, even if they just
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.840]   buried it in like you said, in just a privacy policy somewhere to have it come out this
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.520]   way with a security researcher who then puts you on blast and then it looks like your
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.760]   tweeted statement is kind of like, well, actually, you kind of come across a little
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.800]   bit defensive and it doesn't look great.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.400]   Even even if you're what you're saying is true is like, hey, look, our hands are tied.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.400]   Like I get that.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   I'm an adult.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   You can tell me that.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.760]   But they do come across a little defensive and like I said, I know some folks there and
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:14.040]   they are they are pushing hard in this space in terms of like user rights and privacy.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.800]   So they're they're I think a force for good in the internet privacy conversation.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.880]   But in this particular instance, yeah, they come across a little a little weird.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.320]   So we step on a rake like that.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.720]   I mean, yeah, stepping on a rake is a good description.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.680]   But Nicholas, I think you're right.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.160]   We should at least give them credit for doing something.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.880]   It's better than nothing.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.320]   And I hope they learn the lesson.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.560]   I think they are now saying something about it.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:49.840]   They updated the description of the browser and the app store and the Google Play Store.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:55.880]   It originally said tracker radar automatically blocks hidden third party trackers.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.680]   The new description.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.760]   Well, it doesn't say except for Microsoft.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:08.480]   Now says automatically blocks most hidden third party tracking scripts.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.520]   See notes and link below for more information.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.400]   So they're at least they're kind of admitting it.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.640]   It's still in the fine print.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.920]   Give them some credit for doing something, I guess.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   Absolutely.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:24.040]   I mean, Firefox blocks everything, including Microsoft stuff, right?
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.040]   I use Firefox.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:30.440]   I turn on all the blockers I put on other stuff, additional stuff.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.680]   I am more concerned.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:37.280]   I used to, and I've mentioned this before, be a little more sanguine.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:41.040]   I don't mind if my information is shared with advertisers.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.880]   That seems not so dangerous.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:50.040]   But then we're starting to learn that government is using this in states like Texas, where
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:56.520]   I could be sued, if I in any way support abortion.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.840]   And now my location data is being sold to anybody.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.600]   It makes you a little bit more aware.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:10.120]   You're particularly, we should be particularly concerned about geofence warrants that have
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.920]   always been a huge, huge problem.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.720]   The ability for law enforcement simply say, "Hi, Google.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:21.000]   We want just every single device identity of every phone that was within this vicinity,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   within this radius on this data."
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Yeah, I hate that.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.200]   That's such a fishing expedition.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.720]   And unfortunately, this is something that Google and Apple are big enough to fight these things.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.680]   And basically say, "We're not just going to simply rubber stamp this thing.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.760]   You're going to have to absolutely get everything correct."
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:43.240]   But once the right files have been filed, they have to hand this stuff over, which is
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:49.560]   why I think last week was a 30 Democratic Congress people basically signed a letter saying,
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:55.400]   "Google, Google, you need to do something to protect this abuse of geofence."
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   This is particularly to protect people who are seeking abortions or at least pursuing
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   abortion.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:05.880]   Because that's how they're going to be DA's that are, again, they want to be elected to
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:11.920]   that next level up that are going to be seeking and encouraging abuse, persecution and abuse
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:16.880]   of anybody they think might be even considering such an action.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.480]   And it's just going to be horrifying.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:23.080]   I know a lot of people that are getting rid of their period trackers for the exact same
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.080]   thing.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   Yes.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   Right.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:34.080]   I do believe, I think it's Google and Apple are starting to ask for better privacy protection
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.600]   for things like that.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.760]   But we know that at least several period trackers are selling information on to third-party
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.760]   data brokers.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.760]   It's terrible.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.400]   Oklahoma is considering a law that's the most ridiculous of them all.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:56.280]   That basically says, "Oh, by the way, life begins at conception."
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:02.120]   And that, I mean, I don't understand how women can remain free in a state that decides
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   that, "No, I'm sorry, I'm going to get off of the tension."
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:13.440]   The problem with that is that then-contraception becomes an issue because almost all contraception
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:19.560]   will stop the egg from being able to be implanted in the uterus, like just like the pill and
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.560]   IUDs.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:28.480]   So it makes that a contraception itself besides condoms could also become illegal.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:34.520]   And so your own right to being able to have any type of contraception besides using a
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.200]   condom also can become an issue.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.320]   I just wanted to jump in and say that a consumer report's not me.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.000]   I was not involved in this story.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.600]   But we published a story a few days ago about period tracking apps, privacy, the whole nine
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:51.920]   yards and their privacy concerns and what's good, what's bad, and what these apps are
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:55.520]   actually looking at, what data they're collecting, the whole nine yards.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:00.240]   So if you just Google Consumer Reports, period tracking apps, again, I had nothing to do with
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.240]   the story.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:05.680]   It was written by a colleague called Catherine Roberts, published May 25th.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.560]   Oh, this is an old one.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.560]   So Donna Rosado published a piece two years ago.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.760]   So good on you, Consumer Reports, raising this issue two years ago.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.520]   And now there's a more recent update.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.080]   Much more in depth one about a week ago.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.160]   Again, I was involved.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.120]   I was writing about office chairs last week.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.840]   Well, all right.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.080]   That's okay.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.560]   That's important too.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.600]   I mean, it is kind of funny in the context of what we look at.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.820]   But for sure, you know, this is an important issue.
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:40.400]   And we had some folks smarter than me on this issue.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.920]   Take a look at these apps.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:53.280]   So they Catherine, let's say Catherine, looked at four different period tracker apps whose
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.000]   names include drip.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.280]   I'm not sure I'd want to use that one.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.920]   I'm just saying Yuki.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.320]   I don't know.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.080]   Lady cycle and periodical.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.560]   I'm thinking men are naming these.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560]   I don't know.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.560]   I don't know.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   I could be wrong.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.560]   Wow.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.880]   The child one makes me laugh.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.880]   I don't know.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.880]   I don't know.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   That's just kind of funny.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.880]   I don't know.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.880]   Don't know.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.880]   Anyway, I don't know.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.880]   No one's going to touch your app.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.880]   You know, you don't have to worry about someone's.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   It's just yours.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.880]   It's just yours.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.960]   No one's going to use it by mistake.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:36.400]   The article says we chose these apps because they were recommended by the privacy community.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.720]   And so they compared them with four other apps that are much more popular like flow,
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.880]   which I think we all are familiar with.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.360]   Flow got in trouble as I remember, right, for selling information on period calendar,
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   period tracker, and fertility friend.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.040]   Ah, yes.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040]   Sure.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.600]   Anyway, they do recommend drip, Yuki, and periodical, which all store local data and
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.640]   don't allow third party tracking.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640]   Although these days...
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.240]   What happens if a government official, if it becomes law and then they ask for it,
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.400]   there's still...
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.920]   It still becomes a problem if it becomes a law.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920]   So...
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:18.680]   I think the ones that your data stays on your phone that don't go to the company, those
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.080]   are the ones to look at.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.680]   And this, I'm glad to say this article is not just subscribers only, anybody can read
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.680]   this article.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.680]   So that's nice.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.600]   Thank you, consumer union for doing that.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.080]   We're going to take a little break and we will be back with more in just a bit, our great
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.080]   panel.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.400]   Georgia Dow, Nicholas de Leon, and Andy Ennaco, dear friend.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.040]   Actually, Andy, I want to talk a little bit about Apple.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.360]   There's some good and there's some bad in the Apple world.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:51.120]   I went into Lisa's office a couple of days ago and she's listening to Didro Brian, HR
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.520]   person for Apple.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:56.320]   Give a speech to Apple employees about why the union...
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.960]   They just won't care about you as much as we do.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.120]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.120]   Lisa...
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.240]   Lisa, the chorus mother, the chorus father.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.800]   I want to give credit to Lisa, who's the CEO and of course runs the company and probably
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.240]   would be, if anybody were going to be giving that speech a tweet, it would be her.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.240]   She was incensed.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.720]   She was like, "That's ridiculous."
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.680]   So go ahead and unionize, John.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.680]   How many...
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.640]   If there's only one employee, do half of you have to vote yes and the other half...
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.640]   It's okay.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.040]   I don't know how that works.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.880]   Our show today brought to you by Userway.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.360]   I am a big fan of Userway.org.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.040]   It's the world's number one accessibility solution.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040]   We use it on our website.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.200]   If you go to twit.tv and you go down to the bottom, you will see the Userway icon, the
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.040]   Vitruvian man with his arms, or her arms straight out.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   You click that and you'll see all sorts of things you can do to make our website more
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.560]   accessible.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.680]   Userway is incredible AI powered solution.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.240]   Priorlessly enforces the hundreds of WCAG guidelines.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.480]   That's the web content accessibility guidelines.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:10.120]   In a matter of seconds, Userway's AI can achieve more than an entire team of developers
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.120]   could do in months.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:17.080]   In fact, once you've learned that you have a requirement because all websites are public
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.800]   entities, so you have a requirement under the ADA in the United States and in other
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.640]   countries, they have laws, similar laws, to make your site accessible, then you may,
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.560]   as I did, go, "Oh, no.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.560]   What does this mean?
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.960]   Is this going to be expensive?
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.440]   It's overwhelming.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.200]   Once you find Userway, you can breathe a sigh of relief.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.280]   Userway solutions make it simple, easy, cost effective.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.880]   In fact, you can go right now to Userway.org/twit and use their free scanning tool, see if your
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.840]   website is already ADA compliant.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.880]   Even if it is, I really love this, because ours was, ours was pretty good.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.760]   I'm proud of our engineers.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.640]   But adding this little button at the bottom makes such a difference.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.440]   You can change the font to a dyslexic friendly font, and you can change the colors and the
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.040]   contrast to make it easier for people with vision issues or colorblindness to see what
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.040]   you're doing.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.040]   It's just fantastic.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.240]   If you have an enterprise level website, huge website, thousands of pages, Userway
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.120]   even has a managed solution.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.680]   Their team can handle everything for you.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.160]   That's what the big boys do.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.840]   Userway's AI and machine learning solutions power accessibility for more than a million
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:31.400]   websites, including Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, many leading brands.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:37.280]   These usability tools, these accessibility tools, are now available to small and medium
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.080]   businesses too.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.000]   But of course, they can scale with you as you grow.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.440]   In fact, Userway is the leading accessibility solution in the market today.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.840]   61% market share.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   It's the biggest in the world.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.040]   Motley Fool, good example.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.400]   Big site.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.640]   They had 1911 pages on their website, 20 million page use a month.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.800]   They had done the right thing, as many of us do.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.200]   You structured it for accessibility, but they spent a lot of time keeping the site updated
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.720]   because you've got new pages all the time.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.960]   The standards are changing all the time.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.240]   Motley Fool went to Userway.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.760]   They added an extra layer of accessibility to make sure their browsing experience was
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.240]   accessible to everybody.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.880]   That's the right thing to do.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.000]   Userway automatically fixes violations at the code level.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.720]   They auto-generate image alt tags.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.320]   Write in the descriptions for you using their image recognition.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320]   You can add to them.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.480]   You can modify it, but you've got a great start right out of the box.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:37.560]   They can fix those complex nav menus that stymie all users.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.840]   Everybody has trouble with them.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:43.800]   They ensure all pop-ups are accessible, fix vague link violations, fix broken links, make
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.760]   sure your site uses accessible colors, but staying true to your brand.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.120]   You'll get a detailed report of all the violations fixed on your website.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.240]   It works anywhere.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.600]   It's a single line of JavaScript.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.760]   That's all we had to add to our website.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:01.880]   Their plugins for WordPress, Shopify, Wix, Site Core, SharePoint.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.800]   Let Userway help your business meet its compliance goals, improve the experience for your users.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.640]   Just listen to what Susan Bennett, the voice of Siri, has to say about Userway.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.920]   Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original voice of Siri.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.760]   You won't hear me say something like this too often.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:22.000]   I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're looking for.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.080]   But every day, that's what the Internet is like for millions of people with disabilities.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.640]   Userway fixes all of that with just one line of code.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.320]   Userway, one line of code can make any website fully accessible and ADA compliant.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.880]   With Userway, everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly and customize it to
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.200]   fit their needs.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.440]   This is the right thing to do.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:49.160]   It's also a great way to showcase your commitment to millions of people with disabilities.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.840]   60 million people who otherwise might not use your business or service.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.000]   Go to userway.org/twit.

[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.640]   Really great guys doing a good job here.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   Userway.org/twit.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:16.240]   Thank you, Userway, for your support.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:21.840]   Deidra O'Brien has the, you know, I wonder as she might be thinking, I wish I didn't
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.200]   have to do this.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.400]   Or maybe she's digging it.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:36.480]   Getting companies like Starbucks, Amazon, fight unions, and still get unionized, it's sending
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.280]   a shiver down the spine of Apple I'm thinking.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.760]   They don't want to be unionized.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:49.880]   They've actually hired a well-known anti-union law firm to come in to support them, to help
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.840]   them in preventing this.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:57.840]   There are already dates and union drives at three of Apple's retail stores, New York,
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.440]   Maryland, and Georgia.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.280]   Maryland and Georgia have set dates to hold elections.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.200]   June 2nd, workers in the Cumberland Mall Apple Store will vote.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.000]   Apple's Towson Center store in Maryland do that on June 15th.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.760]   So a video has been sent, and this is what companies do.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.400]   They have mandatory meetings, not illegal.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.760]   All the employees come in kind of like an all hands in the store, and they play this
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.080]   video from Deidra O'Brien, in which she says, "Apple moves incredibly fast.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.120]   It's one thing I love about our work in retail.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.960]   It means we need to be able to move fast, too."
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:37.800]   And I worry, I worry, because the union will bring its own legally mandated rules that
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.600]   will determine how we work through issues that could make it harder for us to act swiftly
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.200]   to address the things you raise.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.480]   I'm committed to am proud of our ability to act fast and support our teams to support
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:55.320]   you, but I don't know if we could have moved as quickly under a collective bargaining agreement.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:59.680]   We could limit our ability to make widespread changes to improve your experience.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.400]   And I think that's what's at stake here.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:07.280]   Apple also put their money where their mouth is raising the minimum wage from $20 to $22
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.440]   an hour.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.680]   So it's pretty good pay.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.880]   Gosh, I guess they're a claim to do that all the...
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.560]   Yeah, but this is why it's important that employees at least try to unionize, because
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:28.280]   guess what? Turns out that Apple could afford to give everybody a minimum $2 raise all along.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:36.000]   But I guess they were planning to do that anyway, and just serendipitously, since I've
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.560]   got your ear anyway, and told me not to join all the union, this is...
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:44.160]   No, exactly. It was the pressure that this came that they was put upon them.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:50.160]   And oddly enough, it's this kind of response that represents why unions are very, very
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:59.000]   important, because otherwise, a corporation can basically take a paternal attitude towards
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.400]   their workers and only give such children.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   We know what's best.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.400]   Exactly.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.360]   We don't want you to do something foolish that'll just ruin your life.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.800]   We're looking out for you.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.200]   We like the system where you ask us for things, and based on our own whims, we either say
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.960]   no, or we say we think about it.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.960]   And this is... I don't blame Apple for doing this.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.480]   They are, again, a $2 trillion company.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.560]   That's whenever I say that a lot, but only because a lot of people have this idea of
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.480]   two hippies in a garage who just want to change the world.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.480]   And that was actually...
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.360]   It was just one of those people who were actually hippies, as we find out.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:41.880]   But a $2 trillion company is probably always going to react to unionization of their hourly
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   wage employees with trying to slap that down as hard as they can without actually
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.120]   hiring Pinkerton men to store each store.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:58.360]   But as you say, this week, I think on the second, the Maryland store is voting, and
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:04.560]   then on the middle of June is when the Georgia store is voting.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.600]   They have to file with the NLRB, so you can actually track that sort of stuff and see
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600]   what's going on.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.800]   I mean, but remember that this was the same company that basically was telling all their
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.840]   employees, by the way, after you clock out, you're going to have to see what's going on.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.880]   Just hang around for a half hour while our store security examines your backpack and
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.480]   examines your bag to make sure you're not shoplifting for us.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.920]   And by the way, you're not being paid for the time you're waiting for that security
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.320]   sweep to come over.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.240]   Again, you need to be able to return the fire against your employers or else you have
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.760]   absolutely no ability to resist when they do stupid things.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.800]   Georgia, you wanted to say something?
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.760]   Yeah, it's one of these things where these are huge companies that you really can't go
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.760]   against.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.720]   And people unionize, you become this huge company that's able to deal with it.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.280]   And let's just say it, like $22 an hour doesn't even hit inflation.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.760]   That would be $25 an hour plus.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:03.600]   And so Apple knows that if there's, like, unfortunately, the US is so far behind with
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:11.520]   leave, sick days, maternity, paternity sets, like being able to take days off, being able
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.120]   to have your own legal representative to be able to deal with these companies.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.600]   HR works for the company.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.800]   They don't work for you.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.760]   So you have no recourse.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.920]   And they, you know, especially huge companies that make all of these profits and want to
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.800]   keep their shareholders happy, they don't want people to be able to have the power to
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.160]   unionize.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.000]   And it seems ridiculous that anyone would not say yes to this.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.280]   And companies try to say, "Oh, they're going to take your money."
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.080]   And you can even hear by Apple's approach is that we'll be faster.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.520]   They don't say that this will be better for you, but they really say that, "Oh, we'll
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.520]   be faster."
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.800]   Yeah, it'll be definitely quicker for them to be able to say no to everything that you
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.640]   ask and to not have to raise things.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.520]   But it's not going to be better for you.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.920]   And yeah, it takes more time.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.960]   If you get a legal representative every time you get to go see management, they're going
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.040]   to be much more careful because HR works for the company to make sure that the company
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.120]   is protected.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.840]   Their legal team is making sure that the company is protected.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.520]   You don't have any protections at all.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.120]   And the laws and regulations that are in state are just so very archaic.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:19.600]   It's really sad to see out of all developed nations to see where the US right now is and
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.680]   being able to protect just the regular middle class worker.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:31.960]   And the protections are just so very sad that people can't even spend time with their
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.040]   newborn baby or premature.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.600]   It's ridiculous, whereas most parts of the world that are developed countries have a
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.560]   year plus six months to most places have a year to two years plus that you can stay
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.560]   home with your baby, which companies are able to swallow and governments are being able
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560]   to protect.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.160]   So I really hope that they end up unionizing.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.640]   And I hope that most people that are working there are going to be able to fight for their
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.800]   own rights so that people can eat and stay home and be able to take care of yourself.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.080]   Because let's just say it, the companies are not going to be there to be able to take care
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.080]   of you if you're sick.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.560]   They really, they don't care.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.800]   They're not any company that says that you are family that just says that we are going
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.800]   to be abused.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.280]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.320]   And a very quick statement.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.080]   This isn't a vague sort of notion being a member of the union.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.600]   In the United States, if you're a member of the union, you have real and authoritative
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.560]   protections if you decide to take action against your employer.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.080]   If they have a store decided to, if they're unionized and they went by the numbers and
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.120]   staged a walkout, Apple cannot just simply say, great, you're all fired.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.800]   We're going to be moving new people in there.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   Have fun.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   Wherever you're going to go.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.320]   No, there's procedures that have to be formed there.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.440]   Now work this dispute now forums under the under of the oversight of the National Labor
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.600]   Relations Board that actually has a lot of authority and a lot of power to inflict a
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.680]   lot of pain.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.800]   So maybe Apple will not will want to make people happy and address their concerns in
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.240]   a very meaningful way before everybody walks out on the day after Thanksgiving.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:04.880]   We should also point out that Apple has moved every job they possibly could move to low
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.320]   paying countries like China.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.760]   But they can't do that with retail.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.320]   You have to be in the US to work in a retail store.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.880]   So it's just like Amazon Starbucks.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.520]   These are people who have to work in the US.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.080]   And so Apple's trying to be as cheap as they can with these people and any job that they
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.160]   could move overseas, they did.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.480]   And they didn't move it to high paying Canada.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.400]   They moved it to China and Vietnam and other places where they pay a lot less.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.280]   So yeah, I think I'm a little disappointed.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:54.160]   I mean, Apple kind of plays very much on this notion that they are altruistic and I don't
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.400]   know if hippies is the right word, but people focused, but they went out and hired anti-union
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:03.600]   lawyers from Littler Mendelssohn who are currently working at Starbucks and have worked in the
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.080]   past for McDonald's to prevent uni-ization.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.440]   They're a company.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.160]   And it's okay to unionize.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160]   It's okay.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.840]   Didn't they also, Leo, try to make sure that all of the different companies like VEM and
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.480]   Google and Microsoft that they all kind of had this insider thought of how they were
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.520]   going to pay different employers.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.480]   So that they couldn't end up going to other companies to be able to get more.
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:33.440]   So they're not, they didn't reach becoming a trillion dollar company by being altruistic
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.040]   and kind to their workers and wanting to pay people the most.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.360]   Steve Jobs had an agreement with Google and others to not poach employees, which is a
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.800]   violation of any trust law.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.800]   And to salary cap.
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.800]   Yeah, they got caught.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.200]   And I don't know what happened, but they got caught.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.200]   Did they get fined?
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.200]   Probably not.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.120]   They got slapped on the wrist probably.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:59.760]   I just wanted to jump in and say I was at advice media from 2015 to 2017 when we unionized.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:00.760]   That's right.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.280]   You're one of the early ones to do that.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.280]   Yes, yes.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.360]   I remember my first day at work was August 2015.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:10.720]   I was day one, day two, my managing editor asked if I was interested in joining a union.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.800]   I was like, I've literally never thought about that, but sure, why not?
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.120]   You know, it was kind of interesting.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.400]   And I don't know how folks, how many folks know how this process works, but we had to
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.040]   meet after work offsite in the back of a pizzeria in Brooklyn somewhere.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.560]   We all sat in a circle.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.400]   We all kind of like, so do we want to join a union?
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.400]   Do we want to do this?
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.920]   I had a serious discussion about it.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:34.040]   And it was 99% of people said, yeah, let's do it.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.120]   And so that was just kind of scary.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.480]   Like, oh, we're signing union cards.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.520]   This is such a weird-- and this country just telegraphs, like, oh, a union.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.520]   What is scary?
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.960]   What a hostile thing to do to your employer?
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.920]   And it's like, whatever.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.640]   When we signed the cards and about negotiations of the first country to take about a year,
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.840]   as I recall, but after the contract was ratified, like, we immediately all got raises.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.840]   We all got back pay.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.600]   We all got better leave.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.800]   Like, there was no negative outcome for any of the people who unionized.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.840]   I don't recall vice giving us those scary videos of the go, this will slow down the company.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.520]   I don't recall them doing that.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.880]   To be fair, I wasn't part of the negotiating committee, so I wasn't necessarily privy to
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:21.200]   all the management stuff, but just as a rank and file employee, there was literally zero
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.120]   downside to unionizing.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.120]   So yeah, it's funny.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.040]   I see those comments on Reddit.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.200]   People took, oh, unions, they're this, they're that.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.360]   There's weird opinions in the US about what unions do.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.360]   They're good for workers.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.600]   I don't know why that is much worse than sick.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.600]   Do you think that it's like the company that sends out those messages?
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.600]   No, no, it's political.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:43.600]   No, no, no.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600]   In the US, it's totally political.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.360]   It's totally, it's communism.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.360]   It's political.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:55.040]   And I still wonder if the lobbyists for these large companies are just sending out from the
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.440]   troll farms to like, cause who, like all of the workers benefit, I don't see how this
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:04.080]   will even be like Republican or Democrat, because you don't understand Georgia.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.080]   You don't understand the Americans.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.080]   I'm Canadian, I'm sorry.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   You're Canadian.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.960]   One of the keys to the, you got to understand it if you want to understand America.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.240]   One of the keys to the American psyche is the Horatio Alger story.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:23.200]   You could pull yourself up by your bootstraps with enough hard work and gumption.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.880]   You could be the boss.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.960]   And so there's that same feeling that I could be that billionaire.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.000]   I could be that CEO.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.600]   So I'm not going to make any waves for them because what I'm going to do is pull myself
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.240]   up and become that person.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.320]   And so it's part of the mythology.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:45.600]   And so we actually revere these companies, these bosses, these billionaires, like they're
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.760]   somehow special gods that we could someday aspire to be.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.080]   And we don't want to do anything.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.360]   We don't want to tax them.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.960]   We don't want to get many trouble.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.000]   It's okay.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.760]   And I think that's starting to crack, but it's for a long time.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.920]   It's part of our mythology.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:06.760]   And I think it's unique to America, that idea that anybody can make it here.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:12.280]   And as a result, I don't want to pay taxes when I do, so I better make sure it's okay
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.240]   right now for the billionaires.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.240]   It's so much easier to make it there and pull it yourself up by your bootstraps when
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.640]   you can afford bootstraps.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   First you need bootstraps.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.680]   I'm a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.080]   I have been most of my life.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:35.080]   I remember doing back in the '80s voting in a radio station to bring in the union.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.240]   I've been a member ever since.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.600]   And yeah, it costs you money.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.760]   You pay union dues, but you also get health benefits.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.760]   You also get collect.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.800]   The most important thing is collective bargaining.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.360]   Just as you said, Georgia, your bargaining is a unit as a group of people instead of
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.280]   an individual against a big company.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.880]   They got lawyers.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.000]   They got all sorts of people.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.080]   And it's just you saying, "Can I have a raise, please?"
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.680]   It's much better to bargain collectively.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:07.200]   I think 13% more pay for union represented workers in the US than nonunion right there.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.760]   I got a site studs-tirkel here who had some studs-tirkel.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.800]   He wrote this wonderful book on working.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:19.840]   And he has this, a company, a group put together a video compilation of this story that used
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:27.320]   to tell a lot during his speaking appearances about waiting for the bus in Chicago and
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.160]   the same people, like every single day, some of their Brooks Brothers suit.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:35.320]   And he finally likes-and he finally said, "Oh, my birthday is coming up."
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.920]   And he starts talking about unions and the guy in the Brooks Brothers suit is like, "Oh,
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.920]   I hate unions."
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.600]   And he said, "Okay.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.600]   Did you work 18 hours today or did you work eight hours?
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.600]   Work eight hours.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.600]   Right.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:47.600]   Did you work on Saturday and Sunday?
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.000]   Or did you have the weekend off?
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.280]   Well, I had the weekend off.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.280]   Okay.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.920]   Did you start working at eight or 18?
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.920]   Like, at 18?
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.920]   He's like, "Okay.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:55.920]   Guess what?
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:01.100]   Let me tell you about the Haymarket affair in Chicago 100 years ago where four labor organizers
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:06.300]   were hanged for trying to form a union because they and your other people who were with
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:09.460]   your great-great grandparents fought for your rights.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.360]   That's why you're going home at five o'clock.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.920]   That's why you've got the weekend off.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.840]   That's why you got to go to school.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.600]   So don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't do
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.600]   it.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.280]   Labor unions, because they are we forget all the all the victories that they won through.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.920]   Again, I was not I'm not joking about Pinkerton men.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.360]   Companies would just simply hire people with with guns to simply go in and shoot at people
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.400]   who are protesting people who are blocking the gates and with the with the perfect permission
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.440]   and cadence of a law enforcement in the community.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.800]   So this is this is why I'm very very much pro union and although I'm sure that there
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.760]   are going to be there are stories about how a union was interfering with progress in some
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.760]   way, shape or form.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.360]   Nothing is ever perfect.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:59.400]   If without unions of worker stands alone and has no power against against a huge force
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:04.320]   that is absolutely no interest in giving them anything other than the bare minimum that
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.560]   they're legally required to give them.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:12.680]   Ask your grandpa about the battle of the river Rouge where the Pinkerton's through Walter
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:19.160]   roster, the founder of the AFL CIO off the bridge.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:29.040]   It was a it was quite literally a battle in 1937 because Ford workers wanted a unionize
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.360]   and the United Auto workers were in there to do it and the Ford brought in the Pinkerton's
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.360]   to fight them literally fight them off.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.360]   All right.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.520]   Boy, we sound like a bunch of commies here.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.400]   Let me let me move on.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.400]   There was one of those.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.600]   There was made a recently.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.480]   So we just socialism.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.840]   It's not like those developed countries or social democracies.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.040]   Socialism in the United States.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.040]   You're going to get.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:03.720]   But you have social but you have social socialism for the rich here.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.720]   Get it straight.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.760]   But you have mail and you have a fire department.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.160]   You have the police department and you have like schools that that's all these are all
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.000]   social cons and social security.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.320]   It's even in the name like which I think that most people like.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.680]   Oh, no, I might say.
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:22.680]   The Canadian.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.680]   I can.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680]   No.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.720]   It's a lot harder.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:30.160]   It's a lot harder to fight against people who are saying we believe fundamentally that
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:33.480]   human beings should be treated like human beings no matter how much money that they're
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.600]   much money or power they have.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.760]   And so oh, well, could we call you socialist instead?
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   Like we'd rather be.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.760]   Well, sorry.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   We are pretty much the bumper stickers.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:48.800]   They've managed to demonize any idea like that.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:54.520]   So I am also going to question Apple's commitment to their self repair program.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.520]   And this comes from personal experience.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.720]   We thought it'd be fun for Micah Sergeant.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.680]   He has an iPhone 12 to fix his own battery.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:11.400]   So Micah went to the Apple site, ordered 79 pounds of repair equipment in these two
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.880]   pelican cases.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.520]   Apple shipped them out promptly.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.920]   They're not going to they're going to charge us a small amount to rent them.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.000]   But what they neglected to ship was the battery.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:29.280]   Apparently this 1.1 ounce battery was shipped under by separate cover from different places
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.720]   right right didn't arrive at first.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.720]   We called Apple.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.320]   They said, well, no, there's nothing we can do.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.320]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:41.320]   You only have seven days to return these cases.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:44.440]   Seven days have come and we don't have the battery.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:52.520]   Sorry, you still have to return the 76 pounds worth of gear and you'll get your money back
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.360]   in your credit card.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:59.800]   I think fortunately the battery did arrive at the last minute and Micah was able to get
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.800]   it.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.280]   But I really question Apple's commitment.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:06.920]   I think some of this is really about making you nuts.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.480]   This is the big battery press you have to get.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:15.960]   And there's a heating thing that you put the phone in to loosen the clip.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.280]   Look at the size of this.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:25.880]   They probably they really should have figured out that they can't ship lithium batteries
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880]   by air.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.880]   It has to go by ground.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.680]   So it's not going to arrive at the same time as the case.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.680]   That's right.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:31.680]   I guess that's what I listened.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:37.040]   When you compare to what Samsung and Google do with their phones with I fix it with I fix
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.800]   it, it's like no, yes, it would be great if you had this really impressive like heating
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.240]   element pad device device.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.280]   But we actually think if you just chuck this thing in the microwave and let's warm it up
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:52.520]   and put it on top, it'll actually get the job done and you can actually own it.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:57.240]   I will say though that it's it's I'm not being I'm not joking when I say it's better
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.320]   than nothing because for a lot of people they just don't have access to an Apple store.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.800]   It's like a three or four or five hour drive away.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.800]   So it's it's a benefit.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.920]   It's definitely a benefit for those people.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:13.640]   I wonder if if the momentum or the requirement to answer this question caught them flat footed
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.080]   and this was the best they could put together is just simply say, okay, we can rent out
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.240]   our actual repair tools to make sure this is done carefully and correctly.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:25.520]   And maybe next year they will find they will they will they'll take them a year to put
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:29.880]   together a program so that you can actually get stuff through I fix it that are just cheap
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:33.200]   like eight dollar tools that could be mailed in a simple box.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.800]   But yeah, this does again, this doesn't make Apple look.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:41.760]   I did replace my own battery with I fix it tools on the four XL a pixel Google pixel
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.760]   phone.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.720]   But yeah, Apple really wants you to use this stuff.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.240]   This is like paying a bill in pennies.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.560]   It's like, okay, you gave us what we asked for, but we think you're being kind of a snip
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.560]   about it.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.160]   It costs roughly the same.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.160]   That's the other thing.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.280]   If you add it all up as going to an Apple store and getting them to do it.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.320]   So with all this trouble, you're not saving any money, but you're right.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.720]   If you didn't have access to an Apple store, you didn't want to send it into Apple.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.920]   I guess you could do this.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.560]   I think probably should have been wearing a hazmat.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560]   I know.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560]   That would have been the perfect.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:19.280]   Michael's conclusion was, yeah, you can do it, but you probably shouldn't.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:23.160]   It's probably something here comes here comes the battery the next day.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.320]   It finally, it finally came.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.200]   Burke, run it down the hall.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.960]   And I think you're right, Andy, I didn't even think of this.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.800]   It's because it's lithium ion.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:38.080]   And so it has to be, oh, but meanwhile, Mike is bringing the, he has to shift those back
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.440]   because the deadline lapsed.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.440]   So I don't know.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440]   Did he get to do it or not, John?
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.440]   I don't know.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.440]   I never did get to do it.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.440]   I've seen that car.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:48.240]   Maybe he like, you get a friend like fix it while he's on his way back to FedEx.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.840]   Oh, Lordy, Lordy.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.480]   Anyway, it's a good video.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.480]   It's a good video.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.240]   The airbag suspension in this new Honda Accord is so smooth.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.920]   I can replace this cracked phone screen while I go over this unpaved road.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:06.840]   It's the videos on the YouTube, a Twitch channel, youtube.com/twit.
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:09.200]   iPhone self repair.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.200]   We tried it.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.200]   You shouldn't.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.480]   Look what I got.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.480]   I'm so excited.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.600]   This did come on time.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.840]   This is my new coffee from trade.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:20.840]   Do you love coffee?
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.460]   Who doesn't love coffee?
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:29.800]   Would you love to try coffee from some of the best craft roasters in the country?
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.520]   There's a coffee renaissance going on in the United States.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:38.360]   And there are small roasters all over the country doing amazing stuff.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:43.160]   Trade brings you coffee from these craft roasters.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.560]   It's completely fresh.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.340]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:49.560]   They're independent businesses from all over big cities and small towns.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.600]   Let's see what I got.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.780]   This is from tips up tall French roast.
[01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:57.380]   Yeah, we love we love our dark our dark stuff.
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:03.420]   This is a French roast from a little Tahoe roaster roasting at 6,000 feet in the Sierra
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:08.900]   Nevada allows us unique environmental advantages to maximize sweetness.
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.940]   Oh, I can't wait to try it.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:15.820]   Trade coffee is connecting you with small craft roasters to bring you absolutely fresh
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:17.380]   coffee.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:19.380]   It's really cool.
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.200]   These are really great coffees.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:31.000]   Now it starts with the quiz and I highly recommend you do this at drinktrade.com/twit.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.720]   They'll ask you a couple of questions about what you like, not just about what you like
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.440]   in coffee, but what you like in general.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:44.060]   And then they'll make some recommendations a personalized list of varieties delivered
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.840]   fresh to you as often as you want.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:52.960]   No more than you need, although it's always nice to have a freshly roasted pound of coffee
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.420]   just waiting for you.
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:58.760]   We get it as beans because we like to grind it, but you can also get it if you want ground
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:04.200]   ahead of time freshly roasted 60 of the country's best craft roasters.
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.160]   And these are by the way, all small businesses who sustainably source their coffee.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.840]   They pay farmers fair prices.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:15.500]   The best beans, they're absolutely fresh.
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:20.720]   And it's going to be beans that match your particular tastes.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:26.520]   Trade is delivered over 5 million bags of fresh coffee, 750,000 positive reviews, new

[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:50.780]   interesting.

[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.460]   Don't forget Father's Day is coming up.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:59.340]   This would be a great gift for the dad in your life who loves coffee, a subscription to
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.340]   trade.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.180]   I want to open this and drink it.
[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:05.140]   Drinktrade.com/twit.
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:09.540]   This smells really good.
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.340]   Drink coffee do stuff.
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:15.340]   This especially coffee company built with the belief that extraordinary coffee leads to
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:17.340]   extraordinary life.
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:21.380]   That's cool.
[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:28.860]   So all of the coffees are sourced from mountains and roasted at high altitude.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:30.720]   Tips up Tahoe French Roast.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:34.620]   Tastes like bittersweet chocolate, allspice, bored, bold and strong.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:38.780]   So the company is Drink Coffee Do Stuff.
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:42.860]   That's a really good name for a coffee place.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:43.860]   It's fun.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:47.420]   Every one I get of these is somewhere different, somewhere fun all over the world.
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:49.580]   I'll save this for tonight.
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:50.420]   Thank you, Trade.
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:51.420]   Drinktrade.com/twit.
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:58.700]   I thank you so much for their support of this weekend tech.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.540]   Now some good stuff about Apple because we've been mean.
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:06.220]   I've been mean to Apple.
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:09.220]   I think you're going to be pretty excited.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.980]   Georgia Dow about Apple's VR headset.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:14.100]   Are you looking forward to that?
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:16.460]   I'm looking forward to it except for the price.
[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:17.460]   Holy Jesus.
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:19.420]   I'll buy four wheels instead of this.
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:21.180]   Yeah, you practically could get a car.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.180]   What are they saying?
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:23.180]   This is all rumor.
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.940]   But it's from Mark Gurman who's pretty reliable.
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:26.940]   $3,000?
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.940]   Is that what they said?
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:31.180]   Yeah, it's around $3,000.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.180]   Which I'll still get it.
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.060]   It's really pricey.
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:38.660]   And it's going to be, I think this is the developer edition.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:39.980]   Again, we won't know.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:44.460]   There's even some debate about whether we're going to hear about it a week from tomorrow
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:48.580]   because that's Apple's WWDC keynote is June 6th.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:55.140]   And I just saw, I think it was Gurman saying probably MacBook Airs in color based on the
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:34:00.740]   M2 chip, but maybe not anything about VR AR.
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:04.460]   But I think they have to at their developers conference, right?
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:06.540]   I would hope that they will show something.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.060]   Just give me a little taste.
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.060]   I don't care if it's AR.
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:14.860]   It doesn't have to be VR because they'll probably roll out AR beforehand.
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:19.140]   But I'd like to see what they feel like they can come up with.
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:20.940]   It's still probably a little while away.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:23.260]   But I think that would be really neat.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:30.500]   But you need to get developers to line up and start thinking about it, right?
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:31.660]   I would love that.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.740]   Again, I'm not so sure.
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:34.900]   I don't know, Andy, if you're so sure.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.300]   I'm not so sure that we're going to see it.
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:41.340]   I really hope so, but I'm not holding out my hope for it.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:42.340]   Andy?
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.860]   I don't think so.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:48.740]   I think this is going to follow the same path as the Apple Watch, as the iPad, as the
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:53.540]   iPhone, where there's going to be a point at which they have to file a lot of really,
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:58.940]   really explicit paperwork with the FCC and others to explain exactly what it looks like.
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.540]   Here's exactly what hardware is inside here or in terms of the radios.
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:05.940]   And so there's going to be a launch event where they're going to show it, but it's not
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:07.860]   going to be available for months after that.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:11.300]   And that's going to be because this is the...
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:15.380]   It's going to go public in January through government filings anyway, so you may as
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.180]   well give people the full demo.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:21.500]   And then if you announce it in January and launch it in...
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:26.620]   Make it actually available in June, you get to see developers now that this thing is completely
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.620]   public.
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:33.980]   Get to see selective developers with early hardware and early development tools so that
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:39.340]   when you actually do start making pre-orders available, there's actually live demos of
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:43.380]   actual functional practical things that Apple didn't have to do in-house.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:50.100]   So I'd be really, really surprised if Apple showed off anything that was explicitly pointing
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:54.020]   to the AR or VR headset at WWDC.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:59.020]   I would be more inclined to think that there's going to be a lot of beard stroking.
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:04.260]   You think people examine minutely what the invites to Apple events look like to say, "Ooh,
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:06.540]   there's sort of a ripple in that section of the Apple logo.
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:10.900]   I think it's because the new iPhone is actually going to be not just water resistant, but fully
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.900]   waterproof."
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.940]   I think that people are going to look at, "Wait a minute.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:18.940]   There's a new 3D object that they're adding to this established API and there is this new
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:28.980]   course track about how to gain telemetry from live cameras that they're using existing iPhones
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:36.180]   and iPads as examples for capturing this data and creating AR objects out of it.
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:42.220]   This could be very, very well applied to an upcoming AR headset so that they will be
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:45.580]   laying the groundwork without actually saying that they're laying the groundwork for this."
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:51.260]   Again, I really do feel as though I don't see a reason why they would even announce anything
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:54.420]   this year if they're not going to launch anything this year and I don't think they're
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:55.620]   going to launch anything this year.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:37:02.300]   I do think it's going to be like, again, January-ish announcement, like mid to late winter announcement,
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:07.780]   late spring, early summer pre-orders and actual full bells and whistles demo.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:13.100]   It makes sense because there's also this big issue of China shutting down to the COVID
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:15.300]   restrictions.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.180]   I wonder if they'll even be able to get laptops.
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:22.980]   The laptops they have now are already pushed out two, three, four months.
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:25.220]   It's getting harder and harder to get stuff.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:32.940]   It's really good at basically bulldogging any other competitor saying, "You wanted to
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:33.940]   buy it?
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:37.500]   You'd be able to buy 8K internal displays."
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:41.940]   We bought all of the manufacturing capability for 8K goggle mounted displays for the next
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:42.940]   five years.
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.940]   We're locked with that.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:45.940]   No, it's interesting.
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:46.940]   But you're right.
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.940]   It's going to affect the economy.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.740]   Definitely add this to your bingo card if you're keeping track of all this and we will
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:53.380]   do our live coverage.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:58.940]   As usual, it's on Monday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, a week from tomorrow, June
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.100]   6th for Apple's WWDC.
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:03.860]   We all want big announcements.
[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:05.300]   What are you giggling at?
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:10.620]   No, no, I'm just very, very glad that I don't live in the San Francisco area because
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:17.940]   I would not be able to resist just mocking up a really good looking pair of not-- but
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:21.820]   it looks like a really bad final pair of goggles and then just quietly being out of
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:27.820]   Wendy's and just wearing them and looking around using my hands and then taking them
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:30.220]   off and being shocked that people are looking at me and taking my picture.
[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:32.140]   Oh my God, and stuffing this in a bag.
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:36.140]   Just to see how many people I can catfish with these things.
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.340]   Catfishing with apple goggles.
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:42.860]   The rumor mill's going crazy about it.
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:45.700]   YouTube video after video.
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:50.580]   They look-- everything I've seen looks kind of like a conventional VR headset.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.260]   But we've heard rumors there are 14 cameras.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:58.940]   There may be cameras looking out as well as looking in so that you could see the world
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:04.780]   around you but also people around you might be able to see your face on a screen.
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:08.420]   I mean, it's going to be lots of rumors.
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:12.780]   When you think about it, that's another thing that I think parallels with the iPhone and
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.460]   the iPad and the Apple Watch.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:17.820]   None of these things were like, "Oh my God, we had no idea.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.620]   What a wonderful surprise."
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:24.580]   It's like the year before the iPhone, everybody knew that Apple was close to shipping an iPhone.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:30.740]   The year before the iPad, everybody knew Apple was close to shipping some sort of a tablet
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:35.180]   to the point where the week before or the month before that January event, everybody
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:40.220]   was speculating as to, "Okay, it can't be cheaper than $999.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:44.940]   It will probably run a slim down version of Mac OS or will it run an enhanced version
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:45.940]   of iOS?"
[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:48.660]   So I really think that this is tracking very, very closely.
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:53.180]   We're getting a lot of anxious people who are now basically saying that we're ready for
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:56.260]   you to release the thing, whatever the thing is.
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:00.060]   We've got the $3,000 on an envelope under the mattress.
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:03.380]   Please give it to us before we find something else to spend this $3,000.
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:06.020]   They wanted to give George enough time to save up for this.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:07.020]   Absolutely.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.020]   You need to save up for this.
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:09.020]   You really do.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:10.020]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:15.060]   Nicholas, do you do articles on AR/VR?
[01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.860]   We've done a little bit of VR stuff.
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:18.060]   I personally own a Quest.
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:21.700]   I personally had the Rift back in the day.
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:27.020]   So I'm an enthusiast in this space, but as far as CR goes, that's one of the things we,
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:30.860]   is there a lot of consumer demand for this type of content?
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:34.860]   I've done stories here and there and they haven't done super well, so I don't know
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.300]   if that means anything.
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.300]   I am very curious.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.380]   My personal thing is if anyone can figure this out, I guess it's Apple.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:49.300]   $3,000, I mean, to me, that seems expensive, but what do I know?
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:53.100]   But as far as a mass market consumer device, that feels kind of pricey.
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:58.500]   But again, I'm happy to be convinced, again, if anyone can figure this out, I guess it's
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.500]   Apple.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.540]   But yeah, we do a little bit here and there.
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:06.980]   It's just not quite a huge consumer demand for this type of stuff yet.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:09.220]   And I guess we'll see.
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:15.500]   That's interesting, because the people who use Quest love them.
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:21.340]   But it isn't a large portion of the tech buying audience.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:27.300]   And I wonder, once it gets beyond the enthusiasts, the guys who have the huge gaming PCs that
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:33.140]   they plug in and they're all about it, like, "Well, my adopted mom sit there with a headset
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:35.060]   for any amount of time."
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:37.260]   I kind of doubt it.
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:39.140]   That's the leap I'm really puzzled about.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:40.140]   Yeah, I don't...
[01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:41.140]   I might.
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:46.140]   I'm a nerd, but we'll regulate the man on the street in Times Square, I guess we'll see.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:47.900]   You know what the thing though is?
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:53.460]   I don't think that it's the... because most of the people that I have try out VR, they're
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.900]   like soccer moms and people that are not at all techies love it.
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:02.620]   They absolutely love it, eat it up, want to come over every time they come over, they
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:08.300]   want to try it out, try the new experience, go to this museum, visit this Mayan temple.
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:10.900]   They enjoy all of the different experiences with it.
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:15.340]   It is this arduous amount of setup and computers.
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:16.340]   For sure.
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:17.340]   For the reason.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:18.340]   Putting up the wires.
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:26.020]   That barrier to entry is just so big that I wonder if Apple can do it so that it's more
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:27.020]   quest-like.
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:29.140]   It's really just kind of plug and play.
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:34.100]   You can use it and not have to worry if that would make a difference.
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:36.140]   And a little bit of the vertigo is still happening.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:37.140]   I don't know.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.460]   That's still a big deal.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:42.820]   I still have some people that get quite ill, even though we kind of understand lots of the
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:48.860]   mechanisms that are at play to create that feeling of vertigo and nausea that you can
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.860]   get afterwards.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:55.220]   I'm wondering if Apple could do it in a way that just like the iPhone was so much easier
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:59.940]   to use when it came out versus the desire of people's trios.
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.460]   Let me ask you this.
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:07.380]   Is the quest, which doesn't have all that setup, is it not as good as a result?
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:08.380]   No.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:09.380]   Sorry.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:10.380]   Oh, no, no.
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:13.980]   So you really want a vibe or a rift.
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:15.020]   You really don't want--
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:17.740]   What are you using it for?
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.740]   Right?
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:19.740]   Yeah.
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:20.980]   It depends on what you're using it for.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:26.860]   If you are using this to game and you want to play a very immersive game with a lot of
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:32.060]   frame rate, having the extra cameras, it's a huge-- it's a deal to change.
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:37.060]   You get the two controllers, you get the different cameras, you can play a higher frame rate.
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:38.060]   You need that system.
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:40.740]   It's still a very intensive system.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:47.020]   If you're just going to be using the experience to do a little fishing game or watching movies
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:53.180]   or tend to concert or do an experience where you're going to move and going to a museum
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.900]   or Ikea, then it's not that big of a deal.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:57.980]   So I think that it's also how you use it.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:02.020]   So maybe the trick for Apple and any company that wants to succeed in this is getting the
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:08.860]   quality of a rift or a vibe onto something as easy to set up as a quest.
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:11.940]   If you could do that, then you might really have a product.
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:16.820]   And even better, if you could keep it from making people throw up, even better.
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:18.820]   Right?
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:19.820]   Even better.
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.820]   Yeah.
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:23.540]   I'm convinced, by the way, that it's about-- I think the Air Force said 11% of the population,
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:28.580]   but there's some intractable percentage of the population that will never be able to use
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:30.740]   these without becoming nauseated.
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:36.060]   I will say, when the PlayStation VR came out a few years ago, I tried that at a trade show
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:37.260]   in New York City.
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:38.740]   I could not sleep that night.
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:43.820]   I was so nauseous from-- I was using it at 6 p.m. in the evening, messed around with
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:44.820]   a bunch of games.
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.100]   I did not sleep that evening.
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:48.340]   That's not to pick on Sony or whatever.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:49.660]   But I couldn't.
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:51.780]   I was so affected by that.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.020]   That hasn't happened since.
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:57.460]   I had since played Resident Evil 7 in PlayStation VR, and it was pretty much fine.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:59.300]   I played Half Life in VR.
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.300]   Fine.
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:01.300]   I don't really know, but for sure--
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.300]   Well, there's still some-- I had one very bad experience.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.100]   There's still some games that will make me queasy.
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:09.060]   I was playing No Man's Sky the other day to make me queasy, whereas I played Valheim for
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:12.780]   literally 1,000 hours and never once got queasy.
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:14.020]   And that's not with a headset.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:15.740]   That's just in front of a big screen.
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:18.900]   So there's head bob or something that's causing that.
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:26.940]   But I think that there is a disconnect between the focal length of the object you're looking
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:30.620]   at and the convergence distance of the object.
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:35.860]   Because your eyes are converging on a nearby object, but the object seems to be at a greater
[01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:36.860]   distance.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:39.980]   And I believe that that's your brain saying you ate bad mushrooms.
[01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:41.620]   You better throw those up.
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:43.020]   And I don't know if you can fix that.
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:44.020]   That is true.
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:45.020]   I don't know if you can fix that.
[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:46.020]   No, but you are accurate with that.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:51.020]   But it's often where the horizon is and the feedback in your head versus the feedback
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:54.620]   that's happening on the horizon of what you're looking at.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:46:00.540]   And also for people that often, like I usually do the point and click movement versus the
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:06.180]   a real time movement because that decreases the chance of getting ill.
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:10.100]   So games where you're spinning and you're getting different information like flying
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:16.340]   games or assuming have a much greater chance of thinking about it.
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.540]   But you're absolutely right.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:20.100]   It is us saying that you're not feeling well.
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:21.100]   Maybe you ate something.
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:24.740]   Why would the ground be moving when you're not actually moving?
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:32.740]   Aaron Space Magazine wrote an article 20 years ago called barfology based on research done
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:34.980]   by the, you know, is that a good name?
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:36.700]   Based on research done by the Air Force.
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:38.500]   You're fine over your fear master's program.
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:39.500]   I'm not.
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.300]   I've minored in barfology.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:43.900]   Delta Chi, right?
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:48.820]   But the Air Force after much study of their of simulator sickness and things like that
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:55.500]   is concluded about 10 or 11% of everybody is, you know, to the point where some people
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:47:01.480]   shouldn't drive a car for 24 hours after being in a simulator.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.620]   In one study, standing in Kennedy found that about 10% of simulator users reported vision
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:07.900]   related symptoms like a headache.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:13.620]   And though there's seven and a half percent reported nausea, 5% suffered from disorientation
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.660]   while using a virtual reality helmet.
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:17.820]   Now this is 20 years ago.
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:23.660]   25% experienced nausea, 30% disorientation.
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:25.980]   The industry says, oh, it's frame rate.
[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:26.980]   It's resolution.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:29.660]   We can fix this.
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:31.340]   You know, they're going to have to fit.
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:32.340]   That's another thing.
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:36.300]   They're going to have to figure out before they make this a mass market product.
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:37.300]   Yeah.
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:38.300]   Right.
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:39.300]   Well, that's, well, that's another question.
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:40.940]   Are they going to make it a mass market product?
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:44.060]   There are lots of, there are a few companies that are actually having pretty good success
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:48.540]   with these kinds of wearables, call them augmented reality, call them virtual reality.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.460]   Most of them have to do not either really, these really, really cheap headsets that are
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:58.660]   good for entertainment that are mass market, but most of them are for the military use,
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:04.580]   medical use, industrial use, verticals, basically situations in which the one that makes the
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:08.500]   most sense to me that keeps coming up in these explanations are all of the, when people
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:12.580]   are repairing aircraft, all the checklists that they have to go through, all the paperwork
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:16.580]   that they have to manage to make sure that when they check and fix a brake system on
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:20.180]   an airplane, they can certify that, yes, this was done in the proper order.
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:22.180]   I'm going to photograph what needs to be photographed.
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:24.460]   I'm going to record what readings that were taken.
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:27.860]   I'm going to basically affirm each step of this process.
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:29.700]   And also I'm going to have this checklist in front of me.
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:34.380]   So I remember what has to be done in order to do this job safely and the ability to simply
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:37.580]   take all that, all those binders and all that paperwork and all those, even those slates
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:42.340]   out of the way and basically have a wearable that keeps that documentation in your somewhere
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:46.060]   in your line of sight while you're doing it and being able to actually create these records
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:48.220]   while you go, that saves a hell of a lot of money.
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:52.540]   And there are companies that are happily going to spend $3,000 for people who are going to
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:57.980]   be wearing these for maybe a half hour at a time or 20 minutes at a time.
[01:48:57.980 --> 01:48:59.420]   They're not going to be wearing them full time.
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:01.060]   So that's not really an issue.
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:07.300]   I mean, I keep trying to figure out what Apple could do to make this really palatable to somebody
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:12.340]   who has these Buck Rogers attitudes about what they expect of virtual reality or augmented
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:14.900]   reality goggles system to go.
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:17.380]   And I keep, I don't have that much imagination.
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:23.140]   I keep thinking of it as something like a Mac Pro where we're shocked at that when you
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:26.180]   look at the configurator, oh my God, there are people, it's possible to configure this
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:28.340]   will cost $16,000.
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:31.220]   But then you remember, but that, but then you remember that there are people that will
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:36.140]   say, great, I know what two clients I'm going to build this to and it'll be because I'm
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:39.860]   making so it's so important for this, these jobs that I'm doing.
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.460]   And I know that I will, it will make its money back.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:45.540]   Those are the people I think that'll, that are most eager to be able to create content
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:50.620]   for $3,000 headset that especially if it's something that, hey, yes, we finished the addition
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:56.100]   to this, this park that this museum building put on these goggles and we'll walk you through
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.100]   it.
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:00.660]   Again, I don't know, I don't know how they're going to fix the, the nausea issue.
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:04.020]   If they're going to say that we're going to create a new worktop environment that you're
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:07.460]   going to want to spend three or four hours and that's going to be a hard sell.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:13.860]   Well, I do think augmented reality has somewhat different issues than virtual reality because
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:18.260]   at least you could see, I don't know if you have the same nausea issues.
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:22.660]   No, I mean, I, I used to, I'm one of those idiots who used to wear Google Glass like
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:28.020]   all the time because when I, when I'm a daily walk, I really enjoyed the, because it was
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:30.260]   just this little screen that was on the side.
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:33.100]   I wouldn't be surprised if that's something that Apple has been playing with the idea of
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:36.980]   having something like an Apple Watch, which is not designed to be an immersive environment.
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:42.100]   It's just designed to put the, just the data than just the tools that you need at a place
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:45.540]   where it's more convenient than taking a phone out of your pocket.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:51.900]   And that those are also the only display technologies that I have come across, even
[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:57.220]   experimentally that can convincingly be built inside a pair of glasses, but usually, usually
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:01.780]   a pair of buddy Holly glasses, but at least you won't be like tackled to the ground and
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:05.620]   frisked when you were walking through an area and wearing these damn things.
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.580]   So it all, all things are on the table.
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:11.860]   I, there are times where I have to be understand that there's almost nothing that I know for
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:14.140]   sure about this thing.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:18.940]   And I have to be, have my mind open to almost anything could be released almost at any
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:19.940]   time.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:24.340]   Again, I still don't think it until 2023, but I will not be surprised by anything that
[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:29.820]   Apple comes up with because I think that a lot of things are on the table.
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:31.700]   One thing Apple is doing right.
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:36.260]   And I can tell because Microsoft is responding is it's Apple Silicon.
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:37.820]   It's M one chips.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:41.860]   Microsoft had its developer conference this week build and announced they're going to
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:47.020]   make a developer box project Voltera.
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:51.540]   They're calling it that has, I know, it's a comic book name.
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:52.540]   Okay.
[01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:53.540]   Good, good, good for them.
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:58.860]   It has an ARM based version of visual studio 2022, their programming environment and a
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:03.780]   little ARM based Windows PC running Windows for ARM.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:06.780]   Now the video, this is the video.
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:08.780]   It doesn't have anything to do with any.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:09.780]   It looks like Mordor.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:10.780]   It looks like Mordor.
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:12.540]   It's the strangest video.
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:14.020]   It's ominous.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:15.020]   It's ominous.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.020]   The rocks are breaking.
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.020]   The lava is coming.
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:18.020]   Get out.
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:19.020]   Get out.
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:20.020]   Run while you still can.
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:21.020]   No, no, no.
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:22.980]   This is just a new computer.
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:25.020]   They did not say when it would be available.
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:26.580]   They did not say how much it would be.
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:28.220]   They did not say what chip it would run.
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:31.180]   They did not say anything.
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:34.020]   But I think this is very much, I mean, look at it.
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:39.980]   It's a Mac mini built for Windows developers to use Windows on ARM.
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:47.980]   One of the things they did mention, which is kind of interesting, is it has a three
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:56.260]   kind of unit, oh, by the way, made from beautiful recycled ocean plastic.
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:58.620]   So that's why there's so much plastic in there.
[01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:03.940]   Microsoft is dumping plastic as they're refining techniques and harvesting the cutout.
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:06.540]   One of the things they keep showing is stacked.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:12.300]   So it's stackable, although no developer I know wants two of these things.
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:17.460]   But I do think that they're pushing it as an AI device.
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:23.500]   And they're mentioning the fact that it has its own neural processor unit and that will
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:29.340]   connect with Azure, some sort of Azure support.
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:33.580]   So some sort of kind of offloading to the cloud capability.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:40.500]   Microsoft's Panos Panay said, we want you to build cloud native AI applications with
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:46.420]   native ARM64 Visual Studio.net support.
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:50.820]   Project Voltaire coming later this year, new tools to help you take the first step on
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:51.820]   this journey.
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:56.020]   Obviously, I really think they rushed this announcement because they're so nervous about
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.740]   M1 and now M2.
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:00.140]   And Apple's really getting an awful lot of attention for that.
[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:02.060]   Intel also responding.
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:07.380]   Their 12th generation processors now have efficiency cores kind of like the ARM processors.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:14.260]   I feel like Apple did really kind of surprise the PC world and they're trying to respond
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:15.820]   as quickly as they can.
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:23.060]   Yeah, the same thing about Google and their own AI-based processors.
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:29.300]   They're Google silicon and it might be based largely on Samsung's Exynos processors.
[01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:30.860]   But still it's getting fun.
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:31.860]   It's got to see you in there.
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:39.100]   I mean, after 10 years of the iPhone, manufacturers are getting the idea that you can't just simply
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:43.300]   rely on Intel or Qualcomm to deliver the chip that you absolutely need at the time when you
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:48.300]   actually need it.
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:54.980]   If you want to control your own destiny and make the products that will help you live,
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:57.820]   thrive and survive, you're going to have to basically own the whole widget.
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:00.820]   Just like Mr. Jobs said, do yours and yours and yours.
[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:03.820]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:08.700]   Final thoughts, final stories coming up in just a little bit but our show today brought
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:10.700]   to you by something I want you all to know about.
[01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:15.460]   Let's you create real credit cards that you can use online.
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:16.540]   There are two different kinds.
[01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:19.220]   There's burner cards that can only be used once.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:23.740]   So there's never any risk of being stolen and used anywhere else.
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:25.380]   And there's merchant locked cards.
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:30.620]   The minute you use it with a merchant can only be used by that merchant, all of which
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:36.100]   makes your life much more secure, makes you feel better about using credit cards online.
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:39.260]   They have plug-ins for Firefox and Chrome.
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:43.300]   And when you use this credit card, as I do with every online purchase, you can put any
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:45.620]   address, any name you want.
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:48.420]   Privacy will approve it because they know it's you.
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:50.620]   So it masks your real bank information.
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:55.940]   You never have to worry about giving it out to strangers online.
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:58.100]   It's a great tool for subscriptions.
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:02.340]   If you're about to sign up for something that's going to have a recurring payment, use your
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:05.660]   privacy.com card because you'll never be overcharged.
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:11.660]   You could set a limit per charge per month per week per year, but you can also pause
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:14.740]   a card so that they can't overcharge you.
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:18.340]   I've had this happen before where I signed up for a gym membership.
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:21.940]   I didn't realize that the trainer sessions were separate.
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:25.980]   When I canceled the gym membership, they kept charging me for the trainer for months.
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:29.220]   When I finally figured out the credit card company said, "Well, it's been more than three
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.140]   months and nothing we can do for you."
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:32.300]   Never will have that problem again.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:34.300]   I use privacy everywhere.
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:35.660]   You just press pause.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:37.220]   Privacy blocks the charges.
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.820]   They'll notify if they try to charge over the allotted amount.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:43.980]   You'll see all that every time the card is declined so you'll know immediately if somebody's
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:47.540]   trying to steal it or use it inappropriately.
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:48.940]   It's also great for card sharing.
[01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:55.540]   So I often create cards for my mom, for instance, she cooked for me her whole life.
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:56.540]   She's 88 now.
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:58.460]   She's kind of tired of cooking.
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:00.420]   I said, "Mom, let me buy you dinner.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:02.820]   She's out your way, Andy, in Rhode Island."
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:06.300]   So I sent her a privacy card and I said, "Use this.
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:11.820]   Just know that when you use it for a restaurant or a meal delivery, the only ones that can
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:13.180]   use it ever again."
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:16.060]   So keep using it for that service.
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:17.820]   And a nice see whenever she uses it.
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:19.340]   It's kind of a nice feeling.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:23.620]   But I didn't have to text her a card number or any further.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:26.620]   I just used the privacy.com card sharing.
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:30.100]   Went to the website, created the card, gave them her email address.
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:31.100]   They took care of the rest.
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:33.540]   She doesn't have to have a privacy account.
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:38.340]   It's a secure way to make sharing a credit card number very, very easy.
[01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:40.460]   You'll get complete account summaries.
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.660]   You can tag purchases now.
[01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:45.860]   So it really gives you a lot of control over how you're viewing it, how you're sorting
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:46.860]   it.
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:48.660]   I love privacy.com.
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:49.660]   Check it out.
[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:51.860]   Protect your financial identity online.
[01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:56.620]   Using virtual cards, I've literally created hundreds of them.
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.580]   Privacy.com/twit.
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:02.580]   You get $5 for a new account, $5 to spend on your first purchase.
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:05.500]   This is a nice way of saying welcome.
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:06.860]   Privacy.com/twit.
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:08.460]   Sign up right now.
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:11.700]   New customers get $5 to spend on their first purchase automatically.
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:14.940]   I just think this is such a great idea.
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:17.780]   Used to be companies used to do this.
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:22.180]   I remember, I think a couple of my credit card companies used to do it, and they stopped.
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.180]   They stopped.
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:25.740]   Now I just do it with privacy all the time.
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:34.540]   A really good way of protecting yourself online privacy.com/twit.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:36.780]   We thank them so much for supporting Twit.
[01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:41.820]   We had a fun week this week on Twit, and we've got a little mini movie to show you all the
[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:42.820]   good stuff.
[01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:45.100]   So what does it take to repair an iPhone?
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:49.900]   If you ask Apple, they'll ship you two gigantic boxes and say good luck.
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:51.620]   Previously on Twit.
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:57.660]   I wanted to give people an idea of what it's like to actually go through Apple's self-service
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:58.900]   repair program.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:03.860]   And only two of the three shipments that were supposed to be coming actually arrived.
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:07.660]   As soon as you get the tools, your seven-day rental period begins.
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:08.900]   But I can't do the repair.
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:11.100]   I can't use the tools until I get the battery.
[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:16.660]   If I don't get these sent back to UPS tomorrow, then that $1,100 temporary charge will stay
[01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:17.820]   on the card.
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:18.820]   Windows Weekly.
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:22.020]   The second version of Windows 11, 22H2, is complete.
[01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:24.420]   Oh, but that is a big story.
[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:27.660]   I just feel like our expectations about Windows have to change.
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:31.940]   Like we used to be thinking there'd be some huge feature or something secret.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:33.420]   That's not going to happen anymore, right?
[01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:36.740]   Well, we know what one of them is, is that tabbed file explorer.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:37.740]   No.
[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:38.740]   No.
[01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:39.740]   No.
[01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:40.740]   Okay.
[01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:43.140]   I feel like the crusher of dreams this week in Google.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:50.740]   Seth Green decided that he would like to make a board ape cartoon show until his board
[01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:52.380]   ape got stolen.
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:58.020]   Darkwing 84 could sue Seth Green because technically he owns the copyright.
[01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:59.020]   Wait, I did it.
[01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:01.620]   Counselor, is that the case or not?
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:02.620]   I roll.
[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:03.620]   I roll.
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:05.460]   There's so much going wrong here.
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:06.980]   This is not how it works.
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:07.980]   To it.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:10.500]   This actually makes copyright look good.
[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:11.780]   And I would say that.
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:16.260]   Unbelievable as always.
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:22.020]   Let's quickly check the Elon Musk Twitter feed just to see the latest.
[02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:25.700]   Here is a picture of Elon setting the bird free.
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:26.700]   I don't know.
[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:28.500]   You make of it what you want.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:32.780]   He's trying to get out of the deal, I think, or at least get the price down.
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:37.300]   His Twitter shareholders are now suing him saying you better pay 5420.
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:47.300]   Incidentally, Elon stole this cartoon from a cartoonist and did not give credit where
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:50.060]   credits do, but we're going to do that.
[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:56.660]   Somebody posted in a response to Elon, the original cartoon with the Chinese artist's
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:01:00.460]   name clearly visible.
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:01.460]   Exactly.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:02.460]   Look at Elon's post.
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:03.620]   He erased it.
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:04.700]   He erased it.
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:05.940]   And then posted it.
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:07.740]   Not cool, Elon.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:10.420]   Not cool.
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:13.300]   And I think Elon just loves to stir up the trouble.
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:16.340]   So forget it.
[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:18.140]   Forget it.
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:21.380]   He went from hero to villain so quickly.
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:22.380]   No kidding.
[02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:30.100]   Like it's just ridiculous how quickly he was like just like he was, you know, this wonder.
[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:31.700]   He's going to do all these great things.
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:32.700]   And now he's kind of.
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:34.500]   He's a jerky jerk.
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:35.820]   I mean, he's a jerk.
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:41.540]   He by the way, three years ago, he tweeted, I wish people would stop crediting artists on
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:45.780]   Twitter when any fool could find out who the artist was in seconds.
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:46.780]   Oh, okay.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:48.980]   Well, obviously not every fool.
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:50.980]   I found one.
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:51.980]   Good Lordy.
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:58.700]   Well, that's kind of proactive, I guess, you know, he knew he was three years later
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:00.780]   going to do that.
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:02.620]   Peter Teal, his left meadow's board.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:07.860]   He got a board seat when he was one of the very first people to support Twitter.
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:15.100]   I think it was a half million dollar investment that turned into billions for Peter Teal.
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:17.500]   I'm not sure why he's leaving the board.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:19.900]   And I'll show it off.
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:21.620]   It'll make a difference.
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:25.580]   If I were if I were on the board of any social media company, I would think this might be
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:31.420]   a great time to take the money and run.
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:33.180]   Mark is being personally sued.
[02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:39.100]   Mark Zuckerberg by the District of Columbia Attorney General over the Cambridge Analytica
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:40.100]   scandal.
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:44.500]   That was five years ago.
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:47.180]   But he says, "Mark ought to know personally."
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:53.300]   So he's being personally sued saying Zuckerberg was directly responsible for creating the
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:03:01.380]   lax privacy rules that allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest data about Facebook users.
[02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:07.580]   Back in 2015 and 2016.
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:15.540]   Twitter has to pay $150 million over privacy violations.
[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:16.540]   Facebook did this first.
[02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:17.540]   Twitter did it too.
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:21.500]   You know how they asked for a phone number for authentication, you know, backup or recovery
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:22.500]   number.
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:26.900]   It turns out Facebook and Twitter both use that then for advertising purposes.
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:31.300]   The company was sued by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:37.580]   They've settled for a mere $150 million.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:45.300]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, I finally had to cave in and give Facebook and Instagram my
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:47.740]   phone number for two-factor authentication.
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:49.700]   And I'm like, "Nothing good."
[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:50.700]   No.
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:52.700]   Nothing good can come of this.
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:57.060]   It's two-factor authentication is important.
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:59.420]   But what would you do?
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:00.420]   Andy.
[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:01.420]   Andy.
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:02.420]   Yeah.
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:03.420]   Well, that's when I left.
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:06.460]   Actually, I'm still on Twitter.
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:09.540]   But now I know they've been using that.
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:11.420]   Do you know Halsey, the recording artist?
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:12.420]   I love her music.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:14.500]   I think she's quite good.
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:22.620]   She posted a TikTok on saying, "Well, I'll read you the text."
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:25.100]   She's actually playing her newest song.
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.380]   I won't do it because I don't want TikTok to take us down.
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:33.220]   But she says, "Basically, I have a song that I love that I want to release ASAP, but my
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:36.220]   record label won't let me."
[02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:38.460]   I'm in this industry for eight years, says Halsey.
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:41.740]   I've sold over 165 million records.
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:48.460]   But my record company says, "I can't release this song unless they can fake a viral moment
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:50.820]   on TikTok."
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:54.380]   Everything is marketing and they're doing this basically to every artist these days.
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:58.140]   I just want to release music, man, and I deserve better to be honest.
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:59.140]   I'm tired.
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:02.860]   Eight million views in 24 hours for that video.
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:09.900]   So I guess the record company's going to release this song.
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:13.180]   Isn't there a subreddit about that entitled "Malicious Compliance"?
[02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:14.180]   Yeah.
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:15.180]   Exactly.
[02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:21.340]   It is too bad when, you know, she's at 165 million records.
[02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:27.380]   She's obviously a very successful artist.
[02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:32.580]   This is what labels are just not pulling their weight.
[02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:38.420]   The power that a creator has to forge their own path, build their own audience, and then
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:42.260]   monetize that audience on their own without dealing with crap like this.
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:45.900]   I mean, I think there are a lot of people, there are a lot of artists that said, "We
[02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:51.260]   can either give you the chance of being as big as the Foo Fighters, but you'll have to
[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:54.220]   deal with record labels and all that kind of management."
[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:59.500]   Or you could make an extremely good living off of your music for the rest of your life
[02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:05.220]   limited to not being a cajillionaire, but you will never have to deal with the text message
[02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:09.860]   saying, "Yeah, we're not liking the thumbnail that you've got on your TikTok.
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:14.140]   Can you make it more of an astonished face because there's a study that says if you have
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:18.020]   an astonished face that people will click on it more?"
[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:23.500]   I'm trying to coalesce all of human misery and experience into a simple, spiffy three
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:25.620]   and a half minute song.
[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:27.460]   I don't care about thumbnails.
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:35.460]   But I have to say, Georgia, your astonished faces are very good on your TikTok videos.
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:37.460]   People do click on the...
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:39.260]   Do you notice that?
[02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:41.060]   Yeah, it works better.
[02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:43.420]   If you're making a weird face.
[02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:44.420]   You're not too bad.
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:45.420]   Renee's...
[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:46.420]   I did too though.
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:49.380]   I've just gone really down that rabbit hole.
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:56.020]   If you're crying or really upset, I'm often crying in the videos, but I don't usually have
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:06:57.020]  ...
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:58.020]   I had one where I didn't...
[02:06:58.020 --> 02:06:59.020]   I do the thumbnails.
[02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:00.020]   They're not from the video.
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:04.220]   They're like, "You didn't make exactly that face and I am disappointed in you."
[02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:05.220]   That's funny.
[02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:07.420]   I'm like, "I do them before."
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:10.140]   You've got a nice rubber face.
[02:07:10.140 --> 02:07:15.140]   You can do some good faces on here.
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:17.820]   It's not as bad as it could be.
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:19.820]   It's not as bad as it could be.
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:20.820]   Some of them are ridiculous.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:21.820]   I'll say it.
[02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:22.820]   Some of them are ridiculous.
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:23.820]   I admit to it.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:24.820]   I admit to it.
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.460]   I have some...
[02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:29.940]   I'm wearing ears and some of them too.
[02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:30.940]   I'm like...
[02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:33.140]   Do pointy ears work well on your YouTube videos?
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:35.580]   I asked my people if the...
[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:39.420]   I did too that I'm mildly cosplayed the people that I'm doing.
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:40.420]   It was a bear.
[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:42.820]   Anyways, and I asked, "Are the ears too much?"
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:44.660]   But my people said, "No, no, no.
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:46.540]   I actually think they're kind of hot."
[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:50.180]   Didn't you have pointy ears on a twit last time you were on?
[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:51.180]   Maybe I was just...
[02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:53.180]   Maybe that was a dream.
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:54.180]   I don't know.
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:55.180]   I don't know.
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:56.180]   I might have been.
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.180]   I'm not sure.
[02:07:57.180 --> 02:07:58.180]   I don't remember.
[02:07:58.180 --> 02:07:59.180]   Why is it pointy ears are hot?
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:00.180]   What is that?
[02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:01.180]   What is that all about?
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:02.180]   Are they?
[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:04.020]   Therapist, you better explain.
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:05.020]   Elves.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:06.020]   That'll be a video.
[02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:07.020]   Sexie elves.
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:08.020]   Elves are awesome.
[02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:12.580]   She can tell you, but I think she's going to have to charge you her hourly rate.
[02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:15.380]   And here's a new definition of "Hutspa."
[02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:22.340]   Elizabeth Holmes has asked the judge to overturn her Theranos convictions because there was
[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:24.340]   insufficient evidence.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:33.620]   Apparently, even though the jury convicted her, her attorney says, "No rational juror."
[02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:35.020]   What if convicted her?
[02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:39.460]   "No rational juror could have found the elements of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.780]   fraud beyond a reasonable doubt."
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:42.780]   Your Honor.
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:48.220]   Throw out those four fraud related charges she was convicted on in January.
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:50.460]   She's due to be sentenced in September.
[02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:53.300]   Maybe, this is just what you do.
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:54.300]   Maybe I don't know.
[02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:55.300]   I'm not a lawyer.
[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:56.980]   You just say, "You're on her.
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:59.260]   That jury's nuts."
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:05.060]   Maybe someone gave her, she's paying for it through an Amazon gift card or something.
[02:09:05.060 --> 02:09:08.580]   There's still under the $30,000 left on the card.
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:10.900]   If she doesn't use it, it's going to expire any year.
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:15.980]   She may as well just have the lawyer just keep running until the card is expired.
[02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:22.220]   What interesting thing for me about her is that she faked how deep her voice is.
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:23.220]   I know.
[02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:24.220]   She talked like this.
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:25.220]   I know.
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:28.500]   That's the coolest thing to me that she actually planned that out.
[02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:34.460]   This was really serious thought out stuff to be able to have people give her more money
[02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:38.380]   that they would trust her more because when they think of the deeper voice.
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:46.340]   A more positive look on it, which is the feminist take, which is as a woman entrepreneur, she
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:51.900]   probably thought having too feminine of a voice, she might face discrimination in the
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:52.900]   market.
[02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:56.980]   She decided she should sound more authoritative with a deeper voice.
[02:09:56.980 --> 02:10:02.620]   It was a little weird, but I think that maybe the spirit of it was sensible.
[02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:05.020]   I don't know.
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:11.900]   There is a there's a lot that's like you ever go to a walk past a pond and you just look
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:14.540]   at the surface of that frozen water and think that you know what?
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.780]   I'm not even going to.
[02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:17.780]   There's a lot down there.
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:18.780]   Exactly.
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:23.820]   That's a deep plunge and I want no part of that.
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:27.100]   Nicholas, would you say that that would be like consumers?
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:30.420]   Consumers would they like that's like kind of fraud?
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:34.500]   I don't know.
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:35.900]   I was also impressed.
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:39.060]   Wow, this is a long thought out thing.
[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:40.060]   I guess.
[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:41.060]   I don't know.
[02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:44.700]   Did you have to get an Edison unit to review?
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:46.060]   Yeah, really.
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:49.140]   No, I'm afraid that's a trade secret.
[02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:53.420]   Georgia, can you can you try to do a do a can you talk like that?
[02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:56.220]   I can I can try to talk with a much deeper octave voice.
[02:10:56.220 --> 02:10:58.820]   I don't know if any of you sound like Elizabeth Holmes.
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:00.820]   Do I sound like Elizabeth Holmes?
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:01.820]   It sounds like that.
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.820]   So you could you could do that.
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:04.980]   There are more chance you'll give me money.
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:06.020]   You could do that, right?
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:07.820]   Would you ever consider doing that?
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:09.820]   I could try.
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:15.100]   I wish I wish my voice in my head is like one or two octaves deeper than what it actually
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:16.100]   sounds like.
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:17.100]   Right.
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:19.060]   I'm always shocked by how high pitched my voice actually is.
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:20.060]   Right.
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:21.180]   So I wish I sounded like Demi Moore.
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:26.220]   I think that she has an I would like that would be my favorite voice but unfortunately
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:28.540]   that isn't why I ended up with a really kind of high.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.540]   I like your voice.
[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:30.860]   You don't need to fake it.
[02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:31.860]   Absolutely not.
[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:32.860]   That's silly.
[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:34.580]   It's just it's it.
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:35.580]   You know, I'm not going to.
[02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:37.180]   When I'm sick, I have a deeper voice.
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:38.180]   Yes.
[02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:40.780]   Oh, when you first wake up.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:42.580]   Hello.
[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:44.660]   Last payphone in New York City.
[02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:47.460]   The last one owned by the city is removed.
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:53.500]   The city once had more than 66,000 public phones, but they've all been replaced by WiFi
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:56.540]   kiosks and there it goes.
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:57.540]   The last public.
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:12:03.780]   They privately owned payphones in New York, although I know somebody who owns them or
[02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:09.500]   some of them and he says they're all cell phones.
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:12.860]   They just they're just cell phones.
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:15.700]   The last of the public payphones will not end up in a landfill.
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:25.780]   It's going to go to the museum of the city of New York to be an exhibit for young people.
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:31.380]   The used to have to have a dime that you can go and call home.
[02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:36.820]   I hope if they're if they're curating this prop this correctly, they're going to a they're
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:41.260]   going to scrub that down and disinfect it really well, but also they're going to find
[02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:44.700]   some chemical they can apply to it that smells like it's recently.
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:48.820]   Can I just point out this phone is clearly already been sanitized.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:54.340]   There's no way a payphone in New York City looks as clean as that somebody before the
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:56.940]   photo op cleaned this sucker off.
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:12:58.860]   There's no graffiti carpet ready.
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:00.620]   There's no vomit.
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:03.180]   There's no phone books are intact.
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:09.460]   Yeah, this is this is like this perfectly clean respectable pigeons pigeons.
[02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:12.660]   Anyway, there's going to be no no independent band stickers on it.
[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:17.100]   That's that's usually you go to pay phones just to find out what bands are up and coming
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:18.940]   next time I'm in New York.
[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:22.900]   That's right with all the pamphlets next time of New York, I'm going to this the Museum
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:29.500]   of the City of New York analog city NYC BC before computers.
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:31.660]   What it looked like before computers.
[02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:33.420]   I think that sounds great.
[02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:38.180]   You know, I was I was looking things up because I was trying to find some answers for myself
[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:41.300]   about why they were existing for for quite so long.
[02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:45.260]   And there are a lot of there are a lot of questions on Quora from like people who are
[02:13:45.260 --> 02:13:48.220]   not like below the age of like 25.
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.220]   What is asking?
[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:52.860]   Well, but but but if but if but like, okay, but if if the phone rang, like, you know,
[02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:56.020]   like how would the how would you know who the call was for?
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:59.060]   And like did people used to line up to use it?
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:03.980]   And I'm like, oh, let me paint you a word picture.
[02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:07.740]   About a child by the name of Andy and not go nine or 10 years old.
[02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:11.380]   His allowance was a mere pit and he would go for long walks, sticking his finger in the
[02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:17.100]   coin return slots, hoping to find enough change that been left behind to buy perhaps a Coca-Cola
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:19.820]   or a host is lemon fruit pie.
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:22.260]   Oh, are you old enough, George?
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:24.260]   You're going to remember pay phones?
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:25.260]   I do.
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:26.780]   I do remember pay phones.
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:30.180]   I can't say that there were tons of pay phones, but I do remember pay phones.
[02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:31.780]   Do you ever did you ever use them?
[02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:34.180]   Let me ask you, was it a dime or a quarter?
[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:36.780]   Because it you know, dime really shows your age.
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:37.780]   Two quarters.
[02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:38.780]   I don't remember.
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:39.780]   I don't know.
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:40.780]   I'm not sure.
[02:14:40.780 --> 02:14:41.780]   I'm not sure.
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:46.140]   They looked like just a a a health nightmare.
[02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:51.620]   I mean, this is a a phone that's been sitting on the street of New York for years.
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:54.180]   And you're going to put this up to your mouth?
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:56.460]   It just seems like a bad idea.
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:00.300]   We were held cast back in the 80s and 90s.
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:05.660]   I was going to say about a decade ago, I did a story on on the pay phones in New York City
[02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:06.660]   and a guy.
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:07.660]   You did?
[02:15:07.660 --> 02:15:08.660]   Wait a minute.
[02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:09.660]   Yes.
[02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:10.660]   We got the we got the expert on the show.
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:12.180]   I didn't even know that as it happens.
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:13.180]   Yeah.
[02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:16.900]   No, but I spoke to the guy and he said that the phone service was like incidental to the
[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:20.980]   like the money was was the ads into the movie coming up.
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:25.180]   So that's those things were basically just billboards, even a decade ago.
[02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:28.100]   I don't I don't know how many folks were using them as like telephones.
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:29.700]   Oh, that's interesting.
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:30.700]   Yeah.
[02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:33.020]   The guy was like, I don't there's no one's making phone calls.
[02:15:33.020 --> 02:15:35.260]   These things are they are billboards.
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:37.100]   So I thought it was 2011.
[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:44.620]   So yeah, the FCC says that in 1999 was peak cell phone with 2.1 million, but then by the
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:46.980]   early 2010s, it was down by 90%.
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:50.220]   And then by two or three years after that, it was down another half after that.
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:53.780]   And I think that now they're saying that the last piece of hard data I could find was
[02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:59.540]   that in 2016, there were way fewer than 100,000 in the entire country.
[02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:07.700]   So these days does Superman, where does he where does he change?
[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:10.100]   Does he go into a phone booth?
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:15.580]   Hey, you know, that Superman that Superman, the the original motion picture, like he tried
[02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:16.580]   to find a phone booth.
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:18.220]   He could only find one of those little like elements.
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:19.220]   Oh, that's right.
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:20.220]   Yeah.
[02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:22.220]   And easy being Superman, man.
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:23.460]   Well, wait a minute.
[02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:28.780]   Now, if if you would like, you can buy a phone booth.
[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:33.620]   This is from cubicle booth.com.
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:37.500]   Enjoy personal space for those important conversations.
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:42.780]   Easy installation ships flat, build with 60 minutes with just a few tools.
[02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:43.940]   Wait a minute.
[02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:44.940]   I wonder how.
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:49.180]   Oh, even the even the phone booths have been removed.
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:50.780]   Oh, 404.
[02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:52.780]   I thought I had.
[02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:57.420]   I was going to say speaking of ocean plastics, we're building phone booths.
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:58.420]   Geez.
[02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:01.100]   Oh, no, they still sell them.
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:05.460]   Fumboots, custom phone booths and isolation solutions.
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:11.300]   Maybe you could have a little phone booth therapy office somewhere in downtown Montreal,
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:15.940]   Georgia Dow, go to youtube.com/georgydow.
[02:17:15.940 --> 02:17:20.220]   You can email her if you need help, Georgia at westmounttherapy.com.
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:24.740]   Of course, it's not for emergencies, but she's there to talk to people.
[02:17:24.740 --> 02:17:35.060]   And she also has some really great videos that I highly recommend on anxiety, parenting,
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:36.820]   sleeping, depression.
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:38.700]   They're all at anxiety-videos.com.
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:43.380]   Do you still get orders for DVDs or is it all online now?
[02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:47.500]   It's all mostly online.
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:52.020]   So very few people, there's still some people that will ask, but like most people will just
[02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:53.020]   download it.
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:54.020]   It's kind of cool.
[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:55.660]   I'm going to keep these.
[02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:58.740]   These are collector's items in my phone booth.
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:02.820]   They're great coasters for like drinks and stuff.
[02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:05.940]   Anxiety-videos.com.
[02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:06.940]   Get the DVD.
[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:08.220]   It's a collector's item.
[02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:09.220]   Thank you, Georgia.
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:11.220]   It's really great to see you.
[02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:12.220]   Thanks for having me.
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:15.260]   You said your next thing is Stranger Things.
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:16.660]   You're going to do the health.
[02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:17.660]   Next thing is Stranger Things.
[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:18.660]   Healthfire Club.
[02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:24.660]   I don't have the link, but I have my Nebula class that's going to be coming up.
[02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:29.340]   So if you get the Nebula, my class is like launching on Tuesday, which is on dealing
[02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:30.340]   with anxiety.
[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:35.580]   It's just a full class and it's brand new.
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:37.740]   And I think it's nebula.app/georgidow.
[02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:38.740]   Nice.
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:44.980]   So I'm kind of excited to go to New York and film a whole class on dealing with anxiety.
[02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:47.260]   So that's kind of a new thing that I'm excited about.
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:49.740]   That's really cool.
[02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:53.340]   So Nebula is kind of like the subscription service.
[02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:57.140]   Your videos and Renee's videos are part of.
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:18:58.940]   And Renee's videos and yeah.
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:00.740]   Really cool.
[02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:04.140]   It's really a really nice streaming service that you are able to get.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:07.020]   And then yeah, you get to get the classes.
[02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:10.100]   So this is like a special like master's class kind of thing.
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:11.820]   I don't know if I'm allowed to say master's class.
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:13.980]   That might be copyrighted, but it's like that.
[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:16.460]   In your case, it's a mistress class.
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:17.980]   How about that?
[02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:21.820]   I don't think they own that.
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:26.060]   It is nebula.app/georgidow.
[02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:27.060]   Thank you, Georgia.
[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:29.220]   It's always so nice to see you.
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:30.620]   Thank you for being here.
[02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:34.020]   Andy Enoco, I see you every week, but I still love hearing from you.
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:37.980]   He is at IHNATKO.com.
[02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:43.820]   You'll hear him on Thursdays and sometimes Fridays in WGBH Boston.
[02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:46.260]   And every Tuesday on MacBrick Weekly.
[02:19:46.260 --> 02:19:51.900]   Plus don't forget if you're into Android, his material podcast that he does with Florence
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:54.820]   Ion on Relay.fm.
[02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:55.820]   Anything else?
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:57.620]   Have I plugged it all?
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:02.420]   I think you've plugged it on a month Thursday this week at 12.50 in the morning.
[02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:07.780]   You can stream it live or later at WGBHNews.org or go there to find any of the weekly tech
[02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:09.020]   roundups, news, ronks.
[02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.620]   I've done it for the past three or four years.
[02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:13.260]   And enjoy Bob's Burgers.
[02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:14.260]   I will.
[02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:15.820]   Again, I've got the Burgers.
[02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:18.420]   It wasn't just the, it wasn't just this movie theater.
[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:23.300]   It was the, I've got to find a movie theater with a really great burger place independently
[02:20:23.300 --> 02:20:27.940]   owned within like a 20 minute walk afterward because it would be a damn shame to watch
[02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:31.420]   the feature film and then not get a great burger after.
[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:34.140]   I'm really curious where that where that could be.
[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:35.620]   So you're going to go see it when?
[02:20:35.620 --> 02:20:37.620]   What are you going to see Bob's Burgers?
[02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:38.620]   Probably Wednesday.
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:39.620]   Wednesday.
[02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:40.620]   I was going to do it.
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:44.100]   I was going to do it Monday, but I did that freelancer thing where I forgot that this was
[02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:45.300]   actually a holiday weekend.
[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:46.300]   Oh, that thing.
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:51.020]   Because stupid me, I was working on Friday and Friday and Saturday because you know, you
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:52.100]   got to work.
[02:20:52.100 --> 02:20:56.420]   But yeah, I'm glad you know, we actually had a hard time getting people for today's show
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:20:57.980]   because of the Memorial Day weekend.
[02:20:57.980 --> 02:20:58.980]   So I'm glad you did that.
[02:20:58.980 --> 02:20:59.980]   Too many clambics.
[02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:00.980]   Yeah.
[02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:02.300]   Also, it's also it's a Sunday.
[02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:03.500]   So most people are at mass.
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:04.980]   So yeah, right.
[02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:10.620]   Nicholas Day, lay on the wonderful senior electronics reporter at Consumer Reports.
[02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:14.900]   We love your work and I'm going to have to go find your phone booth article now.
[02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:15.900]   That's a stir.
[02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:17.660]   Oh, that's long, long, long to leave.
[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:18.660]   Was that for five?
[02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:19.660]   That was news corpse.
[02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:20.660]   No, that was news corpse.
[02:21:20.660 --> 02:21:21.660]   The daily.
[02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:22.660]   The daily.
[02:21:22.660 --> 02:21:23.660]   Yes.
[02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:24.660]   Yes.
[02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:25.660]   That was right.
[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:26.660]   Earlier.
[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:27.660]   I forgot you worked on.
[02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:28.660]   Long gone.
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:29.660]   Nice newsroom that they had.
[02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:31.660]   And then they shut it down.
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:32.660]   Gone gone.
[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:33.660]   It was fun.
[02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:36.900]   Well, I'll ask today is great to have you on Nicholas.
[02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:37.900]   Thank you for the work you do.
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:39.780]   I'll look forward to your review of office chairs.
[02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:40.780]   I can't wait.
[02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:43.420]   Yeah, if I may, that's coming up probably this week.
[02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:46.460]   We did a big kind of test on ergonomic office chairs.
[02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:47.740]   So that's coming up this week.
[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:51.100]   Probably next month we'll have a thing on gaming chairs.
[02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:52.100]   Similar story.
[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:53.100]   Okay.
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:57.340]   And if folks want to plug another random story that folks might like, we did a story recently
[02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:59.420]   on how to delete a bunch of email.
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:04.300]   I basically deleted more than 100,000 emails from my email account over the span of like
[02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:06.380]   a day in James.
[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:09.180]   So folks maybe listening maybe know how to do that.
[02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:13.580]   But if you're like the family tech guy and you want to help folks kind of like manage
[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:16.380]   the email, we've got some tips in there that may be helpful.
[02:22:16.380 --> 02:22:19.980]   So, wow, that's like somebody with long hair getting their haircut.
[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:21.500]   That's like kind of wow.
[02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:22.660]   Yeah, no, it was funny.
[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:24.260]   I was deleting so many emails.
[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:25.780]   I lost access to my account.
[02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:27.180]   It kept airing out.
[02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:31.980]   Like I assume Google thought that I was like hacking my account because I'm deleting thousands
[02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:33.780]   at a clip.
[02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:39.420]   You know, I had the account going back to 2008 or so and deleted maybe five emails over
[02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:41.860]   the life of the account.
[02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:43.740]   I just kind of marked as red and moved on.
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:44.740]   Yeah, I save everything.
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:46.420]   I don't want to delete emails.
[02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:47.420]   That's my history.
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:49.180]   They're all gone now.
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:51.180]   100,000 emails.
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:52.180]   Yeah.
[02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:53.180]   Wow.
[02:22:53.180 --> 02:23:00.380]   Well, I also want to wish everybody a pleasant Memorial Day weekend.
[02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:05.820]   This is the tomorrow is the day we remember those who have given their lives in the service
[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:07.780]   of this country.
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:11.460]   And we don't want to forget that because that's the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:17.140]   So while you're thinking about that and remembering that, I do hope you also remember to have
[02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:19.620]   a great Memorial Day weekend.
[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:23.060]   And we will see you on Twit next week.
