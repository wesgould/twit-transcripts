[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.560]   We're going to talk about the biggest week in the history of Microsoft ever, ever, ever
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.400]   with our panel starting to my left, Father Robert Balaser.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.720]   We call him Friar Tech or Padre S.J. in the chat room.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.720]   Either way works.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.400]   It's hard to buy back from the techstop.net podcast.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.920]   He's the Pope's IT guy.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.280]   Actually, it's not true, but you did.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.440]   Didn't you work to set up Skype for the Pope?
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.600]   Skype and another teleconferencing system that they don't want to mention.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   Oh, really?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.560]   We ripped it out.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   We did the same thing.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   It was the same one.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.280]   Anyway, nice to have you Friar Tech.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.320]   I should say Robert is going to be the host of a brand new show on Twit.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.440]   We'll talk about that a little bit later.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.800]   I'm also sitting to my right.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.200]   It's great to have Ryan Blockback.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.440]   It's been a long time from Gadget.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   Good to see you.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   Thank you.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   Congratulations.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.840]   I know everybody knows what I'm talking about here because it was a very public...
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.440]   Oh, it wasn't that public.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.640]   Okay, never mind.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.040]   Well, no, I mean, you tweeted it.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   You tweeted it.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   I got engaged.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   I got a Bell money.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.880]   Former game on host.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.440]   It was so cute because you guys...
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.560]   I mean, she posted a picture, then you posted a picture.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.040]   It was really sweet.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.920]   This was an example of social media.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.240]   And everybody I think who follows you probably considers you both kind of friends, not strangers,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.960]   not distant celebrities, but actually friends.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.960]   We try to have like a very cordial conversation with that.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   It was really sweet.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   It was really neat.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   It thrilled me.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.880]   I started Instagram and then Facebook.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.280]   It was just very exciting.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.880]   I heard through the grapevine that you were planning something today.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.080]   Well, there's a priest here for a reason.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   Just I'm just saying.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.280]   I don't think Veronica's in the room.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.080]   She must have done that.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080]   She's running.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   It's okay.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.200]   I can do it over Skype.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.080]   Also with this over Skype, Larry Maggot is here from CBS Radio.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.600]   It's great to see you again, Larry.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   Good to be here.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Lewis, good to be here.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.920]   Leo, sorry I couldn't be in Petaluma today, but it's a long commute and the pride parade
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.520]   is in San Francisco, which is very cool, but it means more traffic.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.280]   Yeah, you can't really get anywhere.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.680]   Yeah, we drove through it.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   It was brutal.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.680]   Park in Lumbar, where were we?
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.680]   Well, thank you for coming up here.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.680]   Thank you, Larry, for being here.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   That's the beauty of Skype, really.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680]   And it's, I love it.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.520]   We just put it, we put you at the table and we call it an avatar.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   You're just there in a screen.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.600]   Every coffee from the other room, like everybody else.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.120]   Yeah, no, you have to get your own.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   That's the difference.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.320]   You've got to get your own coffee and my dog won't lick your toes.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   I got my own dog.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320]   Okay, good.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.320]   We're got the proxy.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.880]   So is it hyperbole of me to say the biggest week in the history of Microsoft, from Microsoft's
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   point of view?
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.360]   Larry, did you go down?
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.520]   No, I was in Washington, DC, but it was a big week.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.760]   I mean, between tablets and phone operating systems, I don't know, the biggest, does it
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.720]   beat Windows 95 or Windows 3.0?
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720]   It's probably not.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   It's pretty big.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.040]   It's a big deal for them because they're betting the company on Metro.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.960]   They're betting the company on their own hardware or rumor is that they may have their
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   own phone.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.600]   That's a huge departure for Microsoft.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.200]   So maybe it is the biggest week.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.320]   It isn't a new Ryan Block.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   You weren't there either.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   I did not go.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.320]   No.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.640]   I mean, it was definitely the biggest week I can think of since the Xbox 360 launch.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.280]   You know, I do remember when the main Xbox, the first Xbox launch, that was a pretty big
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280]   one.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.960]   But the 360, I think it was much bigger.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   360.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.680]   But I have to say this to me is huge because Microsoft's changing its business model.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   Really good.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.120]   John Gruber wrote a piece about it on Daring Fireball, referring back to a guy named Didi
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.640]   U and I don't from a Simco blog.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   I don't know.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.240]   But he wrote, I thought, a very intelligent piece in which he essentially said, do the
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.560]   numbers and what Microsoft realized was the writing on the wall.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.880]   They made all their money selling expensive software on commodity hardware.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.600]   And really, I mean, we always, to war, I could always joke, well, whose wallet would you
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.240]   rather have Bill Gates or Steve Jobs?
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.800]   It's better to be in a low overhead software business because it's all profit.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.200]   But all of a sudden that seems to have changed and Apple has proved that in fact there's
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:51.080]   more profit in doing inexpensive software on very expensive hardware.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.880]   And Deggio's premises, Microsoft saw the curves intersecting and said, we've got to
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   do something about this.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.200]   I mean, I don't think that they're looking at it as they're going to make money on the
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   software.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.920]   I think that they're looking at it as one, you know, owning the whole banana, as we say.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.280]   And a lot of this actually kind of goes back before the iPhone as we really started to
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.520]   adopt mobile devices, something changed.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.840]   And that was we had integrated experiences and, you know, that means, at least in my
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.680]   opinion, you know, a software stack and a hardware stack that are very closely tied together
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.080]   and that are not necessarily commoditized.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.160]   And if they don't work well together, the whole thing falls apart.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.560]   And so we started getting used to this and then Apple raised the game with the iPhone.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.800]   And then all of a sudden it stopped being about operating system and hardware and, you
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.680]   know, pick your hardware, pick your operating system.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.880]   It became single great experiences that people came to expect.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   Right.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.680]   And I think that that's what Microsoft really realizes.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.720]   You have to at some point sooner or later to match the great experiences other companies
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.640]   are creating, you have to own the whole banana.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.440]   Horace says that by doing a little division, Microsoft, if you include the office licenses
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.240]   and the windows licenses makes about $78 of operating profit per PC sold.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.360]   Remember they don't make the PC.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.720]   They just make the software.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.200]   He says Apple, if we do a little math, makes $195 per iPad sold.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.520]   And as iPads start to outsell PCs.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.200]   We're talking about Surface.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.640]   Well, yeah, well, I mean, they're not having to do Surface because we're only doing the
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.800]   software and then of course Lenovo and Dell and HP are doing the hardware.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.160]   There's not much margin in hardware in the PC.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.240]   Well, this is a major competitive disadvantage that they had for their hardware partners
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.200]   in the tablet space because I think what I'd read and I don't have this confirmed yet
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.600]   because I'm not sure if the final OEM pricing is out.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.720]   But I think I'd read that they were going to charge $75 to $85 for Windows RT, which
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.440]   is their version of iOS.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.040]   So that would be the licensing cost to our tablet management.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.800]   Right, so if I'm Asus and I want to create a Windows based tablet, I'm going to have to
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.600]   pay $75 just for the OS, which if you look at the breakdown of what goes into one of
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.800]   these things, $75 is enormous.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.120]   That's more that's at part or maybe even slightly more than the incredible display on
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.120]   the iPad.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.280]   Ryan, isn't that a game killer for the third party ecosystem?
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.640]   It's a huge competitive disadvantage to those guys because they can't compete on price with
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.200]   anyone else if they have to do $75 cost for the OS.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.640]   So for Microsoft, that actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.960]   Plus the fact, I don't know how good the hardware is going to finally be when we see
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.800]   the actual final version of it.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.160]   But I would guess that Microsoft's going to do a really good job on the Surface tablet
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.400]   relative to other companies that are going to create tablets using the same software.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.520]   In fact, I think Google did a superb job on its phones relative to HTC and some of the
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.680]   other players in terms of the branding.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   And so I think that essentially they're going to kill the entire ecosystem, which I don't
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.680]   get it in that sense.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.520]   I mean, I don't know about that.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.960]   I think they're going to kill, I agree that they're going to kill the ecosystem on the
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.760]   tablet, on Windows RT.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.120]   But I think that there's still, I mean, look at Dell, Lenovo, HP, they've still got
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.120]   to sell Windows machines.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.320]   They're going to sell Windows 8, aren't they?
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.520]   Or they're just going to be all Windows 7?
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.000]   What about, you know, Robert, you deal with business, businesses are moving to Windows
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   8?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   No, it's not.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.360]   But this is why you've had in this last week the CEO of Acer came out and essentially
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   he laughed.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.680]   He said they're not going to make this?
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.160]   Yeah, he said Microsoft was going to fail.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.880]   And the reason he gave for them failing is they're creating two products.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.400]   They're creating their own product and they're creating the third party market for the service
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   tablet.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.440]   But you know what they only need one to win.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   They only need one to win.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.480]   And Acer actually bet the farm against tablets.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.880]   At CES this last year they essentially surrendered the tablet market.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.320]   Well, that would be another reason for Microsoft to do tablets.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.600]   Even at Computex, we didn't see a lot of Windows RT tablets, right?
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.840]   I mean, this, it looked like, okay, I'm going to make a prediction.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.600]   I got two predictions.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.160]   And I agree with you, by the way, it's not just financial, it's also because integrating
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.000]   hardware and software makes sense.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.720]   That's Apple's big advantage, right?
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.760]   They give a better user experience.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   I think by doing what they've done, Microsoft's going to, there's two things that are going
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   to happen.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.920]   One, I don't think anybody's going to make a Windows RT tablet.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.520]   I think that it's all going to be Windows 8.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.520]   I don't know about that.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.240]   I think you'll still see people making it.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.200]   The problem is they're going to be, well, go ahead and make sure.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.800]   And there aren't going to be many apps, even though there is, you know, in theory you can
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.840]   push a button when you make a Windows 8 Metro app and it's a Windows RT app.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.360]   I just don't, I think we've seen so many tablets like the playbook, like the zoom, the Android
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.280]   tablet just die because there weren't enough apps for those tablets.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.520]   There's no ecosystem.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.240]   So it's $75.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   It's an unproven system.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.200]   You can make it, you know, it's just going to be difficult.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.040]   You can make an Android tablet if you really want to make a tablet, at least have a shot
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   at it.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.360]   And Microsoft's, you know, kind of in the market.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.680]   So how are you going to compete against Microsoft?
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.240]   So I think this kills Windows RT except for a Microsoft product.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.560]   And I think they'll kill it quickly enough because it's not going to be selling very
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.200]   well with just them making it.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:19.760]   I think it also means Windows 7 gets a end of life in 2025 because I don't think business
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.960]   wants to go to Windows 8.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.720]   I think Microsoft is going to essentially seed the Windows 7 market to little novas,
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   the Dell's.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.640]   They're going to make Windows 8 pro tablets and it's going to be a very different PC world.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.400]   So this is very doom and gloom for you.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.440]   I mean, you think that you think it's going to just, it's going to fail.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.320]   I think Windows RT will fail.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.400]   I think Windows 7's got a long life ahead of it because business needs it and wants
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   it.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.440]   I think Windows 8 is going to take a long time for it to get it.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.080]   I think it's Windows RT doesn't work out just so we're totally clear.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.120]   That is Microsoft's entire tablet strategy right now.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.200]   Yeah, that's tablet.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.240]   But that is not just tablets.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.040]   What about the one that comes out next year that runs regular Windows 8 and that runs
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.040]   the apps?
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.040]   Yeah, so I mean, we've blown apps.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.040]   I guess it's kind of a...
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.040]   That's too fun.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.040]   It's a Windows 8 pro tablet, right?
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   Yeah, it's kind of a pedantic.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   It's not.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   It's not.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.520]   Yeah, it's not really a tablet.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   It's not a tablet like this is a tablet.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.440]   It is basically a slate PC.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.000]   I mean, it's a full Windows PC.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.040]   So I wouldn't really kind of put it on the SAM.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.720]   It's going to cost twice as much.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.080]   It's going to do different things.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.240]   It's not an iPad competitor.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.240]   It's something different.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   See, I see this as driving something else.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.080]   One of the biggest trends that we're seeing in the enterprise right now is BYOD.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.000]   So you've got all these different vendors trying to figure out how to let the users
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.320]   of a network bring the device that they want to bring.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.120]   And that really what that means is smartphones and tablets.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.120]   That happened with the iPhone.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.680]   It's what transformed enterprise phones.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.680]   Exactly.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680]   And it killed RIM.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   And it killed RIM.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.360]   But also what you're seeing is that that's been eroding Microsoft's enterprise lead in
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   that space.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.560]   And they worry about the iPad becoming a dominant enterprise platform.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.560]   I think they are.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.400]   And that's why you've got the Surface RT.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.640]   What they want to do is they want to offer an option for enterprise people to say, if
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.400]   you want a tablet, we can give you one without having to bring your own device.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.240]   We can give you a tablet experience that stays within this network that we've already
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.880]   created, that uses all the same resources that we've already bought.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:24.920]   So I mean, I see that as the real impetus and why Microsoft released what was clearly
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.400]   an underbaked product.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.920]   I mean, no one was able to say that's the other question.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.400]   What was the hurry here and must have been Google I/O?
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.960]   Yeah, definitely I/O.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   Why I/O?
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.600]   Well, I mean, we don't know for sure what it's going to be announced, but we keep hearing
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.040]   about new tablet stuff and we assume they're going to show a new version of Android.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.480]   So not only is Microsoft terrified of Apple, they're terrified of Google.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.960]   Well, as well they should be.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.240]   I mean, there isn't a legitimate player in the tablet space other than Apple right now,
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.320]   but if there was one, it would be Google.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.880]   They're at least closer than the other guys, which are essentially nonexistent.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.200]   I guess what I'm saying is I can't see Windows RT competing with the iPad.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.400]   I think, I mean, look, if you zoom way out, you know, we're at your three of tablets,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.400]   basically.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.200]   And it feels like Microsoft's tablet efforts since 2001.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.480]   Which I don't because again, those were PCs and they were built as PCs.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.120]   So I, you know, it's a different paradigm.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.280]   I think they didn't really know what to do yet.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.800]   Nobody really knew what to do yet.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   They were dabbling.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.200]   We're in your three of tablets.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.640]   I think, you know, let's like zoom ahead 10 years, 15 years when tablets are, you know,
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.520]   what most of us are doing most of our basic computing on and have been for quite some
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.520]   time.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   That could look totally different.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.520]   I noticed you.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.360]   It's hard to say like way, way down the line.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.480]   You didn't bring a laptop.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.720]   You decided to go tablet on.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   Are you doing?
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   I brought a laptop.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   I didn't bring it on.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   So you're on the iPad only.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.480]   I mean, I actually really don't like being iPad only.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.840]   It's not for me.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.640]   If I could only pick one device, it would be my laptop.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.320]   And I feel very weird about, you know, going on vacation with only an iPad.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.480]   It just, it doesn't feel right.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.640]   There's a lot of stuff I know I can't do.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.680]   It's stretch.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.680]   You have to work extra hard.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.680]   You have to bring a keyboard.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.280]   Just bring a laptop for crying out loud.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.440]   And I mean, you got ultra books and MacBook Air.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:18.920]   I mean, the MacBook Air ironically is not that much heavier than the iPad and comes with
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.520]   a full keyboard and all the software you could possibly want.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.200]   And there's some ultra books out there that are going to fit that bill.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.360]   So I think that for those of us that are doing real work, the laptop is still the machine
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.000]   of choice.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.280]   So here's the question, Robert.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:39.400]   Does business, Microsoft argument is, well, you're using Windows in business, you're using
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:45.160]   exchange, you want compatibility, we're going to give you a Microsoft solution that's going
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.320]   to fit better into your enterprise in the iPad.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.760]   But isn't that what BlackBerry said?
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.640]   You've got BlackBerry Enterprise Server.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.480]   Isn't that what the Windows Phone 6 and 6.5 was all about?
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.480]   Well, it integrates better.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.720]   It works with Office.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.920]   And that wasn't compelling when we got to the BYOD era.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.000]   People brought iPhones.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.440]   So Microsoft, I think, is counting on the idea that, well, we'll somehow integrate better
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   into the enterprise.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440]   Right.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   And that's absolutely key.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.600]   And it's something that they have proven they haven't been able to do with that.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.600]   They haven't.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   Nobody has.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.000]   Nobody has a technology with the release of Windows Mobile to tightly integrate it with
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.320]   exchange, to make it a no brainer to be able to use in the enterprise.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   And it's not there.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.720]   It's actually easier to set up an Android phone on exchange server than it is to set
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   up Windows Mobile.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.720]   And that's just, that's ridiculous.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.760]   Well, it is a tech zone.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.000]   Windows sync with Windows Phone.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.240]   Are you talking about Windows Mobile or Windows Phone?
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   You talking about Windows Phone?
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   Windows Phone, I mean, it's right.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.360]   Because Windows Mobile, that was the key feature of Windows Mobile back in the day up to,
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.560]   you know, 6.5 was that it had amazing, it had amazing whatever.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.880]   It had exchange integration.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.440]   And that wasn't enough to save it.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.440]   Right.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.800]   So I think Microsoft probably looked at that and said, okay, well, clearly, you know,
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.840]   having a great office, office enabled product and enterprise enabled product is not what's
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.840]   going to save us.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.400]   So we have to work towards the consumer first and then back our way into that.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.560]   And I actually, I mean, I think that's actually what they're doing.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.400]   So our team consumer products, not what I think is this product.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.080]   They didn't really talk about the business story at this launch.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   I mean, they really didn't.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.720]   It was very, very much a consumer focused launch.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   And I think that's really important.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.400]   I think a lot about business, but I don't think that this is intended to be a business
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   product.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.040]   I think if we're talking about BYOD, they want this to be a device that consumers feel comfortable
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.400]   with and that's how they do it.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.560]   That's how the Apple, which is frankly, it's a strategy they should be taking.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.440]   But I like your analysis of looking at looking at this as year three of tablets because
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440]   we could actually take it back.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.760]   Look, five years, five years ago, everything was a net book.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.280]   We were moving to the net book and then people realized, well, the net book doesn't really
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.120]   have everything I want.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.680]   Tablets became really popular.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.440]   People are now using iPads alone and they realize it doesn't have everything I want.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.400]   And so you've got on the other side, they're bringing out ultra books and the surface seems
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   to be just an ultra book with a touchscreen.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.680]   So it looks as if Microsoft is betting on the, betting the farm on a strategy that says,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.840]   people want devices that are going to be like a tablet, but will increasingly allow you
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.920]   to do more of the things you can expect out of a notebook.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   I think it might feel a very nice niche that way.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:17.520]   I think at least in the higher and heavier version of the surface, Microsoft is also
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.840]   betting that people want to run their Windows software.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.520]   I mean, because there are certainly people who are out there who love their iPad but are
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.320]   frustrated because there's one or two PC or Mac programs that they simply can't run.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.160]   And I do think that there is a market for that.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.360]   But as pointed out, Microsoft has more than 10 years experience coming out with tablets
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.040]   that are basically just little PCs.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.360]   So the question is by having the hybrid with a Metro interface and the desktop, by making
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.560]   it lighter, taking advantage of newer technology, can they finally crack that business market
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.160]   for people who want the tablet that also is a PC?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.800]   They claim it's a great tablet and a great PC, but that really remains to be seen.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.280]   This rarely works.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.760]   Every time you try to balance multiple disparate needs within the electronics world, it almost
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.760]   never works out.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.600]   I mean, Microsoft has made it work once.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.760]   I would say the Xbox 360 is a great example that they created a game console that was
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.360]   also an amazing living room entertainment device.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.760]   But that was something that took them years to slowly develop and they're kind of really
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.000]   just now really fleshing out that side.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.400]   They got the games down and then they moved to the entertainment stuff over the course
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   of two, three years.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.240]   I'm pointing to the one example where it's working, the multifunction device, printer scanner
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.280]   effect, and frankly, when those first came out, there was a lot of question about pardon
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   my camera.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.040]   There's a lot of questions about those too because they weren't all that good.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.360]   But that's about the only thing I can think of that really does multiple things well.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:47.040]   And that's where Apple has succeeded so well is with this very clear laser-like focus,
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.120]   this is it.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.160]   Don't look for a file system.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.200]   Some people said, "Why did an Apple think of putting a keyboard in the smart cover they
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.960]   could have?"
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.040]   And they might still?
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   Or maybe not.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.040]   Maybe that's not.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   Maybe they're freaking...
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   And that's kind of my point.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.280]   Whether or not they do or they don't, I think it comes down to, if you hedge too much, everything
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.280]   suffers.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.160]   And at the end of the day, this is really about creating a great user experience.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.160]   It's designed by committee versus vision.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   Right.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.720]   And so I think Microsoft actually did show some vision here.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.000]   I mean, this could go a couple of ways.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.200]   It could go Xbox or it could go Zoom.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.280]   It could be the dark horse success or it could totally belly flop.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.280]   Is it just those two?
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   Is it very binary?
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.280]   Is it kind of middle-world?
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.160]   Those are our touchstones for Microsoft hardware products.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.440]   But there's quite a division between the Pro and the RT.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440]   I mean, the...
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.440]   They're two steps.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.440]   I think they're really...
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.440]   I think the Pro is DOA.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.440]   And by the way...
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   Pro is DOA RT...
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   Really?
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   Oh, so I always the other way around.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.440]   You think Pro is dead.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   I think...
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.440]   I think...
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440]   I think...
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   I think...
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.440]   I think...
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.440]   Nobody's gonna buy that.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.440]   Nobody's gonna buy that.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   Nobody's gonna buy that.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.440]   It's a weird laptop.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.920]   Why would anybody buy that weird laptop for about $1,000 when you could go buy a MacBook Air?
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   Right.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.480]   And there's some people buying that and adopting it.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   The Pro just makes no sense.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.880]   I mean, we've already seen.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.560]   Slate PCs do not sell.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.160]   They're highly verticalized.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.520]   You see them in the medical industry and that's basically it.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   They don't move.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   Nobody cares about them.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.160]   It's the worst of all worlds.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.920]   But you brought up a very important point.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   That's pricing.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.480]   We still don't have pricing.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.040]   Right.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.560]   We're all assuming that because Microsoft said, "Oh, well, it's gonna be comparable
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   to Ultrabooks that we're looking at the 800-
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.480]   Let's talk about what we don't know.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.960]   There's a lot we don't know."
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   And there's a lot of missing things.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   I want to talk about the event.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.360]   We're talking about Surface and a very big week for Microsoft.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.840]   We haven't even gotten to Windows Phone 8, which they also announced this week.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.000]   And we got the right guy for that with Ryan Block from Gadget, gt.com.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.920]   From on the enterprise side, we've got Father Robert Ballester.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.920]   It's perfect time.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.240]   And you see where Microsoft is in this weird hybrid world, right?
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.160]   And then Larry Magad and I also, who have to explain to consumers that there are two
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.880]   kinds of Windows.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.040]   Windows RT and Windows 8 Pro.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.480]   And how do you explain the difference?
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.480]   Right?
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.960]   So we've got an interesting panel here.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.880]   And it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   We got a lot more to come.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:14.360]   But first I want to talk about our friends at Citrix who are making a great product,
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.360]   even greater.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.880]   If you've ever done support, an IT or if you're a software support, you know about
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   GoToAssist.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.400]   I'm sure GoToAssist is the pioneer in remote support for 10 plus years.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.720]   They've been a cloud based solution.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:37.040]   They are now number one easily for supporting clients and colleagues remotely.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.440]   Eight sessions at once, unattended support, the assay of all the software running in the
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.200]   background, including operating systems.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   Just so great.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.120]   But now they took something great and they made it even better by adding a monitoring
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   module.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.960]   So now GoToAssist is both remote support and monitoring.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   And they really go hand in hand if you're an IT you know how important this is.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:03.520]   You start by putting the GoToAssist crawler on your client's network.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.000]   And it goes out, not only detects all the hardware, but all the network attached devices
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   and all the software.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.440]   So you have a complete set of, this is what's running at that place of business, your clients
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.720]   place of business.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.800]   You then set up a customized dashboard.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.720]   You can use standard dashboards or make some of your own to display stats, track and trend
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:30.480]   key metrics like CPU load averages, memory and disc utilization.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.760]   You can set thresholds.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:38.560]   So if a hard drive is about to run out of space, you'll get an alert via IM SMS or email.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.560]   So you know before there's a problem.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.960]   If the toner cartridge is running low, you can fix it before the client goes, hey, the
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.280]   toner cartridge, that means you're proactive, not reactive.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.200]   It gives you a chance to really give superb support.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.800]   And that's what this is all about is taking you and making you a support hero.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.000]   If you're interested in upping your game, maybe you want to get in managed services,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   this is fantastic.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.840]   RIT guy Russell, three person shop.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.960]   He's a consulting IT guy for us, but we use him about 20 hours a week.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.240]   Three person shop, 855 individual companies he supports.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.760]   How do you do it?
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.040]   With this.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   We set him up with this.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   He's loving it.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.920]   He set us up with it now and we can do all the remote support.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.680]   I can log into the servers from home and see what's going on.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.240]   It's just fantastic.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.000]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.160]   Visit gotoassist.com.

[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.880]   It's blue now.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.880]   They've changed the color.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.040]   The blue try it free button.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.080]   And there's a little expandable area that says promo code.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.600]   If you would use Twitch as the promo code 30 days free, you'll get the full range of,
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.920]   see you check whether you want remote support or monitoring or both.

[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   I think you'll be very, very impressed.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.680]   By the way, 30 days free, you'll never be charged during your free trial.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.400]   Cancel it anytime online.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.200]   24/7 support for you so you can really understand how it works.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.800]   Windows or Mac or iPad, they have iPad support now.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.920]   You support a Windows machine or a Mac from the iPad.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.080]   I should clarify that.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.320]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.320]   Go toassist.com.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   The offer code is "Twit."
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   We thank them.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.680]   Citrix has been such a great support all along for the Twit Network.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.520]   So what about partners?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   This event, if there was a lot of speculation, it was all over the place.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.680]   One thing people really said is, "Well, Microsoft can't get in the business of making PCs
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.720]   because what about the partners?"
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   Obviously, they can.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   Yes, they can.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   And why?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   You can do whatever they want.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   How can they get away with that?
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   They can do whatever they want.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.320]   Can you imagine the calls from Acer Lenovo, Asus, HP?
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.880]   I would say, if Microsoft felt like they could make more money building all their own
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:05.280]   PCs and not licensing their OS, like what Apple does, if Microsoft felt like they could
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.000]   make a go of that, they would do it tomorrow.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.480]   Do you think they're considering it?
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:15.560]   I don't know if Windows really needs it, but at a certain level, this reminds me of...
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.320]   I interviewed Bill Gates a number of years ago, and one of the things that was a little
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.920]   more cogent than that is definitely coming back now is this tension between Microsoft
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.800]   as a hardware company.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.120]   And I asked him, "Why do you do hardware?
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.400]   What is the motivations for you?"
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.240]   He said, "We are always going to do hardware if it makes sense for the software."
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:44.080]   If there's a central component to the combination of hardware and software that necessitates us
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.560]   to be the people to create that.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.480]   And so we saw that in Zoom.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.880]   Zoom is obviously the wrong product, but they had to make it.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.080]   Nobody else was going to make that product.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.600]   And we're seeing that now here.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.160]   It's kind of an elegant situation.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.560]   There was a dominant music player, the iPod, Microsoft was losing ground.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   They had to make something.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.520]   I mean, the problem is they made the wrong product.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.920]   They were fighting the last four instead of fighting the next four.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:13.120]   But it also reminds me of the quote from Alan Kay, that if you're very serious about software,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.240]   you should make your own hardware.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.600]   And I don't know if Microsoft will ever start making their own PCs.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.320]   It wouldn't actually surprise me too much if one day they did that because if you've
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.040]   ever walked into a Microsoft store or know much about how Microsoft stores work, they
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.240]   have a Windows Premium experience, which is basically...
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.800]   They call it the signature.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.960]   Yeah, I'm sorry, signature.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   Thank you.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   Where those basically PCs, they don't have crap where on it.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.000]   Nobody made one except Visio just made one, nobody's made any.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Exactly.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.600]   If you make a PC with outputting crap where on it, they will just shower you with affection
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.320]   and they'll put you all over the Microsoft store and they will sell the hell out of your
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   product.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.920]   Go to signature.microsoft.com and see who's taking them up on that.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.360]   So that to me is they actually do care about the pure Windows experience.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.280]   Oh yeah, they want this.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   Yes.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.880]   But I don't think that they're on the PC side yet.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.600]   Apple's secret sauce all along with the Mac was that they owned the hardware and the
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   software.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.480]   I remember having also an interview with Bill Gates a number of years ago when I talked
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.560]   to him about all the problems with PCs compared to Macs with drivers and all the third party
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   issues.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.440]   All he said was, "Hey, Steve Jobs, or maybe at that point it wasn't Steve Jobs, owns the
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.840]   hardware, owns the software, has a strategic advantage."
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.840]   So Microsoft has always been well aware of that.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.320]   They made a bet early on having this OEM strategy.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.000]   And I can't imagine they're going to abandon that with PCs.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.240]   It would put some companies out of business.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:37.080]   But I do think that going forward they may be very smart to at least have some products
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.520]   like the tablets and that they control all aspects of.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.360]   Yeah, I'm right with you.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.760]   They haven't said that they're going to make their own PC.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.840]   Yeah, you could call the Apple PC.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.160]   No, I think that Pro is a PC.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160]   It's a PC.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.400]   But I mean, you're not going to replace a desktop or all that.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.400]   They still room for a tower.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   Exactly.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.400]   So they could tell their partners, "Look, you can still make all the towers and laptops
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.280]   that you want, but you've proven that you can't make a tablet that competes."
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.240]   You have good context with the OEMs.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.120]   Aren't they going to start pounding the door and saying to Microsoft, "Keep making...
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.040]   We want to be able to sell Windows 7 for at least two more years."
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.400]   Aren't they going to say, "This is our niche.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.760]   We'll take Windows 7."
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.560]   You go ahead with this RT strategy.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.760]   The OEMs will absolutely be saying that.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.080]   They're going to demand that look.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.000]   You owe us something now, Microsoft.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Precisely.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.280]   We want to sell what the consumer wants.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.040]   And we're seeing more and more the consumer doesn't want it.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.840]   On the other side, however, what Microsoft can do if they can pull off making RT and
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:44.720]   Pro a success, which is a big if, but if they can, that would actually drive 8 into the
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.280]   laptop and desktop space.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   You know, it seems to me that the partners don't have a lot of leverage here, though.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   I mean...
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   No, what are they going to do?
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   They're going to make a luster.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.160]   Android is about the only choice, right?
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.600]   No, I'm saying on the desktop.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   Yeah, Android.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   Like computer partners?
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   Yeah, Android.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   On the desktop.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.040]   Well, it's Linux, Android, or if Apple's decided to license it.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.040]   There's nothing.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   They have the...
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   They have the hardware.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   There's nowhere to go.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   You're right.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   That's...
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.120]   I mean, you know, people worried about the partner's situation and like, "Can't believe
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.520]   that Microsoft is doing this."
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.440]   And there's like, "Oh, you know, a lot of dropped jaws right now."
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.400]   I mean, it cracks me up because what are they going to do?
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.120]   You know, Microsoft can do whatever it wants.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.040]   And like, it's in a great position.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   And I actually...
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.480]   I think it's great that they are not compromising to partners when they have the opportunity
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.560]   to create a product that they perceive is a better user experience.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.240]   I mean, ultimately, at the end of the day, that's what this is all about, is about creating
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.240]   better products.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   Right.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   Is all this benefit Apple?
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.160]   I mean, they did this to compete with Apple.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.760]   Could they actually be increasing Apple's market share by creating confusion in the marketplace?
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.200]   I don't know how much confusion there really is just because people who are going to use
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.320]   Windows 7 or Windows 8 or always going to use Windows 7 or Windows 8.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.680]   Enterprise is still going to use Windows, and that's the biggest customer right now.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.400]   So I only see this as a plus for Microsoft.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.000]   Even if the tablets fail horribly, they've proven one thing, and that is that they can
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   create a message.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.920]   They can create a vision which has been absolutely lacking for the last couple of years.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   I mean, it's been going through the...
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   No, they got their mojo back.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.920]   They got their mojo back.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.920]   Yes, with this, they got their mojo back.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:19.200]   But for as great as Surface is looking, at least the RT side, in my opinion, they totally
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:27.080]   blew the marketing side, which is the product's name is Microsoft Surface 4 Windows RT.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.320]   What the hell is wrong with them?
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.640]   They actually went to all the trouble to create this really beautiful tablet, and then they
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.640]   name it that?
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   I mean, that is actually...
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   Surface is an okay tablet name.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   No, it's actually a fine tablet.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.280]   It suffers from the association of that big-ass table five years ago.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   Yes.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   I don't know if that really matters.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   I think only Geeks kind of...
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   Only Geeks.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   I mean, I agree with you.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   And I think it's a wonderful name for a tablet.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.720]   That has a nice feeling.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.800]   But they have this Windows RT, Windows 8.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   What are they?
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.720]   Yeah, all they had to do is they call the iPad competitor the Surface, and they call...
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:02.920]   If they have to do this stupid, half-baked tablet PC, slate PC thing, just call that
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.760]   the Windows Slate PC Pro, or whatever the hell you want to call it doesn't matter, because
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.000]   it's specifically aimed at the Pro market.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.240]   But just call it the Surface.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.240]   I mean, that...
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.600]   If there's confusion, they call it the resurface.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.640]   Yeah, if there's confusion, I think it's because they clearly do not know how to position
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.760]   this, and nobody knows that Windows RT is.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   No, I agree.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   I'm not sure it's heard of that.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.440]   It's a terrible name, and those who have are confusing it with WinRT, which is the real
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.440]   time kernel at the run in the runtime.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.440]   And so it's like...
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.440]   But Microsoft has...
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.440]   Oh, wait.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.440]   Even on the software side.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.280]   Remember, I remember with Steve Jothick, you're fun of Microsoft one year when he introduced
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.240]   a new Mac OS, and he said, you know, what comes in...
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.800]   He talked about the Pro version, the consumer version, and of course they were all the same
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.960]   price, they were all the same product.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.040]   Compared to Microsoft, it sometimes will have four or five different versions of Windows.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.080]   All theoretically aimed at different audiences, all with different prices.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:58.320]   And again, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference, and Apple has really thrived on
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.960]   just keeping it very, very simple.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.240]   Whether you're working in a corporation or at home, you have the same Mac OS.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:12.000]   I wish...but this is pure blue sky that there were some other operating system out there.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Why isn't there...
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Other than Android.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   I mean, there's Linux.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.440]   Android's a version of Linux.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.440]   There's Linux.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.440]   There's Windows.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.440]   There's Mac.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.440]   Oh, you're talking about on the desktop.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.480]   Yeah, like why isn't there somebody like Jean-Louis Gesei with BOS?
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.440]   Why isn't there somebody developing the next great operating system?
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.280]   You know, there'd be a huge opportunity here to go to the OEMs and say, "Hey, we've got
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   something for you.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.280]   Maybe make it compatible so it runs Windows."
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   It didn't work.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.280]   No?
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.280]   It's too late.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.760]   You need a patent portfolio to defend yourself.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   Oh, you're right.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.760]   You're going to create a new operating system.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.760]   You're right.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.760]   That's exactly right.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   You just can't do it.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.760]   It's sued out of existence.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.760]   It's software patents that do it.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.440]   One thing is for sure though, with cloud computing, the fact that whatever this new operating
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.520]   system is would not run thousands of programs is less important today than it was five or
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   ten years ago.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   That's true.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.320]   I mean, I am amazed how few programs I use.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.520]   The only program I just recently got a new MacBook Air.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.680]   The only program I actually had to load in from a disk and wasn't even a disk was Microsoft
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.680]   Office.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.680]   Everything else I downloaded.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.320]   And as far as I can recall, they were all free.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.240]   I don't remember paying for anything other than Office to fully equip my machine because
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:22.120]   90% of what I do, I do in a browser anyway, which of course is Google strategy.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.640]   So I think it actually could be possible.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   And you go to Chrome OS?
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   Is the Chrome OS?
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   No, no way.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.280]   That's where I'm going to do that one.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.000]   You know, that may be true, but I think part of the issue is there's a consumer perception
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.480]   now that you have to have a great app ecosystem.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.520]   And I think people know which platforms have the best app ecosystems in which don't.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.680]   And whether or not you're really into apps almost doesn't even matter.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.680]   I agree with you.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.320]   And that is going to be the crux for Windows RT.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.720]   It's got to have apps.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.880]   It means that Windows 8 developers have to push that button in studio and say make an
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.320]   Emetro app and they have to sell it in the Microsoft store.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   Will that happen?
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.800]   I mean, it's more than that, right?
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.040]   It's not just build for ARM processor and then it runs on the Microsoft store.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   Well, you can't actually.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.760]   You can do that if you make a Metro app on Windows 8.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.760]   Right.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.920]   So that's the question is is developers are developers going to develop for Windows RT?
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.320]   Are you going to see an app ecosystem?
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.840]   Because if not, it's dead, right?
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.000]   Are developers developing for Windows?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Windows RT.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.600]   No, no, are they developing for Windows?
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   Are they making Metro apps?
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.200]   Actually, the real question is are they?
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   Yes.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   But are they making Metro apps?
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   No.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   Not yet.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   Not yet.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.520]   The irony is that tablets require an app ecosystem more than laptops and desktops do
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.520]   today.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.520]   Absolutely.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.640]   There isn't a huge demand for desktop software, but there's an enormous demand for apps,
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   which is kind of-
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.640]   Because they're cheap.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:45.200]   That's again, this thing, this cheap software are free on expensive hardware.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.480]   That's the Apple model.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.840]   And Apple owns it.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.480]   That's my question is how can you succeed?
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.480]   Yeah, you've got Windows developers, but you've got to convince these Windows developers
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.800]   to make tablet apps.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.760]   I mean, right now, if you are a developer of any kind, you're going to be chasing the
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   money.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.320]   And the opportunity for software has completely unlocked in the last couple of years.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.960]   And I think a lot of that's due to Apple's strategy.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:10.880]   They've kind of reinvented software, at least in the consumer market.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.560]   And so if you're a developer out there, it's a huge opportunity for you to go to Android,
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.040]   iOS especially, and most of the big apps are launching iOS first now.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.760]   I don't really see what the motivation is to start on Windows.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.840]   And we've been burned already.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.800]   We maybe we made some Palm Priest software.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.200]   We made some Apple software.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.520]   Oh, that didn't work.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.680]   Maybe we made something for the Blackberry.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.120]   Oh, that didn't work.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   There's something we're leaving out.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.560]   And that is, yes, tablets have really driven an app mentality.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.760]   But there's something that's beyond that, and that's internet as a service.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.120]   And we're seeing that from more and more carriers, actually providing the heavy lifting
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.640]   remotely.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.120]   And tablets are a perfect portal into tapping into that.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:58.840]   Now, if you start looking at internet as a service as the next generation of applications,
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.640]   then no one really has a strong hold on that.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.400]   Maybe Amazon, but definitely not Apple.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.160]   Apple's done horribly with internet as a service.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.400]   When you say internet as a service.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.040]   So not just cloud storage from software as a service.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.280]   Why cloud sucks?
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.800]   I cloud sucks.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.160]   But I mean, in the enterprise, you actually start looking at hosting the services that
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.000]   you would normally require within the network remotely, getting it out of your colo, getting
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.240]   it out of your data closet.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.560]   And that, at least in the enterprise, we're moving more and more to that.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.120]   Some of the services that you never thought enterprises would be willing to part with,
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.120]   they're now fine with sourcing to a center.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120]   They have no idea where it is.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:45.360]   And that's the big rumor, of course, that at Google I/O, Google will announce its EC3.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.240]   It's cloud platform as Amazon has.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.480]   Microsoft has one, Azure.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.000]   Is that where the battleground is?
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   It could be.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.440]   And why develop an OS if all the heavy lifting is going to be done remotely?
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.440]   Right.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.160]   You're saying this becomes a thin client.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.440]   We're back to like the 1980s with the thin clients.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   Well, that's depressing.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.240]   Actually, we've got the 1970s.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   Well, that's right.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   That's right.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.240]   The remote terminal within many ways.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.920]   I really feel like it's the whole thing is back to the future.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.120]   What do we not know about surface and why?
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.000]   We don't know how much it's going to cost.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.400]   We don't know what the resolution is.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.680]   We don't know what it's available.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.000]   We don't know what the battery life is.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.120]   Well, they wouldn't let anybody touch it.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.880]   We have some kind of rough numbers on some of these.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.600]   No, it's 1080 on the P on the Windows 8.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.560]   So we know it's going to be available around the launch of Windows 8, which we know is
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.880]   going to be available later this year.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.080]   They said that they're going to have it priced competitively with other products similar
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   to it.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.200]   So we're expecting an iPad-esque $500 price point.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   Maybe you want to borrow any of the lots.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   Can they do that?
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.400]   Of course, I'll tell you the supply chain can make such a thing.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.600]   Yeah, I mean, some of those parts might not be as great as what you have in the iPad.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.840]   But they're Microsoft.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.600]   They can throw money at this problem.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.560]   If anyone can throw money at this problem, they can.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.080]   Because they're not in the razor thin margin business that all their hardware partners
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   are.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.120]   So this is part of the problem.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:15.400]   Did you read the piece about that Chrissy Glor wrote about Palm and how they went from
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.600]   being Palm to being dead in like 30 months or so?
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.760]   One of the interesting things that was brought up in that piece was they were basically picking
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.760]   up after Apple scraps in the components market.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.520]   So Apple go out, they would find and identify like the best product and say, oh, we really
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.800]   love the Sony camera sensor.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.320]   And they go by basically every single one that was produced.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.040]   And then every other company who wanted to use a sensor in their tablet, that sensor
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.040]   in their tablet was unable to.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.360]   So they have to go find some other crap your part to use.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.720]   And Microsoft could see that with a pre it broke at the drop.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   You'd look at it.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   It would break.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   I mean, the thing was terrible.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.560]   Microsoft has enough money to actually throw money at this problem.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.640]   So they could do the same thing.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.640]   Apple does.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.520]   Yeah, we don't know though.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.720]   We don't know how good the hardware is going to be.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.040]   It'll probably be good enough.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.640]   But we don't know what the price is going to be.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.440]   And there's a great article.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.360]   Danny Sullivan, who was one of the people who was down there.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.680]   And I know when we had Paul Therat and Mary Jo Folland went as weekly, they weren't there.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.520]   But they also complained that so many of these gadget blogs, I'm sure gadget didn't
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.880]   do this, but the verge to not to get.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.120]   They all said, our hands on, first hands on.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.080]   And that really was a little bit of a stretch.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.680]   For instance, Danny said, I tried to, I was able to hold one.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.400]   And then I pressed, I thought, what if I press and hold the desktop?
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.320]   Will I be able to see what the resolution is?
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   And they grabbed it from him as he started to do that.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.320]   And then he tried it again.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.880]   He said, nice try.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.920]   And they grabbed it again.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.120]   You could type on the keyboard, but not if it was attached.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.280]   And yet we've seen Windows 8 running on tablets.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.000]   The Samsung, it runs OK.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.560]   It runs, there's some crashes, but it's pretty good.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.240]   What's, why the secrecy?
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.240]   That means it's not ready.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.240]   It's just not done.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.240]   They can do three things.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.960]   I see three things done at these product demos.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.200]   Apple does two things.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.800]   They either let you play with the product.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.920]   And then when they do, they let you just go to town on it.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.520]   And then when the iPad was announced, three months before it was shipped, the first iPad,
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.000]   there was a hands-on room.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   So I was there.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   I got to play with them.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I was there at an Apple event.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And you could touch it.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   And you could use it.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Yep.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   So they either do that or they put it in a case and no one's allowed to touch with it.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.120]   But most of the time, Apple actually ships products a day.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   They announce them.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   Wow.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   Certainly a few days.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.120]   And especially when they do that, they let everybody play with it.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.240]   The iPad one, that was your third option.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.520]   The third option is this thing, which Palm has done and a number of companies have done,
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.640]   which is they bring out half-baked software.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.480]   They want to come off as though it's ready to go.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.040]   And that, oh, well, you know, we're like, we're really excited about this thing.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.360]   And it's just not there.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.600]   And so instead of putting it in a case and making it seem like it's not ready to go,
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.400]   they give you the illusion that you can actually play with.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   Classic.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.400]   And then it's ready to go.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:05.200]   The BlackBerry Playbook at CES 2011, where they had a video on the screen that looked
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200]   like it was doing something.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.320]   They wouldn't let anybody hold it, but they say, look, see?
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.360]   And it turned out it was a quick time movie running of the OS.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.280]   That's how far away from it.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.120]   Palm did this on a number of occasions.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   Palm did this at the touchpad launch, where you could go up and you could play with it.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:26.040]   They wouldn't actually let you hold the device, but you could put your finger on it.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:32.000]   And you could just go through like a very simple flow of like open a calendar app, but
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.360]   not actually do anything with it.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.760]   So I mean, you could have been basically opening a static image.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.240]   Was it a mistake to have this announcement then when they did, if it's really that far?
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.960]   I mean, aren't they expecting people like you to say, well, it's obviously not done.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.600]   It's, you know, it's hard to say.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:51.040]   I think that it's good that people have it on their radar.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.360]   I don't think that they had to do it because whatever Google announces at I/O is, you know,
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.400]   there's going to be a product roadmap lag there where it's going to take many months for
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.240]   all of their hardware partners to start adopting the newest version of the tablet.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.920]   So I mean, I don't know.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.400]   Maybe they felt like they had their back against the wall.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:14.280]   Maybe they felt like it had been, you know, three years and it was time to make the announcement.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.960]   Maybe they wanted to soften the blow to the partners.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.560]   And what's with announcing the press conference four days ahead of time and not telling people
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.080]   where it is until 10 o'clock that morning?
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.520]   I mean, I have never seen anything like that before from any company where you literally
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.560]   don't know where you're going until you land at LAX.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:37.360]   That was a hand-handed attempt to create Apple-like excitement around this event.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.480]   I mean, they did much better than Microsoft normally does with these events.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.560]   Even with all the things that we're lacking, it's still much better than what I expect
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.280]   from Microsoft press release.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.960]   And yet they still trotted out Balmer.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.960]   And yes, I know.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.440]   Well, I guess they have to.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   It wasn't Balmer.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.200]   Actually, Balmer looks good compared to Steven Sinofsky.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.000]   If you've watched the video, which I have, Sinofsky was nervous that crashed on him,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.240]   which completely threw him.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.960]   He misspoke a couple of times.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.160]   Now, I don't know if that's...
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.640]   I don't know, Sinofsky.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.200]   Maybe he's not good in front of crowds.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.600]   I think he's not.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.000]   But Balmer at least had some presence.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Nothing crashed.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.080]   That's one word for what Balmer has.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:20.520]   You know, at some point in the next month or two, we're going to hear something will
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.200]   leak out and we'll know what they were trying to preempt or we're going to find out what
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.920]   it is that they were afraid of and why they pushed when this wasn't obviously not ready
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.080]   to go.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.600]   But on the plus side, good things have happened for Microsoft.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   They have created a buzz about this product.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   Absolutely.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.200]   And like you mentioned, they got their mojo back on the campus in Redmond.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.680]   So these are all good things.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.280]   If there is one reason to do it, it's because you want people to write software for it when
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   it launches.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   That's the reason why Apple, despite its normal, you know, incredibly secret way of
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.480]   doing business, they announced their OS's way early.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.200]   You know, they announced iOS 6 and everything in iOS 6 and they put it beta in developers'
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:01.480]   hands months in advance before launch every single year because they want apps to run
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.320]   that thing when it launches to the public.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.560]   So there is if there's any reason to do it, it's that there's still that lag for some
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.720]   reason this retina display they've known developers have known this was coming and there's still
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.200]   a handful of retina apps and they're all from Apple.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:22.640]   And I mean, you know, with with with the surface for Windows RT, I got that right.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.880]   You know, it's not like they introduced the specific details or APIs or anything to take
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:28.880]   advantage of that.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.880]   But they got that.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.880]   And that's what they want to do.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   They want to do.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.400]   But if I'm a developer and I want to go out there and I want to build Metro apps for
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.800]   this product, I can't do it right now.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.840]   And that's a big difference between them and Apple.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:42.320]   If I if I'm in if I'm in a developer and I'm really stoked about what I just saw on iOS
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.480]   6, I can that day register for an account, start building my iOS 6 app.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   I'm not sure.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.840]   I think you can write.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.120]   You can start writing Metro apps for Windows 8 now.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.600]   But I'm saying is you can't target that hardware.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.600]   Right.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.960]   You know, there's no there's no other Windows RT products out there.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.280]   So I can't target the surface if I want to build something for that.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.000]   Yeah, you need you need at least screen resolution.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.320]   At least you need just some basic information.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.000]   So that was kind of a well, you know, I think we all are in agreement.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   A couple of things.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.120]   First of all, every tech pundit wants Microsoft to succeed because it's just much more interesting
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.880]   to cover a market where it's vibrant and there's competitors and there's something interesting.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.500]   I think that everybody also is kind of rooting for Microsoft because it's been a kind of
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.280]   dull company for a long time.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.360]   I think I'm not alone.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.520]   I think a lot of people thought Steve bomber was running the company into the ground.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:38.680]   So to see bomber come out and introduce something new and exciting and potentially great.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:43.720]   We don't know because we can't touch it is I think basically good.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.120]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.120]   I mean, I can't.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   I can't.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:54.160]   But for their vision and taking a chance, no question, they're taking a huge chance, right?
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.160]   They have the pockets.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.520]   Oh, each have the deep pockets.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.000]   I mean, that's why they did Xbox.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.400]   If I remember correctly is because Bill Gates said to his executive team, look, we've got
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.920]   like, you know, almost infinite amount of money.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.160]   Let's make a big bet on something like there are very few companies who can throw $5 billion
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   at a problem.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.880]   So let's go make a big bet and jailer said, okay, video game market.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.920]   Let's create a video game console.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.440]   And as CES keynote, bomber talked about betting the company.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.280]   He literally used to be betting the company.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.640]   He was talking about Metro and I'm not sure they're really betting the company.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.240]   I'm Metro, but I think that they're hedging on Metro.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.240]   Yeah, they're hedging on Metro.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.680]   But he's taking huge bets right now.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:35.200]   And I think he really has to because Microsoft, as he said, it's lost its Bojo.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.680]   I remember at all things digital.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.200]   I think it was a year ago, Eric Schmidt talked about the great PC companies and the great
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   companies.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.720]   And let me see if I can get them all right.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:48.400]   He mentioned, of course, Google, Amazon, Apple, I can't remember what the fourth one of the
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   five.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.960]   Yeah, that's the top one of them.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   Yeah, no.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.160]   And that is that was actually a fairly accurate portrayal of where they fit in the industry.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.800]   And they've got to do something bold.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.800]   Are they now?
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   I give them credit.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   One of the five.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.360]   Oh, they're probably number five, but they're just not just inching way up there.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.200]   Inching into the top five.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.800]   I think he put eBay up there with Amazon and Apple.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.800]   Was it was Google?
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.520]   It wasn't eBay, was it?
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.520]   Amazon, Google, Apple.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.520]   Oracle.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.520]   Chatter will tell us.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   No, you don't have to look it up.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   That's what we have.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   We've got the amazing Facebook.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   Oh, Facebook.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.520]   Of course.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   Facebook.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.520]   Absolutely.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.720]   And I wouldn't disagree with any of that.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.640]   Although there's reasons that Facebook might be in trouble.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.480]   We'll talk about that.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.840]   I do want to talk about Windows Phone 8.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.520]   There's some consternation there.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.520]   That.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.480]   What a week for Microsoft and for us.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   We've got a great panel.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.520]   Father Robert Ballester, Future Hope.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:53.480]   Future Hope is right of this week in Enterprise Tech, which debuts July 20 or so.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.480]   Couple of three weeks.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.480]   Can't wait.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   What's your first show on?
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   First show is all about deployment of wireless, the proper deployment of wireless, how you have
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.200]   to actually survey the site that you're going to be deploying your wireless in that will
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.000]   determine how many APs you need, how they have to be tuned, where channels have to be
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.920]   allocated.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.640]   It's something that a lot of people take for granted when you deploy wireless.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   Wait, it's a black card.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   It's a black card.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:26.640]   There's actually going to be an engineer from yours who will be going around with a spectrum analyzer.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.520]   I'm measuring here because we have a measure of everything in the studio and determine exactly
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.440]   where the array should be put and then tune the radios because sometimes you get better
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.280]   results when you bring down the power as opposed to most manufacturers which just want
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.280]   to jack everything up.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.600]   It's going to be a great show because it's going to be very case study focused.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.320]   It's going to be how you solve problems.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.600]   And one of our concerns with an enterprise show is we'd just be about enterprise technology
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.880]   and normal users wouldn't want to watch it.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.760]   But you're going to make this accessible for everybody and everybody will be learning.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.560]   We're all going to learn how to make your Wi-Fi sing.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.560]   Absolutely.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.560]   I can't wait.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   It's going to be fun.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.560]   That's later this month or next month, I should say, on the Twit Network.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.080]   Also from GDGT, the great Ryan Block.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.480]   I see Veronica.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   Hi Veronica.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   Congratulations.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.120]   Now that everybody's looking over there.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.800]   You've got the PQZ.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   I do.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.400]   You know, I can aim the camera.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.240]   Oh, Veronica didn't know about this when she showed up.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.840]   Okay, I've got him back.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.280]   Go back this way.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.800]   She's kind of in the dark.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.520]   Oh, there it is.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.520]   Now wait a minute.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.880]   This has 19X zoom.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.680]   I'm still learning how to use this.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:33.840]   We got this for another new show.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.160]   We're going to launch called Know How with IAS.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.160]   And oh, jeez.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.160]   What's wrong with the focus?
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   What?
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.560]   Isn't it?
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.560]   Shouldn't it be focusing?
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   I'm pressing auto focus.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.560]   There we go.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.560]   There's her top of her head.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.800]   She's wearing a lamp.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.920]   Show us the ring.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.720]   Show us the ring.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.720]   Ooh.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.720]   Good.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   Good man, Ryan Block.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.720]   Good man.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   Did she design that?
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   Thank you.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:10.600]   Before a studio audience of thousands.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   Did she do?
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.600]   No, no.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.760]   Was it a complete surprise?
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   Yes.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   It was.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   Smart Boy.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760]   He knew.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.600]   He knew she was a keeper.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.000]   I don't know about her.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   I'm shocked.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.200]   I'm shocked that she said yes.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   It was so cute, the picture.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.440]   And she said, I said yes.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.600]   It was so cute.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   I loved it.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.680]   Also with this Larry Magad, who is in his, his letter.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.280]   He's a player somewhere in San Francisco.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   From CBS Radio.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   How are you?
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   Oh, you're in Palo Alto.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.680]   No wonder you didn't want to come all the way up here.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.680]   I understand that.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   I love coming up there.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.680]   You know, down in Palo Alto.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:43.680]   Beautiful deck.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   We'll get your back.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.680]   I'll bring my dog on in the next segment, maybe.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.680]   That's one.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.680]   We got Ozzy.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.680]   Anything you want to plug Larry or anything?
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.800]   Well, you know, go to Larrytheworld.com and safekids.com.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:53:00.840]   A lot of stuff this week about internet safety or last week with that scout fiasco or bad
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.200]   things happens to teens.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.400]   And then a lot on there about under 13's on Facebook.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.880]   Why I think kids will be safer on Facebook if they allow under 13's on there.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.880]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.880]   So Larry's world and also safekids.com.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:13.880]   That's very interesting.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.880]   I want to hear what that.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.880]   I want to hear your rationale for that.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.880]   But not right now.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.160]   We're going to take a break.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:24.200]   But when we come later in the show, I'd like to know why would kids be safer on Facebook
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   than not?
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.440]   Because right now, technically, if you're under 13, you know, a lot of beyond that Facebook.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:33.400]   I'll show an infographic to the Facebook released on what happens when you complain about a
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.360]   post on Facebook.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.200]   Crazy, crazy.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.040]   But first, let's talk about stamps.com.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.720]   Now, this is crazy like a fox.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.160]   If you don't want to go to the post office and wait in the line to buy stamps, if you
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.640]   don't want to go to the post office for any package over the 13 ounces, if you want to
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.760]   save money and get your mailing done, if you want to bring the post office to you, then
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.920]   you want stamps.com.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.400]   It is such a great service.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.840]   I hope you've tried it by now.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:04.080]   But if not, I've got a special offer for you stamps.com.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:09.440]   The deal is you print real US postage, the instant you need it right from your computer
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   and your printer.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.680]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.920]   I don't know what Pitney Bose is going to do.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.360]   You don't need special ink.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.160]   You got what you already have works.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.400]   Mac or PC, you can print it right on the letter.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.080]   It's very for business and very professional looking.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:28.080]   You can buy sticky stamps if you want to have sticky stamps.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.640]   You can even fill out the forms for you.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.080]   If you're doing international mail, you don't have to go to the post office.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.200]   It was always a problem when I wanted to mail something internationally, whatever you
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.520]   was in France, what a pain.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.680]   But no, stamps.com does it all for you.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.080]   Then the mail carrier comes and gets it.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.680]   You literally do not have to get up from your desk.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.840]   He will walk over to you or she and take it from you.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:54.600]   If you're a heavy mailer, you can even do it completely free.
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:59.760]   If you're an Amazon or eBay seller, they take the fields right out of the website so you
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.760]   don't have to do any typing.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.760]   I just got it.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.760]   You got to try this.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   Here's the deal.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   You go to stamps.com.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:08.720]   You click the radio microphone at the, see right there?
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.560]   Don't do the special $80.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.360]   No, no, no.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.680]   Click that radio microphone.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.840]   This is clever.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:17.000]   Then use the offer code TWIT.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:23.680]   And then the $80 offer turns into a $110 offer, including the USB scale.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.840]   You pay shipping and handling for that.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.240]   It's about $5.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.080]   $55 in postage coupons.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.760]   You get to keep the scale forever, by the way.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.880]   You get a supplies kit and a four week trial of stamps.com.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.720]   This is a great deal.

[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.040]   $110.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.560]   No risk trial offer.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.560]   Stamps.com.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.560]   Somebody says not for normal people.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.520]   Of course it's for normal.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.520]   I'm normal.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.360]   It's great for small businesses.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.840]   Great for small businesses, I got to say.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:00.240]   And yes, they are using the picture of me from 1946 before the war.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.840]   I think that's on the screensaver set.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.360]   I don't know what that, I don't know where they even got that.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:09.320]   I think they chose it because the green in my shirt matches the, that's ridiculous.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.320]   I'm.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   It's accurate.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.320]   It can go ahead.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   Side by side.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:24.120]   Oh no, now Ryan, Key Rock in the chat room has said that when you and Veronica start
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   your new show, it should be called GD Zilla.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.320]   I don't get it.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:34.960]   Oh, like gadget and Texilla mixed together should be or could be tech cheat.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.960]   Gazilla.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:36.960]   Zilla.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.560]   You guys ever want to do a show together?
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.960]   We've talked about doing a show together.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.960]   Veronica's got like, she's, she's.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.680]   She has so many shows.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.480]   She can say she's very busy.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.320]   She couldn't fit me in.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.880]   We'll give you a plug, sword and laser with the Tom Merritt.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.880]   Fantastic.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.840]   She interviewed George RR Martin.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.000]   Oh my God.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.880]   The guy who wrote, you know, the Kingslayer stuff, the game of vice and thrones.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.280]   Was he cool?
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.440]   He had the hat and everything.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.560]   Little sailor hat.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.560]   Wow.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.560]   Suspend.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.560]   He has wears a big suspenders.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.880]   He's quite the, quite the interesting looking fellow.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:21.360]   Well, you got to find that on the Geek and Sundry channel at YouTube or go to swordandlaser.com.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.520]   You know, next time you got to be on the show, if you want to do the plugs, okay?
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.520]   I'm just saying.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.520]   Hey, while we're plugging stuff.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.520]   We got the tight shot though.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.840]   We got the tight shot there.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   She is.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.000]   Look at that on the point and the pan tilt zoom lean to your left.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   There you go.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.720]   No, she's hiding behind this with below.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.360]   This is our new camera.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.360]   This is so fun to play with.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.720]   Well, we're plugging stuff.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.480]   We have a huge event in New York on Monday.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.480]   How exciting.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:46.480]   Everyone's invited.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.480]   Come out.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   Where?
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.280]   In New York, it's at the Altman building.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.040]   But if you go to gt.com, it's on the top of the page.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.280]   Go to go to gadget.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.560]   It's we have a big promo out there.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.560]   These events are great.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.520]   If you've not been to a gadget event, go because you have how many vendors will be at
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.520]   this event.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.520]   Dozens.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   A lot of companies.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.160]   Chance if you want to see us three for instance before you buy it.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.520]   You want to touch it and steal it and handle it, which I recommend.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:11.080]   There's a lot of companies are not like Apple where you can actually talk to them about
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.920]   what they're doing and how they do it.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   They love to tell you.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.920]   They like to tell their story.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   I think these are great events.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.080]   You've done them before in New York.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   You've had them in San Francisco.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.040]   I see you've got Seattle, Boston and San Francisco.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.280]   Actually, if you scroll down the page a little bit, you can see some of the companies we
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   have there.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.680]   I mean, they're all amazing companies.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.520]   It's not a lot of companies.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.560]   Monster, Logitech, Nokia, Otterbox.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.520]   I love Otterbox's case.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.680]   It's sharp.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.360]   So you've got TVs.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.040]   Kowak, by the way, has a case for the note.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.840]   I was very happy to see the Galaxy Note.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.240]   Yeah, we give away free cases.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.240]   The first people of the case, they still have one.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.240]   I love that.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.240]   So that's right.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.240]   What's Twonky?
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.480]   They make a plug-in, right?
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.000]   Yeah, it's streaming.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.040]   It's media service.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.080]   Twonky.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:58.280]   You can install it on your, say, your Ready NAS, Netgear NASBox, and you can stream media,
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.000]   transcode media directly into your Xbox.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.160]   Cobra's going to be there.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.280]   Cobra has that great thing so you never lose your keys.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   I love that.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.720]   Or your phone.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.160]   If you leave your keys there, your phone beeps.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.000]   If you leave your phone there, the keys beep.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   For works, things.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Yeah, we've got a car.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   That's a first for us.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   We're actually bringing a car in.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Connects.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.080]   What's, can they make, what?
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   Adopters for your back book, a display.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.080]   Speaking of which, I know we're going to talk about Windows Phone 8.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.080]   Sugar Sync Tivo.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.080]   Look at this.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.080]   Holy cow.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.240]   Yeah, it's a big event for us.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   You want to get a C.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.240]   Buffalo.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Buffalo.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   Buffalo will have some on the PC.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.400]   I've been playing with the AC that,
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.400]   you know, it's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   It's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.400]   It's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.400]   It's a little bit more than a single one.

[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.400]   I think it's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.400]   I think it's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.400]   I think it's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.400]   I think it's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.400]   It's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.400]   I think it's a little bit more than a single one.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   I think it's a little bit more than a single one.

[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.400]   I think it's a little bit more than a single one.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.400]   I think it's a little bit more than a single one.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:05.400]   It's amazing.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.400]   It sounds like MHL is getting a little bit of footing.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.400]   The new Aunty A/V receiver I bought has an MHL port on the front.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   I thought, "What am I going to do with that? What else could I do?"
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   Your phone.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.400]   There's a special adapter, HDMI out.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.400]   It's a USB 6-H.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   It actually looks just like a standard USB adapter because MHL will
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.400]   use a USB MHL port on your receiver or your adapter or your TV.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   It charges and connects at the same time.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   Oh.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   I also have an iPod connector on the phone.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.400]   I have never used those things.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400]   Sometimes there's too much stuff to use at all.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.400]   Way too much.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   What do you carry for a phone now?
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.400]   For us.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   Still?
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   For us.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400]   Yes.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   I'm really looking forward to I/O because they usually give out new gear.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.400]   I'm really hoping for a phone this year because I haven't really played
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.400]   with Android as a daily phone for a very long time.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.400]   I'm actually very curious to kind of get back into it.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.400]   For us is still the gold standard.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.400]   There's no question the iPhone is a gold standard.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   But I have to--
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400]   The screen is so small.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.400]   This is 4.8 inches.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.400]   It's 1280 by 720.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.400]   I'm talking about the Galaxy S3.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:18.400]   It's kind of-- and look how good it's mind-blowing, the color, the richness, the density.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   What do you use, Larry?
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.400]   I'm still using the iPhone 4S.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400]   Where is it?
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.400]   There it is.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400]   And what about you, Robert?
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.400]   Are you iPhone guy?
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400]   You can't be.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400]   You must be a BlackBerry guy.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.400]   No, no.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.400]   I am using the Samsung Galaxy S2.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400]   S2?
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400]   S2.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.400]   Also very nice.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400]   Although I broke it.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400]   So I had to go back to a 4S for a while.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.400]   And I realized how much I missed the screen.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400]   That retina and the camera?
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.400]   Alright, we got to talk about Windows Phone.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   And then I want to talk about the retina because I am in love with my new laptop.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.400]   And everybody's bashing it.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   Oh, you bought the new one?
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.400]   I did.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.000]   I'm a sucker.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.400]   I bought it before I heard all the things like it's not repairable.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.840]   But you know what?
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.400]   I'm actually physically in love with it.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400]   Well, I wanted to--
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   Whoa!
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400]   I'm sorry, Kat.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.400]   Kat, the knitter from Let's Knit Together just hit her face.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.400]   She's embarrassed and I'm sorry.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.720]   So I went to the Apple Store the day after the announcement.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.560]   I looked at the Retina display and I loved it.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.440]   And then I decided to buy a 13-inch MacBook Air because I travel a lot.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.880]   And I want something as light as possible.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.600]   And last year, I carried her on an 11-inch.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:30.120]   So even the 13-inch is a half a pound heavier than I'm used to.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:35.920]   But it was a 4.5 pounds and Leo, the extra thousand bucks for the Retina display was
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.800]   a little bit of a dent for my wallet.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.160]   I completely understand the price.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.160]   I mean, that's crazy.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.160]   The company paid for it.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.160]   And wait.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.160]   Wait, it's not a problem for me.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.360]   I do-- and you know, I'm a big MacBook Air fan.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360]   I have my 13-inch Air.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.120]   I got a late model air and I love it.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.800]   But this is so thin and it's-- you know, what really happens is you kind of fall into the
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.000]   screen and then everything else looks like crap.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:06.680]   That's really-- so don't ever buy it ever, ever, ever until you're ready.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.760]   Because once you go Retina, you never go back.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.840]   I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   It's just stunning.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.560]   And I had to download all the wallpaper, change all my apps.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.160]   But boy, it's-- there's-- I'll tell you why it's different.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.760]   You know, you were talking about how the iPhone 4 great Retina display and the iPad Retina
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.480]   display, but they're smaller.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.640]   When you get a Retina display at 15 inches, there's something that happens.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.960]   It really does change things.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   And I cannot wait to see 4K TVs for that reason.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.680]   You know, I'm trying to-- the price is a big thing about this.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.720]   I'm trying to find what the original titanium powerbook they've got.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   It was more than that.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   I remember being horrible.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   I remember being horrible.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   But I don't remember what that price was.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:47.080]   And by the way, $2,199, you get 8 gigs of RAM, which is more than that.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.120]   I didn't need a 16 gigs of RAM.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.680]   And you get a 256 gig hard drive.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.680]   And people say, oh, how do you live with 256 gigs?
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.000]   How many gigs did the original titanium have?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.920]   Come on.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.240]   I remember when-- well, I'm an old-time--
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.800]   You have to add AppleCare, though.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.440]   I bought AppleCare because I can't fix anything.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.040]   Come on, Leo.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.760]   I remember when Toshiba laptops were $8,000.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.160]   I mean, and those were in 1980 something, $1.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.560]   So we've just come-- you know, there's a new economy.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.840]   We're just more accustomed to more affordable computers.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.920]   And by most standards, even the MacBook Air is expensive.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.800]   But people are willing to pay for Apple products.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.120]   And at least some people are willing to pay that extra $1,000
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.280]   for that very cool display.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.160]   I agree with you.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160]   It looked great.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.440]   One of the reasons I didn't buy it, because I knew once I owned it,
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.400]   I would never return it.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.480]   I'd have to hold onto it forever.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.840]   And I'm just not ready to treat myself quite that well.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.240]   But again, the extra pound and a half over the air, for me, makes a difference.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.560]   Because I go to trade shows, and I carry this thing on my back, sometimes
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.840]   for eight hours in a day.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.880]   And also no ethernet.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.320]   And that is--
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.200]   Yeah, I'm about to--
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.440]   Is that an issue?
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.800]   Well, they saw $30 Thunderbolt either in a gigabit adapter.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.800]   Yeah, I have it.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.720]   It will be an issue for--
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.560]   Business?
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.360]   Well, not business.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:57.880]   And government.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.520]   For IT people who use it for diagnostics.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.760]   But a lot of business brands don't have Wi-Fi, right?
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.320]   Right.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.280]   But the Thunderbolt adapter actually doesn't let you do some of the diagnostics
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.560]   that you use within a standard--
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560]   It's not the same.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.840]   It's not the same.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.680]   So you lose a little bit of the traffic, if you're trying to say,
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.240]   tap the traffic on a network.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:18.720]   But these--
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.120]   As a consumer, I--
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.920]   You can always go buy a regular 15-inch?
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.440]   That's from--
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:21.640]   So some--
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.440]   As a consumer, I have the ethernet adapter.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.480]   I think I've used it once in the year and a half that I've had it.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.680]   I can't remember the last time I've been to a hotel that didn't have Wi-Fi.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.180]   Right.
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:31.760]   Because I have it at home.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.800]   That's why I didn't mind it.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.160]   Because I have the adapter on my air, and I never--
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.240]   I rarely pull it out.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.920]   So that's exactly why I wasn't worried about it.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.000]   Optical drive I've gone, that's dead.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.400]   Yeah, I haven't used that in a long time.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.520]   I had the 13 inch 256 giga hard drive.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.640]   I still have 100 gigs free.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.160]   It was fine.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.560]   I wasn't worried about that.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:50.560]   The real question of my mind-- and this is one I don't want to hear the answer to--
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.920]   what PC makers are going to make retina--
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.360]   let's not use the word retina.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.120]   Super high res, quad res displays right.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:02.400]   Is in prezam some going to make a 9 or a 10 that's--
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.240]   It's a sooner or later.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:03.840]   So sooner or later.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.440]   And it'll be cheaper?
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.480]   Maybe.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:07.840]   The pen.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.080]   I mean, they could actually just build a much cheaper PC
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.960]   and then put a really nice high res display in it.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.960]   I mean, the thing with this--
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.960]   That made up what you want.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.960]   This is quad four.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.640]   Yeah, the thing with this laptop is Apple went-- they totally blew it out, right?
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.560]   They went, balls the wall on it, and they just made the best possible laptop they could.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.000]   And yeah, it's going to be really expensive.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   The titanium when it came out was $2,600 bucks.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.080]   Yeah, I'm seeing in the chat room like $25, $26.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.080]   That sounds about right to me.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.080]   And that was for inflation.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.400]   It might be like $27, $28, $28.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.200]   That was a G400 megahertz.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.240]   If you wanted 500 megahertz, $3,500.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.760]   Now that was $2,001 when a dollar was a dollar.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.600]   There are few inhibiting factors on the PC side because--
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.240]   Windows isn't going to handle it well, right?
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.600]   Well, no, Windows can actually handle very high resolution.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.480]   You can do a very high DPI.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:08:01.920]   But if you look at most systems today, they have either HDMI or DVI or even dual DVI.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.840]   They do not handle anything higher than about 1900 by 1200 very well.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.640]   So if you start outputting much larger than that, you need to move everyone over to display
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:18.560]   port or Thunderbolt, which you don't really have that much of on the PC side yet.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.120]   There's also some advantage Apple has because it controls the ecosystem a little bit better.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:26.600]   So Apple, for instance, the operating system is immediately HDPI DPI.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.120]   The browser is the upgraded most of their apps.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.320]   And I would say there's more unity in the app marketplace.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.080]   Well, it's a huge competitive advantage.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.280]   But it's going to be a long roll out for them.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.760]   Despite how quickly they may or may not be able to actually produce the panels on this.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   And I think--
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.800]   The panel production is why the weight is five weeks now on--
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.240]   It's hard to make them without a lot of dead pixels probably.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.200]   It's not only that, but yeah, I think it's just, you know, they're just ramping this
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.200]   up.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.200]   It's a brand new technology.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.200]   Nobody else is doing it.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.760]   They haven't hit scale for it yet.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.200]   But there are other technical issues they need to overcome as well.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:05.880]   I actually did a piece on gadget calculating what I expected.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:11.720]   Retina resolutions would be for basically the entire line of MacBook Pros, Airs, iMac,
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.600]   the Thunderbolt display.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:20.120]   And even if you just pixel doubled the Thunderbolt display and the 27 inch iMac, you're talking
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:25.600]   about more physical bits that need to cross over the wire than Thunderbolt can actually
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   support.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:33.440]   So just to do a retina version of the 27 inch iMac, the 27 inch Thunderbolt display, you
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.280]   have to have-- you basically have to have Thunderbolt 2.0.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.480]   So I'm screwed because I was waiting for a 27 inch retina.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.480]   I guess that's not--
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:47.960]   If you break it down, so it's like 5,000 pixels by 33,000 something like that pixels.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:55.400]   And then 24-bit, 60 Hertz, it's way more than Thunderbolt can handle.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.400]   Unfortunately.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.400]   How about SSDs?
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.520]   I mean, Apple's basically now all of its laptops now are SSD only.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.400]   Not the legacy, not the MacBook Pros.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.400]   Oh, they have hard drives?
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.320]   They still have hard drives.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.320]   But it looks like they're going a lot of way.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.320]   Definitely going that way.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:17.280]   In five years, maybe a little give or take, will all be on SSDs, thankfully.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   Enterprise.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.040]   Enterprise could go SSD.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.280]   Pretty much the only ones who are really holding out for rotating media are those who
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.040]   are doing any sort of extensive video editing.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:34.280]   That's the only application that requires a ton of space actually on the system.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.000]   And what you're seeing from those products is they're either going a hybrid route or
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.920]   they're going with dual drives.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.240]   You've got your SSD partition and then you've got your rotating partition.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.240]   I kind of like that.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240]   I do.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   I don't like the hybrids.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240]   They seem like their performance isn't great.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.640]   But I love having a boot drive that's a small SSD drive and then a massive spinning drive.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.640]   That's a good problem.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.120]   The thing with increasing storage though on SSD versus hard drives is it's actually
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.440]   a lot easier to double the storage on SSDs.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.720]   We know how physically to shrink dies and make memory smaller.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.480]   You actually have to come up with new scientific techniques to make hard drives double in
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.000]   space every couple of years.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.400]   And so every time they come out with like a new hack on the old medium, you know, Seagate
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.760]   and IBM, these other guys come up with these like crazy new ways to fit more bits on these
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.680]   spinning platters, that does not go on forever.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.680]   So you can actually just kind of keep reducing the memory size and don't want to capacity
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.720]   Larry and I are old enough to remember probably the days 15, 20 years ago.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.960]   And we said, there's no way hard drives can continue at this rate.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.240]   We'll all be using holographic cubes by the year 2000.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.960]   I remember the five megabyte hard drive and how cool that was.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:48.120]   On my desktop machine, I have a 250 gigabyte SSD and a terabyte hard drive.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120]   They worked very well together.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:54.760]   I keep my kind of deep data on the hard drive, my working data and my software on the SSD.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:02.040]   And I just ordered a terabyte, a Western digital terabyte, USB 3.0 drive for my MacBook Air.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.200]   It's going to be one of these ones.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.040]   It's small powered by the USB port.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.040]   I'm looking forward to that.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.680]   It's coming tomorrow, actually it's an eval unit that I'm testing, but I have a feeling
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.080]   I'm going to probably wind up buying it.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:20.080]   I bought a USB 3.0 USB stick and crucial makes a GT, which is the higher speed SSD.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.920]   And it's fast.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.840]   It's not, they say 220 megabytes, it's about 120 megabytes a second.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.680]   But that's still four or five times faster than anything out there.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:36.160]   But then I tested the hard drive in the retina and it blew me away because it's on the SATA,
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.280]   I guess it's 6 gigabit SATA 6.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.040]   Yeah, it's not in the controller.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040]   Unbelievable.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.920]   When you have like a really good controller on an SSD, that actually unlocks a lot more
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.400]   speed than you get on just the memory and so on.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.080]   Question for you, Ryan, though, we've been seeing performance drop offs as more and more
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.360]   drives have to move to MLC SSDs.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.480]   That's the cheaper form of flight.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.720]   Yeah, there's two kinds of MLCs.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.560]   But you've got a density problem dealing with SLCs.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:08.480]   So when are we going to start seeing reasonably priced SLCs in the 500 gigabyte range?
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.920]   You know, I can't really speak to the kind of component level aspect of this as much
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.840]   in terms of like long-term pricing.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.840]   But I did just read something that said, you know, basically all of the SSD memory on the
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.040]   market has plummeted in price over the last 12 to 18 months.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.560]   It's like half what it used to be and it's going to just keep going.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.280]   We've seen the prices of SSDs.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.800]   Yeah, and then, you know, because of the floods in Thailand last year and all of our
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.280]   production problems on hard drives, it's just it's a lot more clear now than it was even
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.800]   a year or two ago that this move is happening, you know, and it's just beating up.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:50.240]   Well, you could buy a 500 gigabyte MLC SSD right now for 340 bucks, I think.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.640]   I won't say who the vendor is because I don't want to give them a plug.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.840]   But when I saw that, that sort of blew me away.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.200]   I mean, I remember how big 500 gigs for $340?
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.800]   There's nothing wrong with MLC.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.280]   I mean, it's completely adequate.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.280]   Absolutely.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.280]   Much of what you get is MLC.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.680]   Especially if you're buying larger quantities at smaller prices.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.320]   Can I get that thing a new egg?
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.800]   That's what that's where it is.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.280]   You can say brands when I go about a cure.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.280]   That's amazing.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.440]   I just remember when I dropped my laptop and I had an SSD and once I saw the case and
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:26.560]   the screen wasn't broken, I relaxed because I didn't have to worry about the hard drive
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:30.640]   breaking, which is a huge risk with physical hard drives.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.000]   So just the safety of security.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.120]   Make no mistake, there will be a day where physical spinning platter discs will no longer
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.360]   be sold anymore.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.000]   It's coming, it'll be a few more years, I think, before the majority of products don't
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   have it.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.440]   But we will all look back on our spinning hard drives and our computers and say, "Ha, ha,
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.440]   ha."
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.840]   The same way we look back on massive room size 5 megabyte hard drives.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.040]   We're going to say the same thing about spinning platters.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.040]   It just doesn't make any sense.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.040]   Remember those days?
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:04.160]   Alan Malvatano, who's my own personal SSD guru, he writes for PCPer.com and has a really
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.520]   good chart of what controllers and what's the state of the art and SSD says that they're
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:17.240]   using in the retina, they're using the Samsung 830 controller, or I guess hard drive, SSD
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.240]   drive.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.960]   Is that a San Force controller?
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.440]   San Force chips that on that Allen?
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.560]   And it is a 6 gigabit SATA 6, which is pretty amazing speed.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.960]   I don't have the benchmark in front of me.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.800]   It's on the retina, but boy, I was blown away.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   I like an in tech for that stuff too.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800]   You do a lot of things.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.680]   And then Anand did a great review of the retina.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.840]   If you want to read it really concrete, we benchmarked it review.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.840]   They're so good at those.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.760]   Yeah, they're super good at it.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.200]   Okay, let's do phones.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.440]   We'll do phones in a bit because there's two things to talk about.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.720]   Of course, Windows Phone 8, not a lot to say about it, but we'll talk about it.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:58.880]   I think the big upset for a lot of people is that none of the Windows phones, Windows
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.240]   Phone 7s on the market today will get Windows Phone 8.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.880]   They'll get 7.8.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:09.000]   And the surprise was it's the Windows NT kernel on a phone.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   And what does that mean?
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.400]   We'll talk with our panel about that.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.960]   Also coming up, a big shock.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.400]   I believe it's true, but I wonder what Ryan's heard with a new iPhone connector.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.000]   Oh boy.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   It's not news.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.880]   In my opinion, we'll find out.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.040]   But first a word from freshbooks.com.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.880]   The easy online invoicing app.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.080]   I found fresh books.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.960]   Actually, Amber McArthur told me about it when I was one day back in 2004 complaining
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:39.960]   about invoicing.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.200]   See, I was working in Canada at the time and I had to do my own invoices and I had to do
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.920]   them in Canadian dollars as well as American dollars.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.200]   And come the end of the month, it was just a nightmare.
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.080]   It was like having to do taxes every month.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.520]   I just hated it.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.920]   She said, oh no, you got to try fresh books.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:56.920]   And I did.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.920]   And I fell in love.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.520]   And since then, 3.5 million other people have started using fresh books to do their
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.520]   online invoicing.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.520]   It saves you time.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.520]   It gets you paid.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.760]   I say 3.5 million, 4.5 million.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.680]   And number's going up.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.120]   Gets you paid faster because clients can view the invoice online and pay you right on
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.240]   the spot with a credit card.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.160]   And believe me, my experience was clients want to pay you.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.760]   It's just as much of a pain in the butt to go through their accounts as it is for you
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.760]   to do the invoices.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.600]   So make it easy for them.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.520]   Do you bill for hours?
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520]   Very cool.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.600]   They've got an iPhone app that will let you take hours.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.760]   Also a web app and the hours go instantly.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.040]   The time sheets go instantly into the invoices.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.520]   You can also run all sorts of great reports.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.200]   If you're talking about taxes, your accountant will love you at tax time.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.640]   It's already done.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.400]   Automated late payment reminders.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:52.200]   And yeah, they'll even print stamp and mail invoices for those old fashioned clients who
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.080]   like paper invoices.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.080]   You got to try it.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.080]   Here's the deal.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.840]   Go to freshbooks.com and you can try it free for 30 days and you get everything.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:06.160]   Unlimited clients, unlimited staff, all the features, no limits for 30 days, freshbooks.com.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.080]   I think at some point they say, "Where'd you hear about?
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.080]   Just say to it."
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.080]   That's all.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.600]   Just do me a favor.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.360]   Join the 4.5 million.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.360]   That number just went up.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.360]   It was 3.5 million.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.040]   4.5 million people who've been using freshbooks to do their invoices.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.880]   You'll see why it changed my life.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.800]   Let it change yours too.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.800]   Freshbooks.com.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:30.880]   Agility, 2.5 inch mid-range performance.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.600]   120 gig for $85.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600]   That's the OCZ.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.440]   I think the OCZ is pretty good.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.440]   Wow.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:46.520]   It's 525 megabyte per second read.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.720]   I really need to upgrade.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.680]   I'm still running on a really old 80 gig Intel SSD.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.680]   It's so painful.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.480]   But those were very good at the time.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.480]   They were very good.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.520]   It's still actually very good.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.000]   But capacity.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.600]   Yeah, the capacity is not very good.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   It kills you.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.600]   Not at all.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.600]   You have to make those decisions pan.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.320]   So let's talk Apollo.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.600]   I don't know what Microsoft.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.520]   It must have been just a crazy week for Microsoft.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:16.400]   So they do the announcement on Monday of the new Surface stuff.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.120]   Thursday they had already had a scheduled announcement for the new Windows phone.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.120]   I'm sure you went to that.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.280]   Yeah, that was in San Francisco.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.280]   So I went over to that.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.640]   That was at the Windows Phone Summit.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.640]   Right.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.280]   So tell what was your reaction?
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.440]   What do you think?
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.560]   I think they're working on some really, really interesting stuff with it.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:37.800]   I don't think there's anything that's going to blow the doors off.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.720]   But some really, really great incremental improvements.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.680]   One of the things that I thought was actually really interesting and not one of the more
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:49.440]   lauded announcements was they already have an answer to Apple's Passbook.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.920]   I think that's what it's called Passbook.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   Yeah, they mean the wallet.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.920]   The built-in wallet.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920]   Yeah, it's basically a wallet.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:58.040]   But to call it wallets, I think maybe kind of reductive because it also includes like train
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:03.320]   tickets and deals and you can scan the pay stuff and coupons and all that stuff.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.160]   So they're going to have that Windows Phone A.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.160]   Yep.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.760]   No, actually they're going to release that beforehand.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.280]   Those are, they have a couple of apps.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.400]   I think they're going to ship earlier than Windows Phone A.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:15.040]   So I don't think that they're going to release that beforehand because from what they, how
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.920]   they describe it, it requires a secure sim to work.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:21.080]   That's how they, that's how their security model on that works, which I think is kind
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.520]   of a not a very smart way to go about that.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.720]   But I think that they're doing that so they can actually offload some carrier control on
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.720]   it.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:33.320]   But yeah, either way, it's still I think kind of an interesting play for them.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.760]   Their big thing though was the new user interface for the home screen.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760]   Right.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.840]   Which you kind of get on Windows Phone 7.8 people who bought.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:44.000]   I think the people who feel the worst are the ones who just bought Lumia 900s.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.160]   Actually, we, we put the Lumia 900 on our must-have list, which is kind of like our top three
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.920]   recommended products of every kind of product.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:57.880]   And we debated for weeks about the Lumia and we actually gave it the number three spot.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.480]   And it was actually big to do.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.360]   Microsoft made a real big deal about that.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.120]   And then when we find out about the fact that Windows Phone 8 is not going to be compatible
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.680]   with any of the current models, we took it off.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.680]   We took it off our list.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.160]   We no longer recommend that you buy the-
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.160]   Really?
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   It's still a good phone.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.520]   I mean, we didn't reduce its score, but we actually, and that was also right around
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.760]   the same time that the new Samsung came out.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   So we promoted the Samsung and we took-
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:25.760]   We replaced it.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.760]   We took the Lumia 900 off.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:33.280]   So you have a, actually I would agree 100% the iPhone 4S, the HTC One X and the Galaxy
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.280]   S3.
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.280]   Those are the three.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.280]   They're very tight.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:40.480]   Now, I do think that there's going to be room for a Windows Phone 8 phone later this
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.920]   year, but the 900 is not it right now.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:46.960]   Just a new screen though doesn't seem like enough of a big deal.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.040]   It's going to have the NT kernel.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.480]   What does that mean?
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.480]   I don't know.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.480]   What does that mean?
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.160]   I mean, I know, but like they didn't really do a very good job of explaining who cares.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160]   It's a unified platform.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.200]   What's it about though, right?
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.600]   So Windows, Windows RT.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:06.840]   So with the unified kernel, you're getting closer to the promise of right once compile
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.360]   many times.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.120]   So technically, as long as you've got all the settings right for display size, you should
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:18.320]   be able to cross compile across for Windows 8 Metro on the desktop for the Windows Phone
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.720]   F for the Xbox and for the tablets.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:21.720]   Oh, even the Xbox?
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:24.000]   Well, I don't know about that.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.480]   And they actually, that's not entirely, I mean, maybe that's what they're working towards,
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.960]   but that's not where they're at with the share.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   Absolutely.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.960]   Not there yet.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.040]   Because they definitely did talk about, okay, we made it so much easier for developers
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:41.880]   to port to Windows Phone or to port to Metro from Windows Phone because of this new shared
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.200]   core kernel architecture.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200]   But it's not there.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.440]   And it's definitely not a point where you just tick the boxes that you want to build
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440]   for.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   Right.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.640]   The real question I wonder from a consumer standpoint is how important is it that they're
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.360]   going to be putting the Metro interface on everything they do?
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.520]   Is that really going to become something that consumers are going to look for and expect
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:04.880]   and feel good about having a relatively common user interface among all their Microsoft
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.880]   devices?
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.480]   Well, what was it that you said that Ballmer said they're all in, they're betting the
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.480]   farm?
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.480]   They're all in.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.480]   That's how you're all in.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.200]   You're saying we believe so much in this very, you know, it's interesting because it's
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.400]   so opposite Apple with the skeuomorphic, you know, stitching and leather applications.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.960]   This is, there's not a, there's no, there's not a rounded corner in the bunch.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.960]   There's not a shadow.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.720]   It's a box.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.120]   And it's going to be everywhere.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.400]   And I think that this is Microsoft saying the problem is that these things are really
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.400]   about style and they're about fads and they're about fashion.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.640]   This isn't functionality.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.480]   We're talking as a fashion.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.480]   Do we really care?
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:44.760]   I mean, at that important, at our phone and our tablet and our laptop all have the same
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.200]   Metro interface.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:52.000]   I for one can live with slightly different interfaces with different types of devices.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.680]   But for some reason, Microsoft seems to think it's a really big deal.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.280]   But you make the form follow the function.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.160]   We don't care, but developers will care.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.760]   And that's what they need for developers.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.160]   That's for developers.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.840]   It's that one click that checkbox across the board.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.800]   Which well, Microsoft needs that because they need apps on the Windows phone and they need
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.440]   and more importantly on Windows RT, they really need apps.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.440]   They've got Nate, but what it also means, I mean, but is Metro enough for business?
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.440]   I mean, isn't it?
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.440]   Isn't it?
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.880]   It's a interrupt means that it doesn't use a desktop or it can use a desktop.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.160]   Those don't use the desktop.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.320]   It doesn't use a desktop.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.560]   So it's just slighties.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.440]   I have to think that in three years that interface is going to look as old as an Edsel.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.240]   Well, I mean, the iOS interface to me looks.
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.240]   It's dated.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.240]   It's dated.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.320]   When you compare that to Android and widgets and live desktops and so forth, it's just
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.360]   a array of icons.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.560]   That's pretty dated.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.960]   You can't have fish swimming through your iPhone.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.440]   It's not that the array of icons doesn't work.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.440]   It clearly works.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.560]   It just-- I got to feed my fish.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.840]   We know that we want more.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.840]   Sorry.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.720]   If you don't feed them, do they start to get-- No, but that would be cool if they like
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.720]   died at the start of the phone.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:11.520]   They should scale it to the top of the phone.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.720]   Yeah, they go to the top of the seat.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.880]   The food comes down from the top there.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.240]   There it goes.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.240]   Come on.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.640]   Come on, fishies.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.360]   I'm sorry, I completely derailing the show here.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360]   Continue on.
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.360]   There they go.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.440]   One of the other things I showed was NFC, which--
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.440]   I like it.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   That's something that within--
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.440]   That's in this phone.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.040]   I think the nerdy community, people are really stoked about you doing this.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.760]   When you come into the brick house, how many of you-- nobody.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.200]   When you come into the brick house, you can tap your phone.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.960]   We have a textile, one of the Samsung textiles, that will check you into four square when
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960]   you come in and you just all like that.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.960]   How many of you did that?
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.960]   How many of you did that?
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.960]   Show of hands.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:45.960]   Chad, you don't count.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   Oh.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.960]   Oh.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.680]   I didn't even do it.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.680]   I forgot.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.240]   That's an interesting part of this S3 announcement that was US only.
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:01.160]   The S3 is one of a handful of phones that have-- and the NFC is in the battery, which
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.000]   is smart because Samsung is now saying you can't buy a third party battery.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   You got to buy a Samsung.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000]   Well, smart for them.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   Yeah, smart for them.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   Not for us.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.360]   I always buy a third party battery.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.720]   And for a very high price, I think it's $5 per sticker.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.880]   It's $15 for a pack of-- $3 sticker, $15 for a pack of $5.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.520]   You can buy these very interesting.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.440]   They have circuitry on the back.
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.440]   Little stickers.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.440]   And you put them on things.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.400]   So you put it on your dashboard in a car and you tap it.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.920]   The phone goes bloop and it turns on Bluetooth.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.720]   Or you could do a four square check-in.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:37.760]   Or there's a variety of things you can do with the software.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.960]   You have to be running the Samsung textile software.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.720]   And I get this-- I don't know if it's proprietary or if this is like-- this is going to be generic
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720]   NFC.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.040]   And you could use it with a Windows phone.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.920]   Well, so on Windows Phone 8, NFC is kind of built into the Core OS.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.480]   So it's a little bit different, I think, from what you're seeing on Mac.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   This is a bag hung off the sides.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.480]   Right, exactly.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.720]   So they want that to be kind of a core experience.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.720]   And I think we'll probably see that from Apple sooner or later.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.720]   Well, that's the question.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.720]   They're going to have to get there.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.800]   Can NFC succeed if Apple doesn't jump on the bandwagon?
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.800]   I don't know.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:09.800]   It's hard to say.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.600]   I mean, not with Windows Phone 8 right now, right?
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.400]   I mean, we know what their market share is.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.040]   It's not-- despite it being a pretty interesting product, it's not enough to drive NFC as a
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.040]   successful technology.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.760]   And there's only a couple of phones that support it on Android.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.360]   But the thing is if Apple does it and it's not any kind of open standard, we don't have
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:33.160]   any kind of cross-platform NFC standardization in terms of getting my iPhone to communicate
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:39.360]   with your Windows Phone 8 phone, then I think there's a huge missed opportunity there.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:45.840]   But I tell you, if there were NFC standard just for 4-square, that every place you go
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:50.400]   have a little thing that you tap it and it checks into 4-square.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400]   That's good for 4-square.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.400]   It would be very interesting.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.120]   It would promote NFC.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.120]   It needs to be cross-platform.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.920]   I presume that there's a standard.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.000]   Well, NFC is itself a standard.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   Right.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.360]   So that tech tile should work on anything that's an NFC.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   Theoretically.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.920]   But if I want to do something like if I want to use my iPhone to connect to your Windows
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:17.080]   Phone 8 phone and NFC is just the mechanism that syncs that up, that is not necessarily
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.080]   standard.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:22.400]   I can see, now somebody in the chatroom pointed out that Apple apparently does have a patent
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.880]   for NFC for the iPhone.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   That doesn't matter though.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:25.880]   They do that.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.880]   Yeah, you patent everything.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.720]   Patent does not mean that they're going to build anything.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:34.800]   I could see Microsoft, I mean Apple being petulant and saying, "That's fine."
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.480]   Go ahead, have fun with your NFC kids.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.640]   We'll use something else.
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.520]   I totally could see them doing that.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.560]   I mean, NFC will become popular when all the major financial institutions get behind
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.560]   it.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:51.600]   Because across the world that has been the only real successful use case for NFC.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.200]   That's why Nokia built NFC into their phones way, way back.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.200]   Right.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.200]   Oh really?
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.200]   It's been there.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.200]   NFC is just a communication standard.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.320]   It's a way to get identifying information from a relatively inexpensive sense.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.320]   It stands for Near Field Communication.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.080]   It's like RFID almost.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.640]   But the problem is, I mean, we actually, a lot of US financial institutions have adopted
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.040]   NFC in some form or another.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:18.120]   You've got Google Wallet with MX and VSense, stuff like that.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.640]   They're all looking at it, but they're all doing it in different ways.
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.800]   MasterCard has their pay pass or whatever they call it.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.040]   None of it's compatible with each other.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.760]   Everybody wants to do it their own way.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.800]   I think it takes an Apple to come in and be like, "No, look, everybody's going to do
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:33.280]   it this way and you may not like it, but at least we're going to be in one way."
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:39.080]   And I think that people haven't really figured out the huge benefit for, yeah.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:42.000]   I mean, I don't think it's that compelling a use case.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.240]   I mean, there are terminals and various merchants.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.720]   I can't remember the big national ones.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.720]   McDonald's has a pay pass.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:49.720]   I think, yeah, McDonald's.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:52.480]   I wonder what percentage of McDonald's customers are actually using it.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.480]   Almost.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.480]   Almost.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.480]   None.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.480]   It's so small.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.960]   And aren't people a little nervous about the security idea that they might get charged?
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:06.040]   Yeah, but I went to Japan a few years ago and I didn't quite fully understand it until
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.000]   it's completely ubiquitous.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.680]   And once it's completely ubiquitous, as well as everywhere, then it actually becomes completely
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.680]   essential.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680]   Sure.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:19.720]   You use the same mechanism to get on the train, buy lunch, get back on the train later in
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:25.040]   the day from some other kind of train, open your door at home.
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.440]   It does everything.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:30.640]   And until it does everything, until it's completely ubiquitous and standardized, it's
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.120]   just ghettoized.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.560]   But and I'm sure that the phone manufacturers are not insensible to this.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.400]   It makes this thing the most important thing in your pocket.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.000]   The phone suddenly is your wallet.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   It's everything.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.960]   It's really in their best interest to do this.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.440]   So that's why Apple should do it.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.440]   Well, I think they will.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.240]   One of the considerations is you have to build the hooks for NFC into the OS.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.080]   In other words, it's not going to work if you have to start up your financial app in
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:02.280]   order to pay for something and start up your ID app in order to open a door.
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:06.800]   So all of that functionality has to be built into the OS where it's always running in
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.080]   the background.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:11.240]   And now you could do that in Android by hacking it.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.160]   I mean, that's how I have it on my Galaxy S2.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.880]   It's actually a hack.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.440]   Whether or not Apple wants to build it in the iOS, I mean, they're not known for wanting
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.440]   to include a lot of overhead.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.920]   And then what are they going to do with the energy issue?
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.920]   The reason the battery you have yet another reason.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.520]   Oh, I can't imagine it uses.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.200]   No, it uses almost no power.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.680]   But the reason we're talking about this is because, to your point, about building it
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.480]   into the stack, that's what Microsoft did.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.760]   They built NFC into the stack.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.720]   That's a key component of Windows Phone Aid for them.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.600]   So that's in the background.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:43.280]   It's running all the time.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.720]   You know, I think this is a really compelling technology.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.480]   And it's clear there's money to be made.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.560]   But I think that you kind of have to get Apple because Apple is such a big part of
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:32:00.200]   the universe that merchants and credit cards, you know, in everywhere but the US, smart
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.200]   cards are everywhere.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.800]   A chip in the card, right?
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.880]   I mean, this is not a new idea.
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.280]   This never penetrated in the US.
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.400]   I'm not sure why.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.400]   We didn't want it or something.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.240]   I think people were probably nervous about the whole thing.
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.280]   Any other stuff in Windows Phone Aid that seems...
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.720]   Well, we should mention that 7.8, which is going to be available on existing Windows
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:28.240]   phones down to the Galaxy or at the Samsung Focus S, will merely give you the gutter,
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:32.040]   you know, the new Windows, the new Windows, start Windows.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.040]   But they are released.
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.320]   They've already released a couple of the apps.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.600]   There's going to be the new Nokia Maps not being maps, right?
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.680]   So that's interesting.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:45.760]   It's like, I guess Microsoft says Nokia Maps are better than our own product.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.960]   Makes you wonder, do you think Microsoft will buy Nokia?
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:53.200]   Well, I mean, it was in the register, so you have to take it for a grain of salt.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:57.400]   But they didn't post something about this a few days ago saying that Microsoft kind of
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:00.400]   looked at the books and they ran away screaming in horror.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:03.200]   If they bought Nokia, it would be a charitable donation.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.200]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:08.040]   Well, but they're very much going down, so it gets cheaper and cheaper every moment.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.040]   They don't need it.
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.040]   They don't need it.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.120]   They might buy it for maps.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.880]   If it's cheap enough, you might buy it for some individuals.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:15.880]   They didn't have to.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:19.760]   They could have spent $70 billion or whatever it was to buy Nokia a couple of years ago,
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:25.600]   or they paid $1 billion to Nokia to get them to license Windows Phone exclusively and become
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.400]   basically the premier Windows Phone partner.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.880]   So why buy the cow and you get them up for free?
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.800]   We did talk about this on Windows Weekly.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:38.000]   I think one of the points is probably Paul Therat, maybe it was Mary Jofoli, made about
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.280]   this is that nowadays, manufacturers are different.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.240]   You don't need manufacturing capability because everybody makes this.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:46.000]   It's all made in China anyway.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.520]   You need design.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.080]   You need engineering.
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.320]   But you don't buy Monokia because they make phones because you can do that.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.960]   You don't need, that's what Foxconn's for.
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:00.240]   Well, it's harder to design a phone than, you know, people might give a credit.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.960]   It's very difficult to build a cell phone.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.960]   The manufacturer could find it the actual assembly.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.360]   So there's a huge amount of expertise there.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.960]   I mean, that's why Facebook doesn't have a phone yet for, you know, among them.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.040]   Are they still working on that?
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.880]   There's a lot of rumblings right now that they're hiring like crazy from the Apple
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880]   mobile.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:18.880]   That's just crazy.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:19.880]   Why bother?
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:20.880]   We'll see.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:21.880]   So wait, there were two other things with that.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   So the maps.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   The compatibility.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.880]   That was a big issue.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:25.880]   And then the Siri competitor.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:26.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.880]   Tell me.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.880]   Right.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.880]   Yes.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.400]   The tell me acquisition is now kind of, I mean, the funny thing about that was they show, they
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.960]   demoed a Siri-like system and I'm like, okay, this is going to be interesting.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.400]   You know, God, somebody else is kind of really getting into this.
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:42.920]   And then when the voice came on, it sounded so much like Siri that I thought that they
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.240]   were, they were just punking everybody.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.600]   I thought it was going to be like a big joke.
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.760]   But that's actually the voice.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.280]   I mean, it really, they just copied the Siri voice.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.280]   Wow.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.800]   You know, one thing I find interesting about the Microsoft implementation is that I understand,
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.520]   as I understand it, there is going to be API so that the voice can talk directly to third
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.520]   party apps.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.840]   So one of the things that frustrates me with my iPhone is that, for example, on the map
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:08.880]   side, Siri is linked to Google Maps, which is their current mapping program.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.360]   Obviously, it'll go to the Apple Maps.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.000]   But I happen to use telinav maps, which are really, in my opinion, a better mapping program.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000]   Why can't Siri take me to that app?
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.080]   Why does it have to just work for Apple apps?
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:22.080]   Apple.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.360]   And by the way, Apple is using telinav maps.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.160]   But the telinav app doesn't have to respond to Siri.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.160]   Sure.
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.960]   Because the telinav app does have voice recognition, but Siri can't talk to it.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.560]   I think a lot of people are expecting that Siri will eventually start to be able to talk
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:38.560]   to other things.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:44.520]   And the Siri functionality in iOS 6 has been expanding in the new version, but it's not
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:45.520]   there yet.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:49.800]   I think that's what Microsoft thought that they could put a stake in the ground on, is
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.920]   having their voice application be able to talk more stuff.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.320]   Is the Siri voice from nuance or AT&T?
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.920]   They're saying in the chatroom it's a nuance voice and that, in fact, tell me had it before
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.920]   Siri.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.720]   So really, Apple stole it from Telme.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.720]   Nice.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.720]   Hey, it's a nice one.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:06.360]   Well, I mean, Siri was around long before Apple.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.360]   Right.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.160]   Yeah, Siri was a third party Apple bought.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.160]   Then so the incompatibility?
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:16.240]   Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of angry people.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:22.160]   But on the other hand, people are kind of used to buying a phone and just having it
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.160]   be what it is.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   Right?
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   I mean, if you've ever bought--
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.600]   If you've ever bought an Android phone, you know, you've got maybe like one, two versions
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.600]   if you're real lucky.
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:34.000]   Even Apple's not going to upgrade all of the iPhones.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.640]   No, they do this all the time.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:41.280]   I think the thing that's different about Windows Phone 8 not being compatible with basically
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:43.440]   any phones in the market right now is they said that.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.560]   They said straight out, it's not like you buy the latest, greatest, highest end phone
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.520]   right now we will guarantee you know, one, these one or two models will be upgradeable.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.520]   Right.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:53.520]   There's zero upgrade path.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:54.520]   Right.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.800]   So that basically means like if you're following Windows Phone at all, you're not going to
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.960]   want to buy anything Windows Phone related until the end of the year.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.640]   It kills the market from now.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.640]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.640]   It's all sports.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.640]   It's all sports.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:08.560]   It's essentially alienating the entire Windows Phone user base right now.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.560]   Which is my minutes.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.720]   There are going to be tens of people who are just going to take off.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.720]   It's harsh.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.720]   That's so harsh.
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:19.800]   There's something that reposters saying, no, you get a Google experience phone, you can
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:20.800]   upgrade it.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.800]   No.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.800]   If you have a next one.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.800]   Yeah, tell them to the next is one.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.800]   You have a next is one.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800]   You ain't going to jelly bean baby.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:29.040]   Or you know, I don't want to hear about like hacking your ROMs and stuff because that
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.480]   so does not count.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.920]   What are we going to see at Google I/O?
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.120]   Are they going to put glasses under the seat?
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.000]   I don't think so.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   No.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.440]   You'll get a phone and a tablet, right?
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:42.480]   And there will be a next is tablet, a Google branded tablet.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.960]   That's probably what they're going to give to people.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.680]   I'm guessing that that's what folks are going to walk away with.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:47.680]   Sure.
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:48.680]   Some kind of a Google tablet.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:49.680]   But we'll see.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:50.680]   It's sweet.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   That's supposedly a seven inch tablet.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.680]   I've heard.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:53.680]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:54.680]   I'm not.
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:57.680]   They gave two years ago they gave away the Galaxy 7 and I liked it.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.240]   I think it was maybe was the 10.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240]   No, it was the 10 one.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240]   The last year they gave.
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.480]   Was it the last year they gave away the 10 one?
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.880]   The with a tablet last year with them.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.880]   It's a year before that was the Chromebook, right?
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.880]   That's right.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:12.000]   I'm still holding out hope for glasses.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.560]   I want glasses.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.560]   I don't know about the glasses.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.680]   So what's with Larry Page's voice?
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.680]   Lots of conspiracies.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:20.760]   They at Google says no, he just lost his voice.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.560]   On the other hand, people are worried.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.080]   Might be sick.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.080]   Maybe he didn't want to.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.800]   He just didn't want to keynote.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.840]   I mean, if you lost your voice a week ago.
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.400]   He does not do public.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.440]   I think he must be shy.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.080]   He lost his voice a week ago and he skipped the stockholder meeting and now they're saying
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:43.040]   he's not going to be at Google I/O either.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:46.720]   He actually lost his voice calling up Larry Ellison late at night and laughing when I
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.080]   clean up the phone.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.800]   Larry Ellison bought the island of Lanai.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.520]   Who's laughing now?
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.520]   He did that because he was so depressed.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.000]   He needed a full spot.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.600]   I think he was spending the money he thought he was going to listen to Google.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.120]   And whoops.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.200]   Big money here.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.680]   Whoops.
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.440]   What do you do with an island of Lanai?
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.800]   Lanai's a nice island as I remember.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.000]   It's not Molokai.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.320]   It's not the leper island.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.200]   It's a nice island.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.400]   But something to remember about property in Hawaii by state law, there are no private
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.400]   beaches.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.400]   Ah.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:22.160]   All the beaches have to be accessible to the public.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.280]   Yeah, it's like that for Richard Branson's island too.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.280]   That's right.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.080]   It's the Queen's Island.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:31.200]   He apparently has a security force on the island.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.200]   He's got dogs.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:33.200]   He's got mines.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:34.200]   Yep.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.880]   Well, we get to sit on Larry's beach then.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.320]   Will he bring it to cocktail?
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.200]   We'll sail right up and he can't do a thing about it.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.560]   In fact, I think that would be the perfect place for a wedding.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.000]   On Larry's Island.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.640]   I've got him on speed dial.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:50.640]   Hey, yeah.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.360]   Actually, he's so blue-nised where Bill Gates got married, I thought.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.360]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.680]   So I'll carry that on.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:57.680]   That true.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:59.680]   He was owned by the pineapple people, the dole.
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:00.680]   Dole.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:02.680]   But that's right.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.480]   I forgot Bill Gates got married in Lanai.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:05.880]   It was a beautiful wedding.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.320]   That might have done it at least.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:12.400]   Larry Ellison is now officially in charge of Bill Gates' marriage.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.680]   And he has to go to Bill.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:19.480]   The good news is he got all the surface-to-air missiles that were installed for that wedding
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.680]   are still there.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.640]   So he's got the privacy he's been looking for.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:26.280]   And there's a hollowed-out volcano, so he'll be perfect.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.280]   It's very doctor-no.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.280]   It really is.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.280]   I just love it.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.320]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:37.440]   A couple more wacky stories like Larry Page is losing his voice and Larry Ellison buying
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.360]   an island.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.720]   And I haven't gotten to the 19-pin mini connector.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.360]   I got a vent.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.360]   Don't forget Facebook under 13.
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.360]   Let's talk about that.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.520]   This is a jam-packed show.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.000]   It's great to have you.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.240]   Larry Maggot, Ryan Block, and Padre, SJ, Father Robert Ballot.
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.520]   And to it, great to have you watching, too.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.400]   Before we take a break, let's check in with Tom Merrin.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.480]   See what's coming up in the week ahead, Tom.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.480]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:08.000]   There's a lot of stuff coming up in the week ahead.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.960]   Here's some of the things we'll be keeping track of on Tech News today.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.480]   Today, the Sony Xperia ION drops.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.640]   If you're interested in that, Monday, June 25th, Gadget Live in New York and the kickoff
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:19.200]   of O'Reilly Velocity.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:23.040]   Tuesday, the new extended cut ending for Mass Effect comes out.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.720]   Wednesday, June 27th kicks off Google I/O.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:28.320]   We expect some big new announcements from Google there.
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:34.120]   Also the EU Court is to rule on the $1.1 billion Microsoft find.
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.400]   Thursday, June 28th, RIM has its earnings.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.320]   Verizon's share everything plans go into effect.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:41.320]   And it's Tau Day.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.320]   Friday, June 29th, Sprint's Virgin Mobile iPhone comes.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.840]   Plans start at $30.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:50.040]   And June 30th is the last day for Mobile Me.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.600]   All that more, things will be keeping an eye on TNT.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.600]   Thank you, Tom.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:42:02.400]   We're at TNT, the daily news show that delivers every weekday, 3PM, 6PM, Eastern Time on
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:03.400]   twit.tv.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.880]   We will be covering Google I/O for sure.
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:13.120]   We'll do keynote coverage starting at 9.30 AM, Pacific 12.30 PM Eastern Time on Wednesday.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.680]   And if they do as they've done in the past, they sometimes do a Thursday keynote too.
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:18.320]   We'll probably cover that as well, right?
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.320]   Chad, if we figured out, we don't know.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.400]   We don't know what we're doing.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.400]   Stay tuned.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.120]   You can just watch all the time.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:27.040]   And we'll be sure to have something exciting.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.000]   Is Tau Day coming up?
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000]   Tau Day.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.040]   Oh, Tau Day.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.360]   I prefer Tau Day.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   I like Tau Day.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   You know Tau Day, right?
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.360]   Absolutely.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.360]   Don't forget to bring a towel.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.560]   Then don't panic.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.560]   What is Tau?
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.400]   Is that the Pi is 3.1 for what?
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.320]   What is Tau?
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.560]   Anybody chat room?
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:46.560]   6.28.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:49.600]   Who said that?
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.600]   Veronica Belmont.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.560]   Math whiz.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.760]   How do you know that?
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:56.760]   It's June 28th.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:57.760]   Oh, I get it.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.680]   But what is Tau used for?
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.680]   It's double Pi.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.680]   Ooh.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.680]   Do we get double Pi on Town Day?
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:12.960]   Hey, before we go on Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites, a wonderful
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:19.760]   place if you are ready to step up to the best server, the best content management system,
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.640]   always secure, always up to date.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.120]   I want you to visit squarespace.com.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.160]   You know, they make it so easy.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.520]   I love to see this in a company.
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:27.520]   This is confidence.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.680]   Hey, you want to try it?
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:29.680]   No problem.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:30.680]   Click the green button.
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:32.400]   You get the run of the place for two weeks.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.400]   No cost.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:34.400]   No credit card.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.400]   Nothing.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.240]   All you have to do is give your name, email address, a name for your site and a password.
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:41.680]   You can even uncheck the stay-in-touch box.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.760]   They won't bug you.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:48.240]   For two weeks, you got everything, the great Google fonts, 300 plus fonts.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.480]   You got the 85 plus custom templates.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:54.400]   If you, well, I'll save that for later when you buy.
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:57.520]   They have the iOS and Android apps that let you post.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:00.720]   They have beautiful photo galleries, widgets for all the social media.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:03.960]   It couldn't be easier to design a unique, beautiful site.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.620]   And then the hosting is so good.
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:09.040]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:13.960]   They do some very sophisticated stuff to make sure that there's always all the bandwidth
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.960]   you need.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.760]   If you're a podcaster, if you're a photographer, if you're an artist, if you're a business,
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:21.920]   if you need a website, you've got to check it out, squarespace.com.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:23.520]   Now here's the deal.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.480]   After the two weeks, do the two weeks.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:28.640]   You continue to, the site will continue on after the two weeks.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.600]   You then have the chance to subscribe.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:33.760]   Now they have month to month deals, but I recommend the annual deals.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.960]   In fact, if you do buy an annual deal, you'll save more on our Twitter offer.
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:42.840]   And if you get the annual deal, they will throw in a domain registration.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:45.400]   So if you've got, let's knittogether.com.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:48.400]   They'll get the whole, you get the site.
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:51.880]   Well, I'm sure you already have that, Kat, but they get the site.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.040]   Hey, could you bring me my Jane hat?
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.120]   It's in the, it's, you know, which one, the pom-pom.
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.760]   I want to wear the hat.
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.120]   If I want to do the show, I should wear the hat.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:03.080]   Yeah, Jammer Bee knows he was a fan.
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.200]   So you get the domain name, they hook it up.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.520]   So you get the referral and all that works.
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.520]   And the price is right.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:12.760]   So $8 a month is their standard when billed annually.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:15.840]   16 a month is their unlimited when billed annually.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.800]   And that means unlimited, I don't know how they do this.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:23.240]   Unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, and they do
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.560]   the domain name and all that stuff.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.560]   It is really great.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.560]   Squarespace.com/nothing.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:36.080]   Just go to squarespace.com and do the two weeks for you.
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:41.440]   But then sign up and use the offer code TWIT6 because you get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:44.840]   So that's going to be, if you sign up for the month, the yearly plan, you're going to
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:45.840]   save the most.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.840]   Isn't this nice, Kat?
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.320]   Nice, Kat, knit this for me.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.320]   You know what happens?
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.320]   She knit me one.
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.800]   This is this Jane hat from Firefly.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.520]   She knit me one and then Colleen, when Colleen left us, I said, "Take a hat, any hat from
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.520]   the collection."
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.240]   She took my Jane hat.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:01.800]   So very nice of you, Kat.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.800]   Thank you for knitting me another one.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.360]   How many people do we have in our studio audience today that's a full house, like 38 people?
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:11.520]   It's nice to have you all.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.280]   Thank you for visiting.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.560]   From the farthest away was Australia.
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.320]   I think we had a little competition.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.600]   I'm not giving you the Jane hat, though.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.800]   And the closest was, well, it's either between Chadme or Jammerby, we're not sure.
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:29.240]   The people who work here don't have long to go.
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.240]   Okay.
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.320]   Okay.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.640]   So you wanted to talk about 13-year-olds on Facebook.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.080]   Is Facebook actually, they can't change that policy because isn't that the Child Online
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.080]   Protection Act?
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:40.080]   Yes.
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:42.520]   The COPPA law would have to be obeyed.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.440]   They would have to get verified parental consent.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.040]   And that's absolutely what they're talking about.
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.880]   It turns out that there are millions of kids already on Facebook.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:50.880]   Oh, sure.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.400]   And a study found that 68% of them had their parents helping them.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.560]   So if Facebook were to officially invite kids under 13, parents would have to be involved.
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:02.160]   And how it would look, we don't know.
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.440]   They haven't made any announcements.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:07.680]   But I would envision that there would be parental controls, there'd be some kind of
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:09.320]   parental dashboard.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:12.880]   The parents would have access to what the kids are doing.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:17.440]   And they would actually cater to these children as opposed to the fact that now they're in
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.840]   there, they're lying about their age.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.440]   They may say they're 13, they may say they're 30.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.000]   But whatever they're doing, they're not getting any protections whatsoever.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:30.480]   So I think that kind of a sandbox version of Facebook would be a good thing for kids under
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:31.480]   under 13.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:35.360]   Now, Larry has been very involved with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:38.120]   He does the Safe Kids site, SafeKids.com.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.440]   So you're more than aware, more than usual aware of the dangers online for kids.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.080]   I think there's somewhat overblown.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:46.040]   But of course, you're in public, basically.
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:49.640]   And I think sometimes parents and kids think, well, he's in his bedroom.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.480]   How much trouble could he get into?
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.200]   And that's the point is it is kind of public.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.080]   You're in as much risk, I guess, as you'd be at the mall.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:58.760]   Well, actually you're in less risk.
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.920]   Well, you know, physically.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.920]   It is overblown.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:04.320]   The predator issue is way overblown.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:08.680]   But there are issues of reputation management, bullying, kids who are just saying things that
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.680]   they shouldn't be saying.
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:10.680]   That's a bigger issue, isn't it?
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:12.360]   Yeah, much, much bigger issue.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:17.720]   And I think that Facebook needs to have tools to help parents prevent those kinds of problems.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.400]   I'm not as worried about predators as I am about kids just doing dumb things.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:24.240]   They'd get them into some kind of trouble.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:28.280]   And let's face it, when you're talking about a 10-year-old or a 9-year-old, there's performance
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.400]   anxiety, how they behave on Facebook, lots of issues.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.880]   So if they're going to be there and they're there anyway, I say be there with some kind
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.000]   of parental controls.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.080]   And I'm hoping Facebook does something.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:43.040]   And a lot of internet safety advocates have been pushing them for a long time.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:46.000]   There's this myth that they're doing it just to make more money.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.520]   That may or may not be true.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:51.400]   But they've also been pressured to do it from some of us in the internet safety community.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.440]   I actually don't think it should be limited just at kids under 13.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:49:01.520]   I mean, I can't imagine letting a 14 or a 15 or even a 16-year-old just go wild on
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:03.400]   Facebook with zero supervision.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.400]   Yeah, parents invite them.
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.720]   I think having those tools would be amazing.
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:09.120]   But the reason parents, and I'll speak, as a parent, the reason parents let their kids
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:12.080]   use Facebook at a younger age, I did not.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.440]   But some parents do.
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:19.000]   And I know, I have family that is because this is nowadays how kids socialize.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.160]   It's how they interact.
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.160]   You cut that off.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.880]   You're cutting off a vital lifeline.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:27.760]   It's like telling a teenager from our generation, Larry, not to use the phone.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.760]   That's right.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.680]   And by the way, I am on Facebook safety advisory board.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.920]   So clearly they will get advice.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.200]   And we have a booklet called Facebook for Parents or Parents Guide to Facebook, which
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.440]   is at FBparents.org.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:43.080]   That's FB is in Facebookparents.org.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:48.080]   And that's the online free version of a 40-page booklet that explains to parents how they
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:50.240]   can parent in the 21st century.
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.920]   So I urge people to take a look.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.240]   And I agree with you.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:59.000]   Whether your kids are four or 14 or for that matter, 40, there should be some kind of control.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.280]   I'm not sure about 40, but maybe not rental control, self-control.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.760]   I need some controls.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:04.760]   Trust me.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.560]   You saw the blather I post on Facebook.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.720]   I do issues here, though.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.560]   The first issue is, okay, maturity of the child or maturity of the young adult.
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.400]   And you made a very good point, which is there are some very mature 10-year-olds and there
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.440]   are some very immature 30-year-olds.
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:22.840]   But I don't see that as big of a problem as the implementation, which is when you've
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.680]   got a 10-year-old who is most likely more tech-savvy than his parents, how do you make
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:29.360]   sure that he uses this?
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:33.880]   I mean, if he knows that his Facebook activity is going to be monitored, isn't he just going
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.880]   to make another account?
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:38.120]   That's where the anxiety comes from from parents, is that we don't feel like we under
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:43.040]   -- I do, but I always knew more than my kids did, but most parents go, "Oh, they run rings
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:44.040]   around me."
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.040]   Right.
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.280]   We hear that all the time, and parents need to be parents.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:52.320]   Look, I supervise my kids in their soccer games, and I know nothing about soccer, but
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:56.600]   I know something about sportsmanship and teamwork and just being there for my kids.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.600]   And I think the same thing is true for the online world.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:03.960]   You don't have to be a tech genius to be a good parent, even though you need to be aware
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:06.840]   of the technology, just like I'm kind of aware of soccer.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:08.840]   I think Larry nailed it.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.680]   You have to have their conversations.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:12.120]   You have to be present.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.200]   By the way, Facebook did.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.520]   If you ever wondered what happens when you report something on Facebook, Facebook released
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:20.880]   an infographic that is hysterical.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.600]   This is the decision tree.
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:23.600]   This is not made up.
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.640]   This is from Facebook.
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:28.000]   They have committees and teams.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.160]   Well, you can imagine there's a safety team.
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:32.760]   There's a hate and harassment team.
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.680]   There's an abusive content team.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.960]   There's an access team.
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:39.200]   I'm still waiting to hear back from the report on an imposter team.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:40.920]   I have a Facebook imposter right now.
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:41.920]   And you haven't heard back.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:42.920]   How long has it been?
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.640]   A day or two.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:45.640]   Somebody posted.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:51.520]   They're actually using it to establish friendships with very important people in the industry.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:58.120]   I think they established friendship with Lisa, your CEO, Tom Merritt.
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:00.360]   Oh, the person who's impersonating you?
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.960]   Lisa, so that wasn't Ryan.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:04.840]   So how do we know what's the real Ryan Block on Facebook?
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:05.840]   It's always been the same.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:07.640]   It's just like facebook.com/RionBalk.
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:08.640]   That's a problem.
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:11.640]   When somebody impersonates you and they have a picture of you and they say, "Would you be
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:12.840]   my friend?"
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.240]   I might be fooled by that.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:16.600]   Now would I know that it's not the Ryan Block?
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:17.600]   Yeah, I know.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:20.360]   I don't think that anybody did anything wrong.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:22.320]   I probably would have done the same thing.
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:23.320]   It's messed up.
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:26.240]   You have very little recourse.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.240]   There was a post on it.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.240]   Facebook, they've got a huge...
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:32.640]   The infographic is kind of funny, but they do have a huge infrastructure.
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:36.440]   Imagine they've got 900 million Ireland.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:40.160]   And they're working on making reporting, getting feedback from reporting better, but
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.160]   they've got a waste of ghosting.
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.160]   No, I'm impressed.
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.320]   I didn't look at this and go, "Oh yeah, that'll work."
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:49.040]   I looked at it and said, "Wow, think about the difficulty, the challenge of Facebook
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:51.400]   faces every single day."
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:54.200]   There was a really interesting post on...
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.200]   What is that?
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:56.200]   Is that it?
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:57.200]   That's the same thing.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:52:59.200]   There was a really interesting post.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:00.200]   You're trying to read it.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:03.680]   Post, I think, was on Hacker News about a guy who was memorialized.
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.480]   So you know there's a...
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:10.920]   If you die, your friends can memorialize your Facebook page and lock it down.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.160]   It says, "This person's dead, but you can put a memorial here."
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:15.920]   He's not dead yet.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:17.720]   Oh.
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:20.240]   That's an interesting prank.
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:23.320]   And now that I've mentioned it, it can only be a matter of time before somebody kills me
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.320]   on Facebook.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:26.400]   I probably shouldn't say anything.
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:29.280]   So you should log into Facebook every day to find out if you're still alive.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.280]   Make sure you're alive.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.240]   It's like checking the obituary on the newspaper.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:35.400]   Yeah, you don't want to read your obituary.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.400]   No.
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:37.400]   Actually, I would like to read my obituary.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:38.400]   I already wrote mine.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.400]   Yeah, just submit it.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:40.400]   Exactly.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.320]   I'm almost dead.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.840]   Facebook forced to allow users to opt out of advertisements.
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:49.160]   When I read this, I thought, "Oh, this is good, but it's not what you think."
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:50.160]   You can...
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:51.160]   This is a legal settlement.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:56.080]   I think it happened in the UK, but I'm sure Facebook will have to do this globally.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:59.880]   You know how sometimes they use your name and sponsored stories.
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:00.880]   Whether you would...
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:02.160]   You don't get any money for it.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:04.200]   It's like an ad with your name.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.600]   Ryan Block loves depends.
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.600]   And then...
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:08.600]   And that's true.
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:11.200]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:13.240]   That was my profile.
[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:16.520]   And then, well, now you can opt out apparently.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:21.600]   Five users were annoyed about their faces being used as part of Facebook's sponsored stories,
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.600]   which allow companies to use the photos and names of people who have liked a brand.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:26.960]   I see this all the time.
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.600]   Robert Scoble likes everything.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:29.600]   He really does.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:32.520]   He likes everything.
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:34.520]   So whenever I log into Facebook, there it is.
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:37.800]   Robert Scoble likes Crest Brethmans.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.800]   He really does like everything.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:44.600]   Actually, I posted on Twitter, I posted the simple guide to figuring out which of your
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.600]   friends to unfriend on Facebook.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:49.200]   And it takes you to which of your friends have like Nickelback?
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:50.200]   Oh.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.680]   And if they have Nickelback, you shouldn't like them.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.680]   Now see, look.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:57.080]   Unfortunately, Ryan Block, I'm already your friend.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.080]   That's the fake.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.080]   Yeah, that's the fake one.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.080]   That's the fake one.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:02.600]   And Facebook's suggesting it to me, which is bad because...
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:06.160]   Yeah, and that's how I actually heard about it is my real friend started pinging me and
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:08.840]   saying, "Hey, did something happen to your account?
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:09.840]   Why are you on there?"
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.520]   It's suggesting me to befriend you, but we're already friends.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:14.520]   And yeah.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.760]   I am sorry.
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:16.760]   That sucks.
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:17.760]   Yeah, it does suck.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:18.760]   Everybody go report them.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.680]   What is the benefit to that person?
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.080]   He's just making trouble?
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.080]   I don't know.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:24.080]   Troll.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.080]   Troll.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:26.080]   Troll.
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:28.080]   See how sticky this is?
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.320]   I'm starting to look at my Facebook page.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.320]   You can't...
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.320]   It's like, oh, I opened it.
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:35.520]   I shouldn't have opened it because now I want to post.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.160]   I'm on Twitter.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.480]   I hate it and I love it.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:42.840]   I'm on Twitter right now.
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:46.480]   Are you right back?
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:49.240]   Nike gets in a little trouble in the UK.
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:53.960]   Apparently Nike has some tame soccer players.
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:55.440]   They call them footballers.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:57.600]   Wayne Rooney and Jack Wellesher.
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:01.120]   Nike said, "Look, everybody in the UK knows these guys do our endorsements."
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:06.320]   They tweeted using a Nike website and a Nike hashtag.
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:11.040]   And they're really tough in Great Britain on this kind of stuff.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:15.600]   And the Advertising Standards Authority says, "No."
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.040]   And they said, "Nike, you can't do that anymore."
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:21.560]   We don't have anything like that in the US.
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:23.240]   You can post anything you want.
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:26.120]   No, we do.
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.920]   You can't tweet from the end zone.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:29.920]   That's not allowed.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:32.640]   There was a lot of that was passed.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.840]   It was a year or two ago about online celebrity endorsements.
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:38.800]   You have to say ad or something.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:41.720]   Basically, you have to disclose the relationship.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:43.120]   And block your disgusting.
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.640]   You can't disclose freebies.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.800]   When you blog, I think, and you get something free.
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.840]   You're supposed to disclose that now.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:49.840]   FTC rule.
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:50.840]   Good.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.960]   Finally, I've got to it.
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:57.960]   The new iPhone, according to a lot of people, including TechCrunch and we saw the mobile
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.840]   fun video, will no longer have a 30-pin port.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:03.120]   Ryan, tell me it ain't so.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:09.440]   A 19-pin port that will make every cable, every dock, even that $200 radio I bought,
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:10.440]   incompatible.
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:14.360]   Leo, I'm sorry, but I'm going to come on the record.
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:17.320]   I've been saying for years that they need to phase out that old-school iPod.
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:18.600]   I guess it is old-
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:21.760]   I mean, it's huge.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:25.240]   It was built in another era for another kind of product.
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:27.240]   It's not meant for what it is.
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:30.560]   It's like the biggest single thing about the iPhone besides the screen.
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:31.560]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:34.120]   They have to build the whole phone around that port right now.
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:36.800]   I've thousands of dollars invested.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:39.400]   You know, I'm sure they'll figure out an adapter solution.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:41.800]   Oh, yeah, everything's getting a little wire hanging on.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:43.600]   Which would be fine if mine was pretty.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:44.600]   How about docks?
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:45.600]   You're going to have a little...
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.000]   Don't do a stock.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.400]   I have that renew radio.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.040]   They all have 30-pin connectors.
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.040]   What am I going to do?
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.040]   It's going to be ugly for a couple of years.
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:55.040]   And don't you think every Android device uses this little guy?
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.040]   Yes.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:57.040]   It's a USB.
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:59.480]   But you can buy USB port doesn't do everything.
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:03.520]   Yeah, this presumably 19-pin port will do more than the micro-USB port that's...
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.520]   Right.
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:07.160]   And, you know, there's no standardization around that USB port.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:09.560]   But it would if they had adopted MHL.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:10.560]   They could do all the documents.
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.080]   MHL is newer, right?
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:15.160]   We've been using micro-USB in phones and it was ratified.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:20.280]   Micro-USB specifically was ratified as a standard in EU for all phone ports.
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.600]   And it doesn't support data...
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:24.400]   Or I'm sorry, it doesn't support audio, analog audio.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.120]   It only supports the raw data in charging.
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:29.720]   So it's not as equipped as, you know, what we think of as being like a proper stock.
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.880]   You're saying it could if it were an MHL?
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.600]   It could, but he's right.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.880]   It doesn't transport analog audio, so you would need some sort of digital analog here
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:38.880]   within the device.
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.360]   That's fine.
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:42.720]   That's what the earphone port is for.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:43.920]   No, but it's...
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:46.640]   You care because that would make your dock not work.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:47.640]   Oh.
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.440]   But this is already going to make some stock not work.
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:51.840]   Yeah, I'm screwed no matter what.
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:53.920]   Well, look, it's going to happen sooner later.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.920]   I guess.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:55.920]   So would you rather happen sooner?
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.920]   No, but you know, I have to say it's risky because I may not buy a new iPhone because
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.920]   I don't...
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.440]   I want to keep my old iPhone and keep all that compatibility, right?
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:07.640]   Won't people stick with a 4S?
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:12.160]   I have this really expensive audio system that connects to an iPhone.
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:13.160]   Yes.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:14.720]   And maybe they'll make an adapter, I don't know.
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:17.520]   But do I throw it away?
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:20.560]   You know, I'd really like to see as a, like, a trade-in program.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.800]   You know, bring in one cable, get it on the back.
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:24.720]   Bring in one dock, get a new dock.
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:27.040]   I don't think they can do that for the docks, but, you know, maybe make some.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.040]   You know, they did.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:32.560]   If I could do another show on tell here, they did for the new MacBook Airs and the new Retina.
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:33.560]   They came up with it.
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.560]   Oh, this is the ridiculousest thing ever invented.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:36.560]   It's like a 10 bucks, right?
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:41.360]   This is for $10 if you get to use your old MagSafe device.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:44.920]   You know, my favorite thing about that layer is you did...
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:47.160]   They didn't need to make the MagSafe 2.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:49.080]   It's totally fixed on an air.
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:51.080]   What's the problem?
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:52.080]   I have no idea why I do that.
[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:53.080]   It's not better.
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:54.080]   It's not more pins.
[01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:55.080]   It's not different.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:56.240]   It's just physically different.
[01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:59.920]   And now they get 10 bucks out of me and none of these work.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:02.320]   That is the single reason not the buy a Retina.
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:03.760]   Yeah, it's pretty irritating.
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:04.760]   Really?
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:06.560]   When I saw the story, I thought of this...
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:07.840]   There was a mini Cooper at USB.
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:10.480]   It was a special edition, very well decked out.
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:17.360]   And it had a perfectly formed dock for an iPhone 4S.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.360]   And so now...
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.360]   You need to do a car now.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.360]   You need to do a car now.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:22.360]   And make it work with the new phone.
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:24.560]   It's fantastic.
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:27.360]   And by the way, okay, we're gonna leave...
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:33.520]   Tom left this out of the story, but the Higgs Boson has probably been discovered.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.520]   Right?
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.360]   Big story, right?
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:38.360]   Mm.
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:39.360]   Okay.
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:40.360]   Okay.
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.880]   How about this?
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:46.240]   Time Warner patents a method for disabling fast forward on DVRs.
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.240]   How dare they?
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.240]   I am out right now.
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:49.240]   Sons of beaches.
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:51.240]   That's really important.
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:53.560]   All right.
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:54.560]   What a great panel.
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.560]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:56.560]   I gotta thank you.
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:57.560]   This has been a lot of fun.
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:01.880]   We ran out of time with so much more we could talk about, but you know, life is short.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:06.360]   Twitter's long.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:07.920]   Thank you so much, Larry Maggot.
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.080]   Larrysworld.com and SafeKids.com.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.280]   Great to see you.
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.840]   Good to see you.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.160]   Next time, come here.
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:17.160]   I will.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.160]   Come to me.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:19.160]   I'm Larry Maggot on Twitter.
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:21.160]   I love Petaluma.
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:23.320]   Robert will turn water into wine.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:24.320]   Absolutely.
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:26.800]   Just bring me a bunch of water and tell me if you like better wine.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:28.320]   Buy a bottle.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:31.400]   Robert Ballis, sir, the future host of "Twiet."
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:32.880]   I think we're gonna call it "Twiet."
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:33.880]   "Twiet."
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:34.880]   Not "Tweet."
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:35.880]   It's very French sounding.
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.120]   This week in Enterprise Tech, "Twiet."
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.120]   "Twiet."
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.120]   "Twiet."
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:41.880]   He's gonna be wonderful.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:46.680]   And of course you can find him at the techstop.net.
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:47.920]   That's where your podcast lives.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:48.920]   Absolutely.
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:49.920]   Great to have you, Bob.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:50.920]   Can I call you Bob?
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:51.920]   Sure.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:52.920]   You know what he calls you, Bob.
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:55.920]   My dad's Bob, but in the brick house I guess I'm Bob.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:56.920]   I don't know.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:59.320]   Just father Bob sounds good.
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.680]   I thought it was "Firetech."
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:03.080]   "Firetech's good, too."
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.080]   Come here.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.080]   Veronica, come here.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:06.080]   We're saying goodbye.
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:07.880]   You'll be on for three seconds.
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:09.160]   Please.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.440]   We just want everybody to congratulate our newly affanced.
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:15.520]   What'd she say?
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:18.280]   Don't try to marry her right now.
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:19.280]   Come on.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:20.680]   Now just join hands.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.720]   Great to have you.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.800]   Congratulations, both Ryan and Veronica.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:27.600]   Ryan Block at GDGT.com.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:29.240]   Tuesday's the event in New York City.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:30.240]   Monday.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.240]   Monday.
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:32.240]   Okay, sorry.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.240]   Monday's event.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:34.240]   Go to GDGT.com to find more.
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:35.240]   Yeah, details are there.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.240]   And congratulations.
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:37.240]   Thank you very much.
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:38.240]   We're so happy for you, too.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:39.240]   I'm very happy.
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:40.240]   That's really great.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:41.240]   Let me see it again.
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.240]   Oh my God.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:43.240]   Let's hear it for him.
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.240]   All right.
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:45.240]   Thank you.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:46.240]   The reception will be later.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:48.240]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:49.240]   We do this weekend.
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:50.880]   What day is this?
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:57.440]   Today, Sunday, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2200 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:58.520]   We love it if you watch live.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.520]   We've got a great chatroom.
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:04.240]   It's a great way to give us some feedback and to tell me when I'm wrong, which I greatly
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:05.240]   appreciate.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.880]   By the way, is there an SSD in that ring?
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.360]   A little bit of memory.
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.360]   You know?
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:11.360]   512 gigs.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:12.360]   Just a little something.
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.360]   Something.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.680]   There's some laser-etch data on the inside.
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:16.680]   Is there really?
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:17.680]   No.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.880]   Like her DNA?
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:19.880]   Right.
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:20.880]   Yeah.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:23.880]   But if you don't get to watch live, don't worry, because you can download the audio and
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.400]   video after the fact that twit.tv would make it available in all forms, including soon
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:29.760]   when?
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:30.920]   When Chad Johnson?
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:31.920]   When?
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:32.920]   HD 720p.
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:33.920]   It's available now.
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.920]   Six months ago?
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:35.920]   Yeah, six months ago.
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:36.920]   Oh, six months ago?
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:39.120]   Well, a while back we had HD.
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:40.120]   Oops.
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:43.160]   Other shows are rolling out, though, right now.
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:44.560]   What year is it?
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:46.560]   Awkward.
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:48.040]   I don't watch.
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:49.600]   You can tell now.
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.600]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:52.960]   We'll see you next time.
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:54.720]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:55.720]   Bye-bye, everybody.
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:58.360]   And what a great live audience.
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:03:59.360]   Wow.
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.120]   There's like 8,000 different.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:04.120]   Two on the twit.
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:05.120]   All right.
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.120]   Two on the twit, baby.
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.120]   Two on the twit.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:08.120]   All right.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:08.900]   I'll be doing a twist!
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:09.740]   - All right.
