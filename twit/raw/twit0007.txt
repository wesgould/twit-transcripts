[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   This is this Week in Tech, Episode 7.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.680]   Recorded June 2nd, distributed June 4th, 2005.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240]   The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.920]   And it looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon sport on this, the 127th, up on Class
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.080]   Twitter the Year, Chef.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.840]   And now for something completely different.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.400]   We are all Twitch now.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.560]   For that, three, two, three!
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.520]   Excellent.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.520]   Look out!
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   Is everybody's recording?
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.520]   Yes, recording.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520]   Okay.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.520]   And here's Slamdance's industry.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.520]   I'm calling him again, I don't know.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520]   Oh, he just popped up saying he signed on, so...
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   Oh, good.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   Yeah, well, I see him.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.520]   I just, he's not answering.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.520]   I talked to Pat a little while ago.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   He was playing with connectors on his mic or something.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520]   Yeah, he's still soldering.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520]   Oh, no, he has the connectors.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   Oh, I just got that 45-inch Sharp Aqua synth.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.520]   What a lovely, lovely display.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.520]   Oh, nice.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.520]   1080p.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.520]   Oh, it's 1080p.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520]   Yeah, 45 inches.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   How much?
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520]   Yeah, 8 grand.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   8 grand.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520]   Well, it's not bad.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.520]   Now, I mean, it's state of the art for what Sharp's doing right now, and there aren't many displays
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520]   you can buy right now that are, I don't think there is one larger.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.520]   It's actually out on the market yet.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   I'm going to call Robert here in P-Tip because he's the 1080p guy or 1080p tip.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.520]   Hey, the cool new trend is with a smaller flat panel, so the 37-inch.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   Everyone's shooting at 37 inches with 1080p now, and they're all for around two grand or less.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   So when it's 1080p, that means that the native resolution of the screen from top to bottom is at least 1,080 pixels.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.520]   Right.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520]   Are they typically more than that or?
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   It's actually 1920x1080 for fixed pixel formats.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   Can plasmid?
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520]   Are they doing any plasmids with that resolution?
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   Sure, but it's up in the 70-plus inch range, which is $50,000 on up.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   Okay.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.520]   So if you want 1080p and you're going to start seeing more and more 1080p, I def, I'll see these the way to go.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   I really hope that's going.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.520]   I mean, Windows Media, give them credit for their high definition effort at least, but at least they include 1080p in all their published formats or as far as what you can buy in the store.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   Like the Terminator 2 disc, and I'm also watching, oh, what is it called?
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   Coral Reef Adventure.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   The Coral Reef Adventure.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   It's a...
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   It's a wild, right?
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520]   Yeah, but it is just...
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   But it's just coral reef, right?
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   That's true.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   It's lots underwater.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   Is Schwartz an egg or an egg?
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520]   Liam Neeson narrating it.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   See, this was, remember when HD first came out and you'd go to the trade shows and all these Japanese companies would be there with aquariums?
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   It's like, come on.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.520]   We want something...
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   You don't buy an HD TV to watch fish.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   No.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   I don't think.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   Well, PC graphics too, initially pushed it on just because you could do...
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   You already had high def in a PC, and if you could just come up with the right format graphic, it would look pretty sharp.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   The problem I'm running into actually with that sharp 46 inch right now, or 45 inches, that even though it's 1080p, I don't believe DVI or any digital format currently supports 1080p as far as I can tell.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   Oh, you mean you can't put it out of anything that you've got?
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   Well, I can do it through component, but not digitally right now, which is something I...
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   Like the native PC resolutions 12 by 10.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   Why would that be?
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   I mean, digital isn't specified what the resolution is.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   I think it's a bandwidth issue, to be perfectly honest with the current spec, especially with DVI.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   I'm less certain with HDMI, and that's something I'm looking into right now.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   You know, if it's DVI, it's going to be HDMI because it's the same thing, it's just a different electrical connector, right?
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   It should.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   No, I mean, it is totally backward compatible, but I was a little bummed that I couldn't...
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   It was a little bummed that I couldn't just simply turn my PC on with a DVI connection to 1080p.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.520]   That's a real limitation.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   But I'm willing to bet I can do it with a component.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   I'm about to find out anyway.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.520]   Patrick just sent me a note saying he blew his power supply.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.520]   Don't tell me switching to another system.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.520]   Patrick's having so many problems I'm having lately.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.520]   Hey, I have to tell you something.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   I feel a little guilty here. I actually bought a PC laptop, and worse than that, it's a tablet PC.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   Oh, no.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.520]   Oh, I know. I feel like I've gone over to the other side.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   Hey, man.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   Hey, there he is.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.520]   Okay.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   I went on vocals every one.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   It's stupid and blew up a power supply.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   Now, Patrick, are you... is your recorder on right now?
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.520]   What's that?
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.520]   Don't say anything unless your recorder is on.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.520]   I can't.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.520]   Oh.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.520]   I realize that I can't find the adapter for the microphone.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.520]   Patrick's the only one who got a microphone that actually came with a connector.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   With a quarter-inch connector.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   And you say you can't... oh, I see.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   You don't have a headphone adapter.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   I have a good four or five of them, but right now I started packing up my house.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.520]   Patrick, I don't care.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   Just still plug in the recorder and record yourself on the...
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520]   Okay.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.520]   At least we'll get a high quality recording that way.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.520]   Okay.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   I have seven... no, actually, oh, yeah, it isn't there.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   And then turn it to MP3 64 kilobits.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   Already did that.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   So that way you'll get enough on there.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   I spent the 45 minutes working through the manual to get that set up.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   So, ladies and gentlemen, this is like the part in Wizard of Oz where it goes from black
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   and white to color.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   Patrick Knight Norton's about to go from Skype to high quality audio.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520]   That's better.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   Okay.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   Hey, guys.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.520]   So, I got a hot tip for everybody.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.520]   Seriously hot tip.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   If you're going to stop the fan on your big expensive computer so that the wine from the
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   really loud power supply you haven't replaced, even though you have a brand new power supply
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.520]   sitting in the room with you that you haven't installed yet.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   When you're using that little removable steel tab that, you know, the card slot cover, don't
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   stick it in too far or there'll be a loud pop and the power will stop.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   So you're using the card slot to physically stop the fan?
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.520]   Well, now I'm not because the power supply's dead.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   Dude, you're shooting for a Darwin award.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   Oh, you just catch up on that part of my life.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   Part of the fun of working with Patrick is the risk.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.520]   Somebody gave me a revision .1 motherboard that wasn't a brand new box and I went and installed
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   it and I'm having more issues than I care to describe right now.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.520]   And then I realized it is a revision .1 so they probably got free before it ever came out
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   and I'm ready to throw it out the window.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   Have you guys heard about the bad caps problem?
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   Oh, where they were having problems, the capacitors blowing up?
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   What do you think of that?
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.520]   Is that BS or is that the real deal?
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.520]   That was really about a year or two ago.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.520]   You don't know.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   So it's all better now?
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.520]   There was just a significant issue.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   There was the whole problem where they would leak and become an A, it's pretty corrosive material inside of there.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   Bad caps.net is the website.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.520]   So you think that that's all water under the bridge?
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.520]   I mean, as soon as it came to light, it seemed that there was an immediate reaction.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   Everybody took a good look at whose brand they were using and putting a little more quality
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.520]   I think into that one part.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   Yeah, these are pretty old.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.520]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   They are pretty old motherboard.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.520]   Well, it's kind of scary when you think about, I mean, you know, you think about the amount of little tiny parts
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.520]   that go together to make a motherboard, you know, or an MP3 player or a video recorder.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.520]   If somebody screws up or run a capacitors.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   Yeah, two more resistors.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   Two cent parts.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520]   Well, and that's what happened.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   Apparently there's a batch of leaky capacitors that got into a bunch of motherboards.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520]   Quality control.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   Well, yeah.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   Well, and especially when, you know, your margins are razor thin and you're trying to crank this stuff out.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.520]   It's true.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   And they don't want to recall the parts and replace them like they should.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.520]   Well, that's true too.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.520]   Well, they learned that from Pino Detroit.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   Yeah, I saw a fight club.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   I know how the automobile industry works.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   Take the cost or recall.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   Actually lawsuits.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   Patrick, you're going to be mad at me.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   I bought a tablet PC.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   I'm not mad at you.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.520]   I'm laughing at you.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   I have a question.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   Here's the worst part.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   Well, at least you're away from Tiger now.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   I kind of like it.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   You're using it to browse in the bathroom?
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.520]   Do you take it in the bathroom with you in the mornings?
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   Yeah, I think there needs to be a 12-step program for me for a tablet PC.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.520]   I can't stop using.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   So you join on the screen all the time?
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   Well, you know what I bought it for us for the TV show?
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   Because I wish we'd had these when we were doing the screen savers.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.520]   Because you can bring up a web page and hold it up to the camera and point and just
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.520]   articulate and do all the stuff they tried to make us do with that football.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   With a football problem?
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   And also it's flat.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.520]   So it's not like this big honking thing sitting in front of you.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   You're just holding a tablet.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.520]   So I think particularly for Amber's web workshop, it's going to be really great.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.520]   Because she shows sites, she can highlight circle.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.520]   I put Visio on it so she can use Visio to quickly do mock-ups and stuff.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   I think it's going to be a good way to do that kind of stuff anyway.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   Well sure. You're a vertical industry Leo, much like hospitals and insurance
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.520]   adjusters.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.520]   I kind of like it.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   You know the ink is kind of neat.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.520]   You write your stuff.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   And I'm using one note and the Franklin Planner folks have a day planner program.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   And it holds the ink.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.520]   And then if you want to turn it into text, it does a fairly good, you know,
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   it's a lot better than the Newton.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.520]   What's the battery life on it?
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   I got an HP, the 4200.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.520]   I think TC4200.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   And it's a Pentium M.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.520]   And I'm getting about three hours.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.520]   It's not a huge, but it's a tiny battery.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.520]   You're going to have to get a supplementary battery.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.520]   But it's a little, you know, it's a small one.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.520]   It's not a big one.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   It's 1024x768, 12 inch screen.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.520]   And you said it's definitely better than the Newton.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.520]   It is better than the Newton.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.520]   It's kind of cool.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.520]   You know, but now Patrick, you have to explain to me because you're the one who always said
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   never, you know, you like these little micro notebooks, sub notebooks that don't have
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   a CD.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   How do you install stuff on it?
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   I'm using an external CD or do it over the network.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.520]   The truth is it's actually, it's getting, until you get into the really sub sub notebook,
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.520]   I don't even know what you call them, the ones that are running like the three quarter screens
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.520]   where it's 1024x76, you know, 620, stuff like that.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.520]   That's what I have.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.520]   It's getting really hard to actually find a five pound notebook that doesn't have an
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   optical spindle in it anymore.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   I think it should because I would like to be able to, I kind of, you know, I mean, I
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   got this for the TV show so it's not as critical, but I think if I were going to buy one all
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.520]   the time, I want one that has a DVD player and a CD burner.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   Right.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   So my IBM T40 has, I love that.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   That's a great notebook.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.520]   It's just small enough and it's tough and the keyboard's awesome.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   T series is an amazing series for IBM.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.520]   That and the little light they put at the top of the screen, you can turn on and off because
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   I work in a dark, you know, dark lab with the...
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   But I like the tablet, but it's not a tablet, right?
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   It's just a regular laptop.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   This is a convertible.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.520]   So you get the kind of the best of both worlds as long as the hinge doesn't break, which
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   I'm sure...
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.520]   Can you guys still handle 1024 by 768?
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   I can't take it anymore.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.520]   I cannot work on anything that's 1024 by 768.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.520]   Yeah, I can.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   But my phone's small enough.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   I'm old.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   I have bad eyes.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   When you get too high a res for me, I can't see this.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   Everything's too tiny.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.520]   Yeah, it depends on the res, but I haven't been able to find that many laptops that support
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.520]   up to like 16 by 12.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   The new, you might like the new, there's a new tablet PC, I think it's a Toshiba.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.520]   16 by 12.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   16 by 12 is really small.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.520]   I mean, that's a really...
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.520]   That's a lot of resolution for...
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.520]   But anything for...
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.520]   You have young eyes, Kevin.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   Yeah, anything like...
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.520]   I'm using, what is it, a lot of 11 by 19?
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.520]   A 19 inch monitor.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.520]   And I find that's just about kind of a perfect balance without having to, you know, boost
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.520]   the DPI or anything to achieve.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.520]   Well, you can always do that.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.520]   You can make the, you know, eye context bigger and all that stuff.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   I mean, you don't have to...
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.520]   But you know what, it kind of screws up some of the menus that pop up and things like that.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.520]   It doesn't scale everything properly, which I guess Apple supposedly does a little bit
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   better, which wouldn't surprise me.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.020]   Well, I ran into a big problem with it.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.820]   I was helping a friend by a laptop for doing CAD work and he had to have a minimum of
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.520]   1280 by 1024 for the program to work.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:20.420]   And so he ended up having to go with like Voodoo is like $5,000 absolute top of the line card
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.520]   with the Quadra FX card in it.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   Wow.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.320]   I normally found that when I was looking for a laptop, I have a Dell that's 600,000
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.820]   hundred D. And it was like a custom option that you had to order, you know, it was like
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.820]   the, what do they call that?
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.320]   Like the SXGA plus screen.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.320]   That's 16 bucks.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   Extra hundred bucks or so, but I...
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.320]   Well, that's not bad.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.320]   But that was like a, that's a 15 inch monitor on that 16 inch.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   14, actually.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   Wow.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   See, that's too high a resolution for 14 inches.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   I have 14 inches.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   10 by 7 and it works out just great.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   You're crazy.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.840]   Hey, interesting.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.640]   One of my sponsors on the radio show is a DSL provider just announced that they are now
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:09.800]   offering normal DSL, you know, 1.5 megabit DSL for 15 bucks a month.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   I read that.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   Can you...
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   For how long?
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.200]   SBC's done it and so now everybody's dropping.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   Can you believe...
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.360]   Is that for six months or is that an interview?
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.360]   I don't know about SBC's.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.560]   I think SBC's a few months, but these guys are going to be getting for a year.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.760]   15 bucks.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   That's great.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.280]   I really think we're just going to start to see big 10 price wars in high speed internet.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.280]   It's about time.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.760]   Yeah, because you know, the big companies are going to kill off the little ones.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   That happened before though.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.880]   Remember, they were all these little ISPs and now there aren't.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.480]   Whatever happened to Vario.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.880]   Remember Vario bought everybody?
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.880]   Are they still around?
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.760]   Yeah, they're still around.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.040]   Are they still in ISP?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.600]   You don't hear about?
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   I don't think so.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.120]   They think about everybody.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   Hold on.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.600]   I used the same person that sponsors you.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.120]   I don't want to mention their names because it's not an ad for them.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.280]   Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.520]   I know who it is.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.560]   That's why I say the same company.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.280]   They were my residential service when I was in Oakland.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.360]   I loved them.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   So here's the deal.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.640]   They're going to give me and the new...
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.200]   I'm moving this all next week into an outside office out of the house.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:24.160]   Because it's two blocks from the central office, I can finally get, I think, 512 up.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.720]   So I'm going to get like three megabits down 512 up, something like that.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.480]   Whatever their top of the line is.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.720]   And then I'm going to have it home.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   I'm going to have Comcast.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.680]   So it's going to be very interesting to compare the two.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.960]   I used to always like cable better.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   I don't know.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   What do you have, Kevin?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.960]   Do you have DSLR cable?
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.200]   I have cable mode at home, but it's terrible.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.600]   Do you have Delphia?
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   No, Comcast.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   Okay.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   And there's too many people in your neighborhood.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   In the afternoon.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   Yeah, there's too many people.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.200]   I'm going cable mode.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.560]   You like it?
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.720]   Robert you said you like it or you don't like it?
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.880]   I think it just cut off on him.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.640]   I just want to use cable.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   That's the cable mode.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   There's the answer right there.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   Well, personally, I mean it pretty much depends on the issue you like DSLR.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.840]   I'm going to have a three megabit line here.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.840]   So I've come here.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   No, I'm at work.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.480]   So Patrick, are you cable mode or DSLR?
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:20.720]   I'm DSLR because until I move to this house, I couldn't get a cable modem and the only
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.680]   cable modem provider I know of in San Francisco is Comcast and I won't give them any of my
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.440]   money for reasons I won't go into.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.320]   Hey, this is cool.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.520]   Nobody here works for Comcast now.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.520]   Nope.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.520]   Yay!
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.360]   So we can say anything we want because nobody can get fired.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.440]   Very true.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.760]   So Kevin, big roll out.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.960]   No, I'm not going to do anything.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.960]   Don't worry.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.160]   Big, big roll out for system last week.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.520]   You want to tell the world what happened?
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.600]   Oh, it was just madness.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.160]   I can't believe what happened.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.680]   There was how many people were in the chat room?
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.720]   We got up to 800 people in the IRC, but you couldn't do anything because we were being
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.280]   bought at the whole time.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   They finally locked it down.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.200]   We actually had, this was DSLXtreme who provides the chat room.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.080]   The guy's name is Andrew.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.520]   He's a handle of ecstatic.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:23.480]   He is one of their texts there and he is an EF net op and he knows what he's doing and
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.480]   he locked it down.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   He did a great job.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   However, I've never seen 800 people.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.880]   You know, it was like skiing.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.720]   The text goes by so fast.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.760]   You feel like it's like blurring.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.680]   You feel like you downhill skiing through text.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.040]   It was amazing.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.840]   I know you were having a party with a camera.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   Right.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.400]   So basically we had a little gift together.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.560]   There was probably about, I don't know, a Yoshua.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.520]   It was like 15 to 20 people, something like that.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.520]   Yeah, about that.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.920]   I mean, when we were there, there was over 800 people in the IRC and we were like, "Whoa!"
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.280]   All the websites were getting hammered.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.400]   The system actually went down.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.200]   The web server itself went down.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:10.600]   Luckily, we used a caching service from Prolexic and they were able to bring on multiple machines
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.000]   all over the place and kind of cache all of our content and seed our content so we stayed
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   up.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I saw that on your blog.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.720]   Had you made an arrangement with them ahead of time or did they come to your rescue like
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.320]   the fire brigade?
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:27.400]   Well, actually it happened right when we went down on Ron, who's kind of our tech guy.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.240]   The handles the server side of stuff made a call to our CEO, Jay, who is friends with
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.600]   the owner of Prolexic and they were able to accommodate us.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   They were really stoked.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.440]   It was crazy because the guys that set it up from Prolexic were like, "We're hosting
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   system?
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   That's awesome!"
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.480]   They were really stoked about it because they had heard about it themselves.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.480]   It was really cool.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.720]   They really helped us out.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.200]   So they're like an Akamai kind of.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   They do the caching.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.160]   Well, their main business, I guess, from what I understand is anti-denial service.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.160]   Ah.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.200]   If you're a Microsoft or Yahoo and someone's DDOS and you, they will basically spread
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.760]   the hit out and also use ways to filter out the bad packets.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:12.600]   The key at this point with DDOS is because of raw sockets, you can't really filter by
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.600]   IP address.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.160]   Even if you say it's a massively distributed denial of service attack where you have thousands
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.440]   of machines, even then it's only going to be thousands of IP addresses.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.280]   You can eventually lock it down by blocking those addresses.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.040]   But if they use raw sockets, every request, every SIN is a different IP address, you can't
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   block it.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   You can't lock it down.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.520]   So the only way to solve that is to throw a band with that.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.600]   They have somewhere around a thousand servers worldwide.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   That's what you need.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.600]   Spread it out.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.600]   Then you can throttle it.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.440]   Then you can also throttle it by saying, "No, if I get a SIN, just SIN is a request, "Okay,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.440]   I want the page.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.600]   You can't block SINs universally or your page is down."
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.040]   So what they do is they say, "Okay, the SIN flood, you only get the packet once from
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   that IP address.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.680]   Then that guy switches to a new IP address or maybe twice."
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   So the key on these is to say, "Oh, all right.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.840]   Well, I'm going to wait and make sure it's a real SIN.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.280]   So I'll wait until he resends because every normal browser will wait a little while and
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.280]   resend."
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.000]   So your site's slow, but it's up because you basically filter out the bad SINs.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.960]   But yeah, so that's what it takes a lot of bandwidth to do that.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.160]   Okay, I am from Rob.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.440]   He said he should be able to be back in.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.680]   He's on a different connection now.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.680]   All right.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.200]   So let me invite him back into the conference.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.080]   Of course, like I said, we've been hearing him on the recorder this whole time.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.240]   He's on the TwiKes.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.240]   You don't have to...
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   There we go.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.520]   I hope you weren't talking, Robert, because now I have to edit you out of the...
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.440]   I quality you.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.920]   I hope you swore to...
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:54.160]   Hey Leo, we just like, I ditched the ethernet and went to wireless and it seems to be working
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   better.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   So interesting.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.320]   Were you looking for information on Vario, Leo?
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   What happened?
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.320]   They got bought by Japan's IL-ECNTT.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   Oh, NTT Dokkama.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   I don't know if it's NTT Dokkama.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   Yeah, NTT Dokkama.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.960]   It's an telephone and telegraph.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   So NTT Communications Global IP Network.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.360]   You get swallowed by them.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.360]   You're swallowed.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.360]   Well, it's pretty scary.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.800]   So they bought more than 54 local regional, national, international providers.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.080]   Yeah, they were, I think, angling to be the big guy.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.560]   And then of course, a bigger...
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.560]   As they...
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   And to quote the episode...
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.560]   What is it?
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.400]   Episode two or episode one?
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.520]   There's always a bigger fish.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.080]   Except if you're NTT Dokkama, and there isn't a bigger fish.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.480]   They have 125,000 mile network of backbones.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.040]   It says, "Wow."
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   It's kind of insane.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.400]   Look at the global IP network.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.800]   And I'm counting lines across the Pacific.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   Let's see.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.760]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, like 18, I think.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.080]   15, something like that.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.440]   So we were talking about system bringing being just huge.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.320]   Do you know how many downloads you got, Kevin?
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.520]   It's hard to count.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.320]   We have the tracker through BitTorrent.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.760]   And according to BitTorrent, it's a little over 60,000.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.760]   That's great.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.480]   And we have all the...
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.720]   Obviously, all the mirrors that were set up and posted.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.680]   And how big is the file?
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.760]   It ranges depending on you want lower high quality, but in between 50 to 150 megabytes.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.720]   So 60,000 times, let's say 100 megabytes, is six terabytes.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.720]   Is that right?
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.200]   Yeah, six terabytes.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   That's a lot of data.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.400]   Holy moly.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.640]   Chimony Christmas.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.640]   Good golly.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.600]   That's crazy.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.440]   Holy megabytes, Batman.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.440]   Have you seen anybody see the new Batman?
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   Batman begins or whatever it is.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.120]   It comes out the middle of the month.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   Everybody's getting excited.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   They say it's good.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.680]   Well, that ten minute preview they showed at the end of Smallville, the season finale,
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   it was awesome looking.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   I cannot wait.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.000]   That designs me far more than Star Wars, dude.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.560]   Well, we've had some bad, bad mans though.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.560]   Oh, definitely.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.360]   But this is the origin of Batman, starting from when his parents die on up through his
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.920]   training to become Batman.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.960]   Yeah, yeah, maybe they only showed the best ten minutes.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.760]   Oh, God, I really want to see it.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.720]   I have actually seen the models for the cars that they used to the movies.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   They had the cars that you've seen.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   The car was seen.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.360]   And I didn't know Batman was a ninja.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.160]   I don't know what you think.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.840]   He had to learn that somewhere.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   That's true.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.960]   But I didn't realize he did ninja training.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.440]   The Cape Crusader he is.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.880]   Hey, just remember, namchucks don't kill people.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.800]   Ninjas do.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   I've stolen it.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.880]   I should give credit to that.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.440]   That is a company.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.360]   I met this guy in Rockville, Maryland.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.840]   He has a company.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.080]   This is his t-shirt that he had.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   He was wearing.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.720]   It's called, oh, it's naked.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   Oh, shoot.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.560]   Now I feel bad because I owe him a plug.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   I just stole his best line.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.560]   Naked.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   I'll put a link in the show.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.560]   That's naked.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.800]   I just lost his business card.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.640]   Where is it?
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.800]   So okay, I'm sorry to keep coming back to the system, but I feel like I really want
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.240]   to hear the whole story.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.040]   So were you didodost?
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   No.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   No, no.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.080]   It was just the downloads and the sheer number of people that were trying to access the
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.360]   site at once.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.320]   The funny thing about it though is that the main problem that we had with the server hitting
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.800]   its peak flowed was not the sheer number of users, but it was just the fact that people
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   were signing up for the newsletter.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.320]   And it was sending out so many people were signing up for the newsletter.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.160]   It was sending out the newsletter confirmations and actually brought our server.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.760]   We had a pretty crappy server at the time, but now we're much better.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.400]   And Kevin Rose.com is down right now.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   You went back to TypePad?
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   Right.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.400]   I went back to TypePad.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.400]   And are you happy?
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.400]   I'm very extremely happy.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.880]   I actually chatted with one of the guys there.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.880]   I think he's there.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.360]   The CTO or I can't remember his exact title there, but I told them some of the problems
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.680]   I was having as far as the site going down because of too much traffic.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.880]   And they, it seems like they've really built out a great backbone and a great network at
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   TypePad.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   That's me.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   I haven't had an issue ever since I moved over there.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.880]   So.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.240]   I mean, that's a really nice success to me.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.160]   It was just this young couple, Ben and Mina.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.120]   And they, you know, he's a pro programmer.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:12.160]   He wrote this thing and they've really built a business around it, which is kind of neat.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.400]   Something I'll never be able to do because I don't have a head for that stuff.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.040]   But it looks like you're doing it, Kevin.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   Yeah, we're trying to.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   I mean, we've put together a really good team and we're excited about Crankian as many
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.440]   episodes as we possibly can.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.520]   How was your last day at G4?
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   Was it sad?
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.840]   It was a little bit.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.640]   I mean, I've become friends with a lot of the people there.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.880]   The guy's an attack of the show.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.440]   It's just a great group of people.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   And.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   Who's left now?
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   Sarah's still there.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440]   Gregor.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   Joshua Brantano.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.440]   Joshua Brantano.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.280]   I, Brinny Moran, but he never really worked with us.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.880]   Ryan Vance came back.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   That was wild.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.840]   He used the, he was a guy who really put X play on the map.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   Right.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.080]   And he left and then he came back and I think, what he's like a vice president now or something.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.880]   Yeah, he's pretty high up now.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.640]   So let me tell you about this blackmail story because I think this is kind of whack.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.160]   And I don't know if it's a true, I don't know how widespread it is.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.640]   We just won security company claims they've discovered this.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.200]   It takes advantage of a whole since patched, but you know, most people still haven't patched
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:19.280]   windows that allows you to, to, a website to run arbitrary code on the computer of the
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.920]   guy who visits the site.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.960]   So if you go there with an unpatched computer, they run, what they run is PGP and they encrypt
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.280]   your document files with their password, right?
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.120]   And they leave a note in your hard drive saying, you want to get out of these sites.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.200]   These files, it will be 200 bucks.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.240]   That's awesome.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   That is really clever.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   That's just funny.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.680]   What's funny is that's not one million.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.480]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.160]   But Yoshi brought up a good point.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.560]   He said, well, can't we just track the payment?
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.920]   I mean, maybe there, maybe you have to pay somebody in Russia or something and they can't
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   catch it.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.360]   Well, bank records can be tracked all over the world now.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.640]   I mean, if you call the feds and say I'm being blackmailed over the internet, then if they
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.720]   actually do investigate it, they're going to just get the routing numbers and go know
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.440]   exactly what account it went into.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:17.360]   Yeah, but if you move fast enough, well, all of these, basically all of these hacks require
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.360]   that, right?
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.480]   You get as like even the phishing scams, you get as much as you can for the 24 hours,
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.840]   you can keep the site up and then you move because they block these sites as soon as
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.840]   people notice them.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.880]   I've been getting a lot of phishing mail from eBay lately.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.880]   Yeah, one right now.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.760]   Have you guys been getting a lot of Russian spam?
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.760]   A lot of what?
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.480]   A lot of Russian spam?
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.360]   No, but I do get a lot of emails from young Russian women who are looking to meet a good-looking
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.360]   guy like me.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.160]   I can try that out?
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   No.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.760]   See, I get an email that say I need to take the hair, you know, restoration drugs and then
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.040]   I'll meet the young Russian women.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.280]   Then they'll send me the young Russian women spam.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.080]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.880]   First, you've got to take the Viagra and the Rogaine.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.880]   That's the key.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.280]   Did you hear about the Viagra's blinding people?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.080]   Yeah, do you think that's true?
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   I don't know.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   I don't know.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.360]   You'll go blind if you do that.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.360]   Oh, it's true.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.720]   Your mom was right.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.320]   Especially for all the people that are taking it recreationally.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.840]   It's like, uh...
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   Well, why is it any worse?
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.040]   If you need it or you don't need it, you're still...
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   You're still blowing that such a popular...
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.040]   Oh, that's such a great thing.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   Take the recreational way.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   Take a lot of people take it.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   Come on.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.520]   You don't need to because you're young and virile.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.800]   But I think a lot of people take it.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   We hope.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   If you're not, we don't want to know.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.120]   I don't want to know either way.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.480]   But I think that's very common.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.120]   I mean, that's why you're buying on the internet, right?
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.600]   I mean, why else?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   For fun.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.520]   I thought you meant like he's hanging out with some friends.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   Oh, no, no.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.520]   I'm a little strange.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.320]   That would be very little strange.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.280]   Excuse me, guys, I'm a little...
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   I got to move here.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.280]   I'm like, I'm cool.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   I can't stand up.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   I can't move.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:03.320]   So, does this qualify as the G-rated version of the show?
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.400]   This is our last gasp because as soon as we get on that big layer, we can't be...
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   We have to...
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.880]   No blue material.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.480]   You know who invested in Sea Alice?
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.720]   You know, Sea Alice is one of the competitors for Viagra.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   Oh, Bill Gates?
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   Can you hear him?
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   Bill Gates.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.720]   Really?
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   Bill Gates was a prime...
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.440]   I think with prime investor in that.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.360]   And then they sold it to the pharmaceutical company that sells it now.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   But he funded the company that came up with it.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.160]   Let's talk about BitTorrent.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.080]   It's a big, no, it's a trackless BitTorrent.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.880]   Are you going to keep using BitTorrent for a system, Ken?
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.280]   Yeah, it just makes the most sense right now.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.160]   Of course, it's the easiest way to get to it.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.360]   But the problem is it's not...
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.000]   I mean, it's easiest in the sense that you can get it because there's a lot of seeds
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.240]   and it's very fast, not initially.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.920]   But once there's 10 or 20 seeds out there, it comes in pretty quick.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.920]   The problem is it's...
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.520]   I think a lot of people don't know how to use BitTorrent.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.240]   It's not exactly easy to use.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   We all use Azurias.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.760]   Is everybody using Azurias here?
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   It seems awfully quick.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.480]   That's all I have to say, once it's going.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.920]   Yeah, well once there's enough seeds, you're pulling at your maximum speed, I think, if
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.400]   there's enough seeds out there.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.840]   I think a bit of use in the news BitTorrent search engine.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.840]   Well, that's what they're doing.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.080]   It's called Trackerless Search.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.680]   That's the problem with BitTorrent.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.360]   The reason it's possible for the Motion Picture Association of America to go after the BitTorrent
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:33.680]   sites, the supernovas and the TV torrents and all that is because there's a tracker.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.320]   No slowdown in tracker sites, if anything, they're more than ever.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.840]   There really is some question.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.280]   These guys don't stay up because who can fight deep pockets?
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.240]   You can't afford to fight it.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.040]   But the tracker sites aren't hosting any content.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.720]   I mean, there's nothing illegal on the tracker site.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.280]   It's just putting people together.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.600]   Didn't 2600 give them to a long and extended legal battle about pointing links?
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   That's right.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   But did they lose or win?
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   It took so long.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.800]   I think they won that case.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   Did they not?
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   I think you're allowed to link to...
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.440]   They linked to DCSS, the decryption tool.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.400]   Well even if they lost in court, and I don't know, I'll have to do some research, but even
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.760]   if they lost in court, they certainly won morally because DCSS is everywhere.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.560]   It's going to be interesting to see what happens because now that we're seeing tracklers,
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.880]   because when it was tracked, they were still kind of responsible because they were actually
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.720]   operating the tracking servers.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.080]   So there's somebody you can go after.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.080]   Completely trackless.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.760]   There's no central point of...
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   Well you could still...
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:40.480]   I mean if you look, if you're looking for Star Wars and you start downloading Star Wars,
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.800]   you can see the IP address the guy you're getting it from, right?
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   Right.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.600]   Everyone that's even in there, you can just use torrents by and drag and drop it inside
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.680]   that app that'll show everyone's IP address.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.400]   And I mean that's identifying them.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.600]   But that's even been addressed now.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.920]   I mean on a slash dot this morning, there was a new bit torrent replacement quote unquote
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.320]   called Rodey, which is written in Java and it actually includes full of nominidity.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:07.040]   So you can basically use a third party to block your IP address and there's no way to
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.480]   figure out who's doing what.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.360]   And it works really well with...
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.800]   Well, what were they saying?
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.880]   If A wants to get a file from B, I'm quoting this right off the page right now, and they
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.760]   get C to agree to stand in on the exchange.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.760]   B gets C's IP address not A's.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.120]   So it's easy to get a third party.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.360]   If you could also...
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.360]   I'll give you...
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.720]   There are tools out there to anonymize you.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.160]   I'm actually getting one to review and I'll let you know how it works as a product called
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:39.400]   iPhandom that is very slick, which gives you full anonymity.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.680]   This is a little box.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.720]   You would put it outside your router.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.640]   It's not a gnat.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.680]   It's not doing gnat.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.640]   It filters all your traffic through their servers and their servers look for viruses
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.760]   spy where they completely protect you.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.560]   But also because you're going through their servers, it's an effect of proxy.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.000]   It's not a proxy, but it works like an anonymizing proxy.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.440]   Nobody can see your IP address.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440]   And this is iPhandom?
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.600]   It's called iPhandom.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.280]   They're sending me one because it sounds really cool.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:18.160]   The guys who did it have a really good track record in this area.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.800]   I think it might be a big business.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.720]   It's a very intriguing product.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.040]   It sounds like anonymizer.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.560]   Why do you have to have the hardware box?
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.320]   So why can't you just do all that in software?
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.520]   Well, anonymizer is a proxy server.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.520]   It's proxying.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.480]   So it hides you by filtering you through a lot of different servers.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.680]   A couple of disadvantages, of course, is slower because you go through a bunch of different
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.680]   servers.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:43.480]   But what this does in addition to that, it provides firewalling and antivirus and anti-spyware.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.600]   Because they're looking at all the traffic that's going through and they're stopping.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.320]   If you have an email with a virus attached, they remove the virus and then they pass along
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.000]   the email to you.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.520]   So it's much more it's anonymizer plus.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.520]   Although they're really the anonymizing isn't the key to this whole thing.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.000]   It's a side effect.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.880]   But and I asked them this specifically.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   Do you work with BitTorrent?
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   Yep, pass it right through.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.360]   It's like a hardware version of the zero knowledge stuff that they use.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.360]   It's kind of like that.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   But again, it's not a proxy.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   It's doing something a little bit different.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.960]   Do they keep log files so they could be seen in it?
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.760]   I mean, anonymizer, I know for a fact they don't keep email log files.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   Right.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   I'll just toss them right out.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.200]   Because otherwise, Interpol or a police agency could say, well, who was using this
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.880]   IP address at this time?
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:33.280]   In fact, that happened, of course, with remember those anonymous proxies, email proxies.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   The email one of the emailers.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.840]   Yeah, and one of them, I can't read the big one.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.840]   Was it anonymous?
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840]   Not five.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.560]   Yeah, and your poll came to and said, you know, give us the names and they did.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.760]   But yeah, so that's a good question.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.160]   I'll have to ask them.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:53.720]   Because their business is not anonymizing, does anonymizer work with BitTorrent?
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   That's a good question.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.440]   I know it encrypts and handles everything as far as HTTP requests.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.680]   Yeah, I bet it doesn't.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.240]   In fact, I know you can have I've had some difficult I'll have to turn off anonymizer.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.560]   And it's things like editing wikis and stuff because it's, it's, it, it, it, you know,
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   messes things up.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.800]   In fact, the Google cache did the same thing.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.640]   Oh, that was a disaster.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.640]   Yeah, that didn't work too well, did it?
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.480]   They pulled the plug on that very rapidly.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.200]   You know, you got to credit them.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   They try stuff.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.320]   If it doesn't work, they say, well, move on.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.520]   You can't have a thousand hits.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.560]   I mean, 90% of what they do is great.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.720]   So you got to, you got to give them some credit.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.880]   I have, Leo, I have a, and everyone else have a guest here.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.520]   I want you to talk to you.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.680]   He's sitting right next to me, Mr. Dan Heward.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.680]   Yeah!
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.680]   It's Fufu.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.680]   Hey, Dan.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.120]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   Wow.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   How you doing, Dan?
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   You're working on system full time?
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.160]   Yeah, if you're so, yeah.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   That's what the boss tells me.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.280]   You getting a paycheck?
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   I think so.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.880]   It's checks in the mail, isn't it?
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   It's so great to talk to you.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.040]   You know, on Mother's Day, we've been trying to get you on for a while.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.520]   And in fact, you have an email address, believe it or not, Dan.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.480]   It's Dan@thisweekintech.com.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.360]   But on Mother's Day, I saw you come on IM.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   So I started typing it.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.360]   It was your mom.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.520]   Oh, yeah, my mom.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.520]   She came on.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520]   That's right.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520]   She's humming us about that.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.520]   Very sweet.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   I had a lovely conversation.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.760]   What'd you guys talk about?
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   [laughter]
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.080]   You, of course.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.080]   What else would we talk about?
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.400]   I'm just kidding.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.480]   So how's things going?
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.680]   Are you having fun?
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.520]   It's actually the time of our lives.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:45.600]   When we lived up in San Francisco, for me specifically, it was one of my best times
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   growing up.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   And we're, you know, there's a good chance that we're going up there again.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.440]   And we're just going to re-experience that and do something that we love at the same
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.440]   time.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.440]   Are you coming back up here?
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.440]   Yeah, we think so.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.640]   Oh, dudes, that would be great.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.960]   Yeah, then we can get together and do some video content.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.480]   We could do it live, and that means we could do video.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   That's right.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.960]   I just got the bomb away.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   I'm excited.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.520]   Yoshi, you'll be the last one down there.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.520]   You've got to come back.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.000]   Time to come back up, Yoshi.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.960]   Yeah, well, I may have just had an offer that's not going to enable me to come back.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   Oh, can we talk about that?
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.560]   Or is that still up in the air?
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.520]   It's still up in the air, but I mean, I can talk about it.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.760]   It's a special effects company that does 3D scans and stuff that's so cool.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.240]   It has offered me a position.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   I just have to sign the final paperwork possibly tomorrow.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.720]   So excited for you.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   It's really exciting.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.560]   It sounds like the job for you.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.240]   Well, for me, growing up playing with all these toys and being a Star Wars junkie and
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.920]   all this kind of stuff now, it's like, OK, cool.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.920]   I get to make them.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.440]   What are you going to be doing?
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.440]   You're making models?
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.600]   Well, they do like the 3D scans for all the movies, like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.320]   all those they've done.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.280]   And when they parse sometimes for movies, for visual effects, but also for the toys and
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.760]   models and the muckets and that kind of thing, and I will be running all of their technology,
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.120]   all their computers, all their scanners, all their rapid prototyping machines.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.320]   Dude, we want to hit action figures.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.640]   I'm not kidding, dude.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.760]   I'm not even that sounds awesome.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.760]   What do you think guys?
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.400]   Because I'm going to have to learn how to use all this stuff.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   That's right.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.320]   I want an action figure.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.240]   Think he said that they will sell merchandise.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.880]   I know we have this Jinx hack where also Kevin, I don't not stepping on Jinx, but we've had
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:32.720]   a relationship with Think Geek for ages and ages two, and they want to do some merchandising.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.360]   Jinx just does T-shirts, right?
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   What's that?
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.360]   Jinx hack where it just does T-shirts, right?
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.280]   Yeah, they do T-shirts.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.880]   So we'll give Jinx the T-shirt concession, but I want action figures and we'll get Think
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.640]   Geek to sell those, OK?
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   Sounds good.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.640]   Yoshi, you can have a lightsaber on your action figure.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.720]   Just wanted a samurai sword.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   OK.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   I want Kung Fu grip.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.760]   OK, Fufu's Kung Fu grip.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.760]   Try and say that three times.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.760]   Fufu's Kung Fu grip.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   I will call it the Kung Fu grip.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   I want the swing that comes off my back.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   My name is Dan.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   Dan doesn't like Fufu.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.960]   You can't call him that anymore.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.040]   It's too late, dude.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.200]   You are Fufu.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.960]   You are the Fufu.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.800]   Just accept that one.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.480]   And there's so many worst nicknames you could have.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   It's true.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.000]   Like the dark tipper or something like that.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Poor guy.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.760]   So, again, will you be card-- that's too bad because I was thinking for the action figure,
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.840]   Kevin, a big D on your chest.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   I'm good, thanks.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.360]   I'll be the blind guy with no hair.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360]   No.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.280]   No way.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.360]   You have the badger-like pelt of luxurious hair.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   Exactly.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.560]   And Pat will have to have his sledgehammer.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.840]   Hey, this is exciting.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.840]   And a car.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.680]   You've got to have a car, Patrick.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.360]   You've got to have a Camaro or something.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   No Camaras.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.200]   How about an old boss?
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   I love this.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.560]   So, what do we do with Robert?
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   Robert can have the-- I know.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.880]   Robert's like in a lab coat.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.120]   And his hair could be sticking straight up.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.240]   Seriously.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.520]   That and the string coming out of my back, you can pull.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.960]   And I'll say something either--
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.360]   Dad, I'm going to lose that thought, real quick.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.360]   Yeah, lose that.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.960]   No more string out of his back.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.480]   But you can have a little cigarette dangling from your lips, OK?
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.920]   That's true.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.040]   To remind me of the habit I should stop, beginner.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.600]   Yes.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.720]   The most well-engineered legal drug in the country.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.240]   It is.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.360]   It's a perfect delivery mechanism.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.440]   Boys and girls, remember that Robert Herod's addiction
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.400]   to cigarettes is not an endorsement on the half of a twit
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.840]   for cigarette usage.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.760]   Send your unused cartons, too.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.160]   For the health insurance--
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.520]   It's so hard to smoke in California now, because you just
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.280]   can't-- you have to not only go outside the building,
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.640]   you now have to walk like 100 feet away.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.600]   So it's getting-- nobody smokes around here as much.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.920]   You must be hanging out in really nice places
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.640]   unlike the rest of us.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.880]   Well, I was going to say, when you go to Canada,
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.000]   everybody smokes in Toronto.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.200]   It's the weirdest thing.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.160]   Well, you go to most states in America, everybody smokes.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.240]   It was strangest for me, I think, in New York and Chicago.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.040]   Watching the-- we had it-- I think it affected us out here
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.240]   in California first.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   Were the restaurants you couldn't smoke in a restaurant?
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.240]   Or-- I mean, restaurants in bars?
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.040]   That was going to be a bar when you couldn't smoke in a bar.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.760]   The minute I saw that kick in New York in particular Chicago,
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.160]   it was amazing.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.560]   Do you see the writing on the wall?
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.480]   I never thought it would happen.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.800]   Vegas will be the holdout, though.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.600]   You can smoke anywhere in Vegas, baby.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   You can smoke or drink anywhere in that town.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.160]   So big--
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:49.960]   There's-- I need another--
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.640]   --from Microsoft.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.880]   Big Longhorn-- are you ready?
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.920]   The Big Longhorn announcement, right?
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.480]   They took out the file system.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.320]   They've taken out anything good that was-- but they-- but--
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.240]   they do have a new feature you're going to love in Longhorn.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.760]   No more my.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.160]   It's no more my music, my pictures, my folders,
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.560]   my network, none of that.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:08.840]   My documents.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.320]   It's not computer.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.520]   It's just going to be documents.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.120]   Music, pictures, no more my.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.120]   Amazing.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   Wow.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   Made the point right there.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.520]   And sure, that's awesome.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.920]   And how many years is this going to push back development?
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.840]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.560]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.800]   By the way, it just picked up six months of development.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.200]   2007, yeah, sorry.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.520]   But no my.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.760]   It's going to be worth it.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.360]   You want to--
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.120]   If it wasn't for gaming, I would just
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.640]   dump the Windows platform and move everything over to Linux.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.600]   Buy an Xbox.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.440]   Buy a PlayStation 3.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.640]   They're going to be better gaming.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.640]   PC gaming stays ahead of that curve better than you just can't beat it.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   I guess.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   I love console gaming.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.160]   What's your favorite game right now, Robert?
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   What are you playing?
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.440]   For my PC, actually, I've been getting back to some real-time strategy stuff like roller
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.440]   coaster tycoon.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.440]   Come on.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.440]   Yeah, that's all quick.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   PC gaming.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.760]   No, but I also fight for roller coaster tycoon.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.840]   I'd be using a Linux right now.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:13.080]   No, those are some-- once you build up a sizable amusement park, that actually becomes a pretty
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.080]   challenging game.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.080]   You like suit tycoon?
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.960]   I'm glad you couldn't say that with a straight face, Robert.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.520]   But what was the other one?
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.480]   Some Empire Earth 2 was another one.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.480]   Somebody just gave me.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   No, I'll be honest.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.680]   I still am playing Rise of Nations.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   I like that stuff.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   That's a great game, too.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.560]   And I actually loaded up Far Cry again.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.920]   I'm going back through that.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.920]   You know, that's one of those games.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.720]   It was a beautiful game, but it took like a few hours to finish.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.480]   Oh, definitely.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.320]   I've been trying to do it on Realistic, which is the hardest setting.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   It's darn hard.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.320]   That's all I have to say.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   It's a challenge.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   It's a challenge.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.160]   But that game-- I still say that game has the best AI of all first person shooters within
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   the last in all of history.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.800]   I haven't seen a first person shooter with a better AI system than Far Cry.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.560]   You play games, Howard?
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   How-- Howard?
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   Howard?
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.560]   Who?
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.560]   Who?
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.160]   That and my Counter Strike addiction.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.560]   Oh, you still play Counter Strike?
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.840]   Oh, Counter Strike Source is just fun.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.000]   They've been adding a lot of new maps, too, lately, which, you know, mix it up a little
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   bit.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.720]   They've been revisiting a lot of classic maps from the original Counter Strike and doing
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.360]   them with the new engine to, you know, pretty them up.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   I've--
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.760]   Still-- it's a good team game.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.760]   It's exciting.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.840]   Co-op team games are my favorite.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.360]   Bar none.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.240]   It's kind of an underground business, but there's a lot of them.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.000]   And they're big in San Francisco.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.040]   All the kids going after high school-- after schools out, and they all go into these internet
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.960]   gaming parlors, and they're all playing Counter Strike against each other.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   I don't know.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.080]   There's a lot of them, at least three of them, that were within a couple miles of my neighborhood
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.080]   of all shut down.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:53.640]   Well, maybe they're coming after the suburbs now, because there's a bunch-- I was driving
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:44:00.440]   behind a big old pickup truck that said, "You frag him on his license plate."
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:06.160]   Just follow him to the gaming center.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.080]   We didn't really get to talk about this last week, so let's talk about this week.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.880]   Pentium D, the dual-core Pentium, going to the desktop.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.240]   Intel says it's going to sell a million of them by the end of the year.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.640]   It's the end of the line for single-core processors.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.600]   Then there's almost a performance improvement if you use a couple of obscure benchmarks
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.240]   that it's expensive, yet difficult.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   I don't know.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.520]   It's the benchmarks I've seen so far.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:36.200]   Robert, you've probably been following this closer than I have, but I'm not seeing much
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:42.160]   that doesn't make me want to go for a much less expensive, you know, F1 64 compared to
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.160]   the Pentium D.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.360]   I was going to say Intel who?
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.680]   Is Intel in trouble?
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:52.760]   Is it-- I mean, for desktop CPUs, it's losing favor with the hardcore group, definitely.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:58.040]   With AMD's X2 coming up, that is the most powerful processor you can buy for everything.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.600]   Is that a dual-core 64?
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   What is that?
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.240]   Yeah, dual-core.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   That's coming up.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.240]   Let's see.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.600]   Actually, I think you can purchase them right now.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.720]   Let me see, over at Monarch, actually, I thought I had a couple of them.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.880]   I'll take a quick peek.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.240]   But anyway, all our performance numbers for every-- for video encoding, audio encoding,
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.000]   gaming, everything just puts that chip at the forefront.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   And that, you don't have to have a 64-bit OS.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   No.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.800]   And there's no reason to have a 64-bit OS right now for 99.9% of everyone out there.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.240]   Well, there's lots of reasons not to.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.240]   Like, nothing works.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.080]   Yeah, well, there's just no benefit yet.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.680]   It's the big thing.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.680]   No significant benefit.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   I don't know if there's a real bit of a bunch of guys that are--
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   I think there's really huge statistical database packages who are like, "Yes, there is."
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.680]   Sorry.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.200]   I need four terabytes of memory.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   And there are people who actually do--
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   I think that's one of the ways--
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   I think it's one of the ways--
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   Intel went wrong, though, right?
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.000]   Is it saying, "Well, we're going to put all our efforts into 64-bit code."
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.600]   And AMB said, "No, x86 has lots of legs."
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   And they stuck with it.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   I don't know.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.080]   Intel still owns what percentage of the market?
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.560]   That's because of companies like Dell.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.640]   Do even Dell's looking at AMD now, though.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   That would be--
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.480]   Intel still has their integrated graphics, too.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.720]   Would that be the bellwether if Dell suddenly says, "Yeah, we're going to do AMD?"
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:13.000]   Well, I think people still, you know, the vast buying majority and certainly IT community.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.400]   Like, the IT community in general are all about Intel.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.400]   Well, they'll see.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   Well, they'll see.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   AnyMM.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   I mean, this type of--
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.880]   I mean, that's the best laptop chip still, yes?
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.880]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.880]   The penny.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.880]   I mean, unless AMB's-- you know, I love the--
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.880]   We don't know about the Tourion yet.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.480]   We haven't seen benchmarks yet.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.360]   Well, I love the Veritek notebook I have, except for the fact that it doesn't have a
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.680]   penny embedded in it.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:41.120]   And the new ones, they actually switched them from the AMD Athlon XPs over to Celeron
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   and M's or Celeron.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.240]   Veritek, a second tier company, but they're making good products for very low prices.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.880]   So some complaints about quality control, maybe they don't last as long as the other
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.880]   guys is that?
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.680]   Well, I've already had to-- I've had to-- this is the first notebook I've ever had to ship
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.280]   back inside the first six or seven months for repairs.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.960]   The power supply plug came loose inside the case.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.960]   I've heard numerous complaints about that, actually.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.360]   The case itself, the plastic molding, was bent a little bit, so it scrapes against the
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.360]   screen.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.120]   And there's nothing I can do about that.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:20.040]   The keyboard's warped from the heat of the unit, so it's got a really interesting shape
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   to it.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:28.440]   But it was also-- it was $800, $850 after rebate with a half a gig of RAM, a decent processor,
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.440]   12 inch screen.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.240]   It's the ultra portable version on board 802.11G.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.400]   And I mean, when it came back to the melting keyboard thing--
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.280]   Yeah, well, it's funny.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.000]   It's most of the keyboard manufacturers for notebooks.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   I mean, because it was funny, I've told you guys I've been gutting my house and throwing
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.960]   away all the old stuff.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.760]   And that box of crap has going to have some amazing stuff in it, if we ever decide to
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   give it away.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:58.840]   But I had to have this notebook I've been saving for forever, which is one of the original
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.440]   Dell latitudes.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.280]   And it's got a track ball in it.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.080]   And the keyboard is amazing, you know?
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.120]   But the notebook's like three inches thick.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.160]   But the action on that keyboard is still the closest thing to that is the keyboards they
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.400]   use in the IBM ThinkPads, even those are, you know, just because they have to go so thin
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   on the Z on these.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.480]   If they don't spend money on the keyboards, they just fall apart.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.080]   Another reason I'm buying my IBM's-- I love IBM's notebook keyboards.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.040]   I'm nervous about the Lenovo takeover on IBM, though.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.840]   Yeah, I mean, that's the Chinese government.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.560]   Speaking of governments, look what the-- did you see what the MPAA announced today?
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.960]   The Motion Picture Association of America said they're putting up 10 surveillance cameras
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.360]   on the streets of LA to catch DVD pirates.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.760]   Can a private group put up surveillance cameras on the street?
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   Sure.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.480]   There are more surveillance cameras in the United States, like per square mile to any
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.720]   other country in the world, Leo.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.720]   I mean, you're walking down a--
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   Yeah, but they're usually put up by the city.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.720]   No, they're not.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.120]   They're put up by building owners, they're put up by corporations.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.320]   This is on the streets of LA.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   What do you think happens?
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.600]   Go walk around downtown San Francisco.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.800]   There's buildings and watch the exits in every corner.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.720]   What's going to be interesting is like, yeah, if they are working with the city.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   They have to work.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.720]   They are the city.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.320]   They're going to post the city police are monitoring the cameras.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.360]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.960]   My last trip to Europe when I was in Italy, every building on every corner had at least
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.960]   two cameras.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   They were everywhere.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:31.680]   So if it makes it easier for law enforcement, yeah, there is the whole big brother issue.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.800]   You could monitor with your new little device that you showed on system, you could monitor
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.320]   those cameras, seal the signal.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.800]   Now let me ask you this.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   So that's what you built on the first episode of System, a device to monitor video cameras.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.280]   Could you reverse that?
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.040]   And this is very eye spy and make it send a signal to the camera or intercept a signal
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.240]   and send a different signal.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.240]   Right.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.680]   You actually have to broadcast-- At that frequency.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:58.200]   At that frequency and the same signal to act over-- I know what you're saying.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.480]   You're saying so that whoever's watching the security monitor, you could replace their
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   signal.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   You could put the footsteps up or something.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   In theory.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   And all you have to do is--
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   Talked about it on your video.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.200]   All you have to do is basically boost it.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.400]   You get a camera that's transmitting the signal and put a booster on it and just overpower
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.400]   the heck out of it.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.800]   And anything that they have isn't going to be able to keep up with the power of that
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   signal.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   You're sending out.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.440]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.840]   That's a very candid camera.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.720]   That's kind of a 21st century punked.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.040]   You watch the guard go crazy because all of a sudden, you know, something else is on there.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.400]   Well, what does that FCC rule?
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:35.460]   It says all electronic devices have to accept some form of interference or any form of
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.460]   interference.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:40.280]   Well, and they're on unregulated-- I mean, that's what you're talking about from the
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.480]   shadows box three is that this is unregulated frequency, right?
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.480]   So that you can do anything you want.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   Well, pretty much.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.640]   I mean, according to FCC, though, you can't increase your-- it's like when we were trying
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.480]   to modify some antennas on air on, you know, back at G4 and they wouldn't let us.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.120]   You can't increase the broadcast power, if you're on a certain amount.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.080]   And that's actually illegal to do that.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.080]   There's a maximum.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.080]   And it's illegal.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.320]   It's also illegal to use any non-certified antenna, which is why they all had different
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.580]   pigtail connectors.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:11.580]   I think our biggest issue, though, for that TV broadcast thing was the fact that it was
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:16.460]   a radio-- radio television, but we were interrupting signals, potentially interrupting signals that
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.820]   were being used for commercial purposes.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.500]   So it wasn't an unlicensed chunk of bandwidth.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:29.220]   How long before someone hacks the MPAA cameras and maybe puts Star Wars Episode 3 on the
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.220]   camera?
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.220]   You know what?
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.220]   It's amazing.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:37.280]   Somebody's just going to walk up and just smash the front of them with a hammer, put
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.460]   their blanket down and start selling their pirated videos.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:47.840]   This is from the group that said that the VCR was to the American public as the Boston
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.920]   stranglers to the woman home alone.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.340]   And who's the real threat here?
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.680]   The Motion Picture Association of America, folks.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   Not the VCR.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   Jeez.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.200]   Well, I wonder why-- I mean, is it even possible to know how much money they actually
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.200]   lose worldwide to piracy?
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.960]   I mean, I understand them wanting to protect it, but it's kind of funny because they're
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.080]   always doing really nickel and dime things because maybe the only place they can do them
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.560]   is inside the US.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.240]   Well, how much money are they spending trying to enforce all this stuff?
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.400]   Well, all the lawyers are already on retainer.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:26.080]   I wish they would just simply put that effort into creating more formats for us at better
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.440]   quality and cheaper prices.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.560]   And I think the problem would solve itself.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:34.080]   Guys, I think we are running out of time.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.480]   Any final thoughts from anybody?
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.320]   Any plugs anybody wants to get in?
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.800]   Did you guys talk about Star Wars?
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.960]   Did you guys all see it last week?
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:40.960]   I missed it.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   I was out.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:42.960]   You were a little busy.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.640]   Yeah, I was a little disappointed.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.200]   I want to see it again.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.800]   It was a lot better than the last two.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.600]   Oh, definitely.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:57.720]   I just would have liked to have seen the emergence of the dark Darth, the mass Darth Vader a
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   lot sooner in the movie.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.160]   Yeah, that's what we all want to see him.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.360]   Forget Princess Amad Dallas.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.680]   Who cares about her?
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.000]   I think the love scenes with the princess.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.600]   The biggest disappointments.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.440]   Well, they just snuffed her character.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.840]   It was kind of like what they did to Jar Jar in episode two.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.480]   For people to this twisted housewife and it just...
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.640]   Yeah, it was like a Henry James novel without the good writing or the plot and character
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   development.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.880]   It just mirrors it kind of freaky out that Luke and Leia are twins.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.720]   I mean, is that kind of freaky?
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.320]   That just creeps me out.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.320]   I don't know.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.200]   Because one has brown hair and one has yellow hair and they don't look like...
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.240]   They were this love interest in the beginning and it's like, "Ooh, I don't know."
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:41.000]   Well, that's where Han steps in and goes, "Oh, sister, cool."
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.200]   Hey, yeah.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.400]   You're getting a cute sister, man.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:50.760]   You just got to treat a Jedi sister at her, you know, home mess you up.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.640]   And your mama's pretty cute, too.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.400]   Even if she's a Yale graduate.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.200]   La la la la la la la la la.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.200]   How about Jedi?
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.040]   Well, yeah, right?
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.040]   I mean...
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.040]   I don't know.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   Well, that would happen.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   Are there female Jedi masters?
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.040]   Is there a one that comes out?
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.040]   Are there female Jedi masters?
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.040]   Yes, there were female Jedi masters.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.040]   Who?
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   Were there?
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.840]   I thought there were in episode two.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.760]   Yeah, there were some in episode three, yeah.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.880]   That or there were Jedi's in drag.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.560]   Well, they all were skirts.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.880]   It's kind of hard to tell.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.680]   I never did a thrower.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.040]   Sorry, that was playing in San Francisco.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.040]   All right.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.720]   Thanks, Leo, for inviting me up.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.840]   I just want to tell you, for inviting me up to Canada, that was a lot of fun.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.000]   Call for help was great.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.560]   Yeah, in fact, watch Call for help because he'll be on it soon, I think.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.360]   I can't remember when those shows air, but yeah.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:45.840]   Showing us how he does system and the little worst buying device that you made, that'll
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   be fun.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.040]   And are you going to come back at some point?
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.040]   What's that, Leo?
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.040]   You're going to come back?
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.040]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.040]   If you'll have me back.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.040]   Anytime.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.040]   In fact, standing offered all of you.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.040]   Any girl?
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.040]   The time you're in the mood of Toronto.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.040]   I can't pay your way.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.280]   I'll buy you dinner, but that's all I can do.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.720]   But anytime you want to come to Toronto, you're welcome.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.320]   Hey, I apologize to all our listeners for being a little late on the TwiCasts, but Memorial
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   Day.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.560]   And I was down on Bourbon Street and I didn't wake up until Tuesday.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.560]   So.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.960]   He's drinking.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:21.200]   You know, in all honesty, Bourbon Street is a little over the top.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.240]   I mean, there are people just stumbling drunk all of them.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   It's like a frat party.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   And New Orleans.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   Yeah, it's like that year round last time I checked.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.240]   A frat party.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.740]   I was kind of appalled.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.440]   I mean, I'm no prude, but boy.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.880]   Isn't that the city that's going to disappear into the ocean in 20 years?
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.880]   Is it?
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:41.520]   Well, they've been saying that since the Civil War.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:46.800]   Well, I mean, the whole, they've been building bigger and bigger dikes around the perimeter
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.720]   of the city to keep the water out.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.960]   But at some point it's just going to go away.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.200]   Yeah, it's going to buy you.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.480]   I had a great time.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.960]   I met a lot of people who listed the Twitcast.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.640]   So things are going to hit with that, I think.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.880]   Not quite six terabytes yet, but it's a smaller file.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:04.880]   Six terabytes.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.880]   Got to live that band.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:08.000]   Congratulations on your success, Kevin, with System.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.560]   Congratulations on your new job.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.800]   Yo, she congratulations on your new apartment or house.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   What is it, Patrick?
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.560]   Oh, you're going to be writing another house.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   That's exciting.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.560]   Yes.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.720]   We'll get you into the home buyer market pretty soon here.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   Hey, you know what?
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.520]   So this I win that lottery ticket.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.480]   Robert Herron, congratulations on the new action figure.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.480]   Pull my string.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.000]   Ew.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.080]   It's another Twitcast for another week.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:37.520]   We'll be back back on Sunday next week.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, with technology--
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.920]   It's this question.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.480]   The Twit Broadcasting Network.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.200]   We now return you to your regularly broadcast program.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:58.920]   That's it for this edition of This Week in Tech.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:56:59.920]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.120]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.520]   Sorry about the late delivery.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.120]   I promise to get it out on time.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.760]   Tomorrow, we have our next edition.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.080]   If you'd like to send us a question,
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.480]   we will be using questions.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.760]   Again, I promise.

[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.480]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Tech.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:41.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:56.160]   Ooh, I got a good topic for next week.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.240]   Have you guys seen all the new airport security stuff popping up?
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.840]   I mean, a lot of it we already know about.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.720]   But the one that's really getting everyone crazy
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.880]   is that millimeter wave radar that they can go through clothing,
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.640]   but not skin.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.880]   It bounces back off.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.800]   So basically, they're going to be staring at naked people all day.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:16.360]   I've actually applied for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.040]   Let's talk about it next week.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.400]   That's good.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.040]   We have a good one.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.520]   That's a good tease.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.280]   Next week.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.800]   She's clear, Bob.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.080]   It's just a weird thing.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.520]   It's just a weird thing.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.240]   Wrap yourself in foil.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.160]   Is that a prosthetic?
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.960]   He's wrapped in foil, boys.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.800]   That's all real.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.280]   Secondary search.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   Well, this has been delightful.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.040]   You guys.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.360]   All right, people scare me.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.120]   This is good.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   We got a good one.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.200]   We'll talk to you later.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.080]   Guys, I'm out of here.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:49.800]   Good to find you.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.400]   All right, later.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.320]   How do you go, Samigos?
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.320]   Hang on.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:52.820]   Bye.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:53.320]   Bye.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.320]   Bye.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:54.820]   Bye.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.320]   Bye.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.320]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.920]   I can't miss you already.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.120]   Hang up right now.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.360]   I'm trying to find the quid button.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:06.200]   3, 2, 1, stop.
