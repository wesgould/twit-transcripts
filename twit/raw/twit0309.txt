[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.880]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech, a massive cast.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.800]   Joining us today, in fact, I imagine the cast
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.480]   will get larger and larger as we get closer and closer
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.360]   to our new studio, lots of people coming from all around
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.680]   to visit, to see the new studio in action,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.760]   and to pay a farewell to the old cottage.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.040]   Joining us for the first time, I think, on Twit, Ben Parr.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.920]   For Mashable, great to have you, Ben.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.720]   Glad to be here.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.800]   Welcome.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.320]   You were a celebrity this week.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840]   That's your definition of one.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.200]   Yes, in the Facebook.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.400]   That was really cool.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.040]   That was really cool.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.320]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.240]   Also joining us kind of--
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.200]   it isn't a surprise because you told me you were coming here,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.040]   but I just forgot to bake a cake, Mr. Race Lekinsky, who
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.920]   is an old friend.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.720]   Ray did the first really good podcast program
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.120]   called iPodRx with August Tremboner.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.920]   And that's when I first met up in Toronto.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.440]   Yep.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.360]   And he is now working for High Def, which is the Flavors.me
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.880]   company.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.920]   Yep.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.840]   And where do you do-- are you still in Toronto?
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.880]   Yeah, I'm working from home.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.200]   You're here for the Tricandra Conference.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.760]   Yes.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.560]   That's a no SQL variant.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.160]   Right.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.440]   Which means what?
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.000]   That's all right.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.440]   Never mind.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.040]   Yes, exactly.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.000]   Good to see you once again.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.520]   It's a database.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.360]   It's a database.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.880]   It's a database.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.400]   But it doesn't do-- you know, kid do queries.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.120]   It's flat.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880]   It's not relational.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.360]   Things have changed since they came up with a term
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.600]   now I can do queries.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.040]   No.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.400]   Yeah, so really nothing's changed.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.360]   There's no-- yeah.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.440]   Eventually it'll be just like SQL.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.000]   It automatically shards for me.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And that's really my big thing that I like to do.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.680]   Automatically what?
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.720]   Shards separates the data across multiple servers.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.280]   You heard it here first.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.080]   Also joining us, Mr. Mark Millian from CNN.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   How's it going, Leo?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.160]   Great to have you back, Mark.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.800]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.360]   That's a lovely studio you're in.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.160]   Oh, yes.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   It's a glorious timing office.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.560]   Got a plant that I stole from the lobby of the office.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.680]   Did you actually-- you just like, I
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.080]   need to have it in here for a quit.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   Yeah, every time I'm on TV, they say you're--
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.880]   You need a plant.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.040]   --you need to spike it up a little bit.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.880]   So that's what I do.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   I take the plant from the lobby.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.720]   It looks like his hair is the exact same thing.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.080]   Me, Millian?
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.360]   Also joining us from Houston, Texas, the Houston Chronicle,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.600]   our good friend Dwight Silverman blog,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.280]   dot cron.com/techblog.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.480]   Hey, Dwight, great to have you.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.720]   Hey, Leo, how you doing?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.200]   Nice to see you.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.760]   I know you were excited to talk about the Atlantis this week.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.560]   And look who we've brought in to play with us today.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.140]   A guy who was actually at the launch,
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.200]   Trey Radcliffe, our favorite photographer,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.440]   stuck in customs.com.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.840]   Hi, Trey.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.480]   Hello, Leo.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.360]   Hello, everybody.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.080]   It's good to see you.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.560]   You just got back like 10 minutes ago.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.120]   Yeah, I just got back from Cape Canaveral,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.040]   and I haven't even unpacked everything.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.640]   But I'm still all vibrating from the excitement.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.880]   It's funny because we rebroadcast the feed from spacevidcast.com.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.680]   They do such a great job.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.960]   It was kind of reminding me the old days of Walter Cronkite
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.200]   sitting in the tent and watching the launch and everything.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.240]   And they invited me to go.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   And you know why I didn't go?
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.920]   And I could have gone.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.240]   I thought, oh, I'll go, and they won't launch.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.520]   Because the last one, they launched a bunch four weeks later.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.440]   I'll go.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   And of course, what do they do?
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.920]   They've got a weather hold, a weather hold.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.480]   Oh, let's launch.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.880]   Boom.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.120]   So--
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.160]   Yeah, it went off.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.080]   And you know, Scobble was there, too.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.280]   And he was thinking the same thing.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.880]   It's not going to go off because I'm here.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.480]   I'm like, try to be optimistic, Scobble.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.560]   It might go off.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.480]   This is actually your second shuttle launch.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.440]   You were there last time, too.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.840]   Yeah, I was there for STS-134.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.520]   That's kind of their code system.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.160]   That was Endeavor.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.200]   It was scrubbed the first time.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.520]   Then I went back again.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.920]   And then I went for the final launch,
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.240]   and it was really magical.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.200]   The last shuttle.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.840]   Although, you know, and I'm sure people
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.040]   didn't talk about this at the time.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.200]   But I mean, there was generally the feeling that this--
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.320]   the shuttle was mostly theater, not so much really
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.520]   about space exploration.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   In fact, Esther Dyson called it the end of the beginning.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.480]   She's at the opinion that now we get serious about space
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.680]   exploration.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.880]   Well, I think we're going to see so much private stuff that
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.080]   starts to really go off.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.080]   And that's pretty exciting because the idea
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.840]   that the government doesn't have to do it,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.680]   that whole notion is so exhilarating.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.600]   I think we're going to see amazing stuff now.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.760]   Trade took a great shot of the--
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.200]   this is the night before, wasn't it?
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.040]   Yeah, I felt lucky.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.840]   I got an escort, and I was one of the last people
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.280]   to be there for its kind of final night on Earth.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.000]   And I felt like I shared a little personal moment with it.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.640]   And it was really a nice little evening there.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.520]   Now, have you started reviewing your pictures from the launch?
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.480]   Yeah, I've gone through a few of them.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.400]   It takes a while for me because I want to make sure that I--
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.000]   I have to be careful what I post because I
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.680]   wanted to make sure it's really high quality.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.120]   Robert was able to go post one immediately,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.640]   like three minutes after the launch.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.280]   Yeah, because he's not a pro.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.680]   No, no, he's still got a good shot, though.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.120]   But yeah, it was amazing because the thing is,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.040]   is that you're sitting there.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.440]   When in the press area, we're 3.1 miles away.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.480]   We're as close as they really let you get.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.920]   And you know it's going to be loud.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.320]   And it goes up, and then the sound comes across, and it is loud.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.600]   But then something else happens.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.120]   There's sort of this kinetics to cotto wave
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.680]   that rumbles across the water and slams into your chest
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.000]   and kind of shakes your skeleton and vibrates your soul.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.240]   And it's sort of this unholy feeling that's
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.320]   rocking through you as you're watching this thing go up.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.160]   All in the meantime, you're trying to get photos of this thing
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.360]   and capture the feeling of it.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.760]   So there's so much happening.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.000]   And there's the emotion.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It's the last one.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.160]   And all of us that are there are such enthusiasts.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   We're so into it.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.040]   We're completely impartial.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.000]   So there's a lot of stuff colliding.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.080]   Here's Robert's picture.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.120]   That was a pretty good picture, too.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.400]   I got to admit.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   Pretty true.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.000]   That was a nice description, by the way, Tre.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.360]   You could show him to the poetry.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.160]   Yeah, he's very poetic, Tre is.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.120]   Well, so you're glad you were there, obviously.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.960]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.600]   It was a little nerve-wracking, actually,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.000]   having a scoble so close to me because he's--
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.560]   that final 10 minutes, I need to focus on my craft.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.000]   I've got my multiple cameras and so on and so forth.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.840]   And he's there.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   He's kind of like that little thing on Java, the hut that's
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.000]   always laughing.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.440]   And so I took scoble a couple hundred yards away from me.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.800]   And I said, you stand here, Robert.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.960]   And point at the flag, focus on infinity F11, F13.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.040]   Yeah, this is good, Robert.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.520]   I'm going to help you get a great picture.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.600]   Stand over there.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.160]   And I said, I'll see you after the launch.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.760]   Yeah, I'll see you later, Robert.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.840]   You're going to get a great shot from right there, Robert.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.560]   No, he didn't end up getting a good shot, but it was great.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.720]   It was great fun.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.440]   That's so neat.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.560]   Well, I can't wait.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.000]   Now, I sent a donated to the cause.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.480]   We had-- I had my-- actually, it was my first DSLR,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.520]   my Nikon D70.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.280]   A beloved camera.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.720]   I took a lot of great pictures with it.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.120]   But it's been eclipsed by several cameras,
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.600]   since including the 5D Mark II.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.080]   So you said, well, I could use it.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.200]   I could put it next to-- so how close to the launch
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.040]   was that D70?
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.720]   There's a couple hundred feet.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.840]   You can't stand there.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.240]   But if you get an escort, you can go out
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.480]   and set up remote cameras.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.360]   And we set up two remote cameras, yours and another one.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.600]   And the plan was, my storybook vision of this
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.880]   is that your camera would end up as this--
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.720]   Melted Milford Sonic.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.440]   That we would have to go out and pull out these Nikon jars
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.120]   of light and peel it open and extract out a card that we then
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.320]   take to some CSI chamber to resolve the pixels that
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.240]   might be remaining.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.440]   But--
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.880]   Yeah, that's what you told me would happen.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.880]   That's not what happened?
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.320]   Well, it didn't turn out quite so histrionic.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.400]   Really, your camera's just a little bit damaged.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.360]   And I haven't gone through all the photos yet,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.800]   but I don't think we're going to see anything too impressive.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.160]   Oh, that's good.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.120]   It was there.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.600]   And it's probably got a little bit of something on it.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.040]   And I'll bring it back to the studio.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.080]   Please, yeah, we'll put it in a place of honor.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.040]   I couldn't be at the launch, but at least my camera could
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.480]   be there.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.800]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.480]   So you glad you went?
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.760]   Oh, yeah, I'm very happy I went.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.720]   Bit of history there.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.200]   It's nice.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.720]   It's real nice.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.200]   Pretty nice.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.360]   Thanks for sitting in your camera.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.720]   We had a good time.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.080]   Just the whole idea of it was really kind of--
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.680]   I'm just sorry I didn't get melted and destroyed.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.520]   Oh, well.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.640]   Yeah, it was cool.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.760]   Yeah, you say you like Nikon and Canon equally,
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.920]   yet the Nikon is what you offer up
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.680]   to die in a fiery, unful of exposure.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.040]   I don't think I've ever said I like Nikon and Canon equally.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   I am now a full-board Canon shooter.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.720]   Although, as I said, my first DSLR was an Nikon,
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.040]   and I love that D70.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.720]   You know, the other choice for that, I kind of went back and
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.280]   forth, was to send it up to Washington State and have it
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.040]   turned into an infrared camera.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.400]   But I think this was a good use for it.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.440]   Yes, maybe you still can.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.960]   It depends on if we can get it fixed or not.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.920]   You don't have to fix it.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.080]   I don't want it to be fixed.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.600]   Try to make a clip.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.360]   So great to have you.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.840]   Thank you for joining us and sharing some--
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.000]   first-person observations from the shuttle launch.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.800]   Atlantis is up there now.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.440]   In fact, we just watched video of them
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.200]   docking with the International Space Station and the
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   meet and greet as they got onboard the ISS.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.720]   And then the program ends.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.480]   What's-- I actually would like to open this up to the panel.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.200]   What now-- is it going to be citizen space?
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.040]   Is it going to be privatized?
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.560]   One of the things that NASA wants to do, of course, is
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.160]   focus on manned, unmanned expeditions to Mars and other
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.520]   places.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.800]   Let's start with you, Trey, and then I'll let the panel speak.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.360]   Well, it's a good question.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.160]   I think that people do like to get their heads around a big
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.240]   idea.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.120]   And it's inspiring.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.760]   I'm a little bummed out that NASA hasn't announced
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.880]   something really, really awesome, like the successor
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.720]   to the space shuttle.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.280]   Got no more.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280]   There's--
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:26.960]   I know.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.000]   I know.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.120]   Although, it is hard--
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.800]   It is hard to say that the $20 billion that we spend on
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.240]   NASA actually is the same amount of money it took to air
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.840]   condition, the troops in Afghanistan, and Iraq for one
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.680]   year.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.360]   So it sounds like a lot of money, but compared to what we
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.800]   spend money on, it's not a particularly large amount of
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.000]   money.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.120]   Well, they're still going to be doing manned space flights.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.600]   They're just doing it in a different way.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.840]   They don't have something quite as exciting as a space shuttle
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.360]   once was when it was announced.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.280]   But we do live in this sci-fi time where we see amazing
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.440]   inventions right and left.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.280]   And I think we really want to get excited about sci-fi space
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.440]   travel right now.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.280]   That's what I mean.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.240]   I have to say, when I talk to scientists, the sci-fi is
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.120]   what excites them.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.000]   They end up doing what they read about the sci-fi.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.320]   You've got to excite kids.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.200]   You've got to get them going.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.800]   And I think a space program is a good way to do it.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.040]   Ben Parr, what do you think?
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.280]   The future of NASA.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.880]   I actually wrote and did a lot of research for an article
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.800]   that I published this week about the private space race,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.400]   because I was fascinated by everything that's been happening.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.360]   I really think it is--
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.440]   It's the X-prize.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.320]   I mean, there's a lot of--
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.280]   And the X-prize people are amazing people.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.440]   You have SpaceX, which is Elon Musk, a space company.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.840]   And that's been growing quite substantially.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.600]   And then you have Virgin Galactic and Richard Branson.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.360]   And they're going to be starting those space flights $200,000
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.080]   a pop.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.800]   But they're going to be starting them next year.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.560]   They're barely-- they're suborbital.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.080]   They're barely in the space.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.560]   That one is barely in space.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.760]   But with each excessive one, it gets higher and higher.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.240]   And the thing is, it's--
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.320]   I mean, you had to start off with innovation, I guess,
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.320]   in the public sector, because no one else could afford the
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.520]   programs that were needed in the 1960s and such to build
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.680]   rockets to the moon.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.440]   But now the costs are going down.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.400]   The technology is getting better.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.240]   And hopefully what's going to happen is when the private
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.600]   sector really, really hammers it hard, it's going to--
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.880]   costs are going to go down.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.840]   And it's going to become more and more accessible.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.480]   I know you were really excited about this.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.400]   But you're near mine, Houston.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.640]   You didn't want to go over to the Cape?
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.400]   Well, it's a long way from Houston to Cape Canaveral.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.280]   I didn't go.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.880]   We sent several of our columnists and bloggers over there,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.360]   including Eric Berger, our science blogger, who did some
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.880]   excellent work out of there.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.520]   I'm kind of interested in what's happening here in Houston
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.400]   as a result of the end of the shuttle program.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.160]   A lot of the support, and certainly like mission control,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.440]   is based here.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.800]   And there's going to be a lot of layoffs.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.160]   But what's interesting is, because Johnson Space Center
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.280]   is here, there has been almost like a Silicon Valley
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.800]   effect.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.160]   There are a lot of private space operations here.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.200]   Companies that supported NASA as contractors, and now they're
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.760]   going to be off on their own.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.720]   And my suspicion is that you could see a lot of the
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.360]   innovation taking place from those companies that at one
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.080]   time supported the shuttle program.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.440]   They're now in order to survive.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.400]   We're going to have to innovate.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.680]   And I think it's going to be really interesting around here
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.520]   for the next few years.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.200]   And there'll be a lot of aerospace engineers looking for work.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.920]   That's right.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.240]   And a lot of those aerospace engineers will start their
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.760]   own companies, or they'll become affiliated with SpaceX or
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.480]   one of the other private companies.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.840]   And I think you're going to start to see--
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.800]   when they're layoffs in Silicon Valley, those people just
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.680]   don't go live in a box under a--
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.040]   True.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.680]   --bridge.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.240]   They start their own companies.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.680]   And during layoffs, you actually have a lot of
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.560]   innovation happening.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.360]   And I think that's what's going to occur here.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:57.960]   It's exciting.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.400]   I think it's really exciting.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   But I just hope we don't stop.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.680]   Mark Millian, you're a young guy.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.800]   You don't remember as I do, and Dwight does.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.480]   God, I'm never--
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.400]   I mean, I grew-- I got up every middle of the night to
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.480]   watch first Mercury, then Gemini, then Apollo.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.200]   I'll never forget--
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.840]   I'm sure you remember this vividly, Dwight, watching
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.280]   the alarm strong walk on the moon.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.360]   I sat in front of my parents' television set with a
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.320]   little Iowa real-to-real tape recorder holding a microphone
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.400]   up to the speaker.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.240]   And I still have those tapes of Walter Cronkite wiping a
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.360]   tear up from his eye.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.520]   Unbelievable.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.200]   Yeah, it was--
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.320]   I watched on YouTube.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.280]   You watched on YouTube?
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.560]   That's the-- there you go.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.040]   It must excite your generation, too, Mark.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.720]   Yes?
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.920]   Yeah, I mean, I'm actually not much of a space guy myself,
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.920]   although I know a lot of people my age are huge Star Trek and
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.880]   Star Wars fans, which has to have some correlation to
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.000]   being interested in space.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.320]   I mean, from a further off perspective, I agree with Ben
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.040]   and pretty much everyone else on the panel that it seems like
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.680]   space exploration is at a time where the private sector
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.440]   can take it over.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.360]   I think that's kind of been the job of the federal government
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.760]   to shuttle a technology--
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.520]   no pun intended--
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.080]   to shuttle a technology to a certain extent, like they did
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.840]   with DARP and that before it became this privatized thing.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.520]   As the internet or with GPS, I think space is at a time
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.560]   where NASA can now focus on deep space exploration, and they
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.280]   can leave it up to private corporations to figure out
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.600]   moon bases and all that stuff.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.360]   I don't know why, but I'm just skeptical that private
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.920]   enterprise is going to be able to do this.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.400]   It just feels like something a government or maybe even
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   better multinational governments should do.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.760]   Here's one thing I'd hate.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.200]   I don't want to see a space station with corporate logos on it.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.000]   I don't want to see our future in space become commercial.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.800]   Isn't that the risk of doing something like this, Ben?
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   But the problem is that's how the economy turns
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.720]   on how the economy goes.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.720]   That's how you fund a lot of the technologies.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.960]   That's how we fund our medicine.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.640]   That's how we fund private--
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Yeah, it's worked so well with big pharma, hasn't it?
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.600]   You get the pros and cons, I agree.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.440]   But it's better than not going into space at all.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:32.960]   Well, I agree.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.040]   I hope we do go into space.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.360]   It just feels like this is something
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.360]   that should be supported by a multinational effort.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.240]   But I guess the ISS is not a huge success.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.920]   What do you think, Ray?
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.840]   Well, I grew up purely with the shuttle program.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.680]   So I was very--
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.400]   You didn't get Gemini in that follow?
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:48.840]   No.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.400]   No, I remember when the shuttle flew over my school
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.520]   in the early '80s, which was a treat.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.800]   I've never seen a launch.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.080]   But I've watched pretty much every single one
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.600]   that I could on TV and on the internet
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.480]   when that became available.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.760]   So I have a strong connection to the shuttle program.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.400]   But I really hope that we do progress and do something
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.120]   more because it really feels like it's
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.040]   been stagnant for 10 years.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.440]   We've done all the science experiments multiple times.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.920]   We need to do something else.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.640]   Part of the problem is there's no competition.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.520]   I mean, the reason for the original space race
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.360]   was the competition.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.800]   We try to beat the riskies.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.640]   And you don't have anything like that right now.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.560]   Maybe there will be something like that in a couple years.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.800]   It's competition breeds innovation.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.400]   It was great.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.120]   We-- about a month ago, we heard JFK's, the tapes from JFK's office,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.520]   talking about the space program.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.880]   And it was very clear that for JFK,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.000]   it was theater.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.040]   It wasn't about science.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.160]   It was about beating the Soviets.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.280]   He said, I want to make sure that the money I'm spending here
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.920]   is going to-- we're going to beat him, right?
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.360]   Because it was otherwise no point from his point of view,
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.160]   which is a shame.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.520]   He also made it that it had to be completed within his term.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   It was political.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.960]   It was political four or five terms,
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.880]   which both cases are political, but such short timelines,
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.440]   drives innovation as well.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440]   Right.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.520]   Well, I think we all agree that we
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.240]   want more space exploration, maybe not necessarily manned.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.640]   I mean, the truth of it is the science is probably better done
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.160]   by unmanned missions, yes.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.240]   Yeah, overall.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   Still, it would be great.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.200]   It's not as romantic if you don't have somebody say--
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.640]   No, I want to be able to be watching from my screen.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   It's hopefully someday someone putting their foot on Mars.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.960]   I do too.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.080]   And you know, it's funny because for a long time, I've said,
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.840]   there's a kid right now in school, probably high school
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   or elementary school, who will be the first person on Mars.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.360]   I really thought that five years ago.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.840]   I'm not sure I think that today.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.640]   Yeah, I think it may not happen as soon as that.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.840]   I think one of the interesting things
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.320]   about the idea of commercial space exploration
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.040]   is that governments, while you can raise a lot of money,
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.080]   governments still have a lot more money.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.360]   They can guarantee that it's safer.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.280]   And to a certain extent, depending on the government,
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.200]   there is a chain of accountability.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.520]   The only accountability you have in the private sector
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.640]   is to the shareholders and to profit.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.040]   And without much motivation for profit,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:24.160]   I don't know how far or how deep the bench
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.000]   is for private space endeavor.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.480]   I just don't--
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.400]   I'm with you, Dwight.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.240]   I'm with you.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.560]   I mean, I think it needs to be a joint venture
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.280]   of private and public.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.920]   But ultimately, the public sector, it's in society's interest.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.800]   And I just hate to see it be--
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.320]   Right.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.960]   And look what they're starting with.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.880]   They're starting with space tourism,
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.640]   where you can pay $200,000 in buy a ticket.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.800]   They're also talking about doing some supply missions
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.000]   to the space station.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.400]   And that's kind of interesting, I think.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.080]   But I don't see somebody like SpaceX 10 years from now
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.800]   establishing moon bases that will then use to go to Mars.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   They just don't seem to be that sophisticated
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.720]   and have that kind of financial depth.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.400]   There's not enough profit in it.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.720]   Right.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:14.960]   Right.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.880]   Some stuff you do because it's for humankind.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.080]   Right.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.480]   And you know, I was listening to JFK's speech, which was--
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.880]   Oh, this decade is out.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.200]   Which was done here in Houston at Rice University.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.960]   And he was-- yeah, it was theater, but it gave us--
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.560]   it gave us as a nation a goal.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.720]   It made us-- it tapped into the very thing that caused
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.320]   this continent to be populated.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.280]   And that was both--
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.080]   we have to go there, and that's the frontier.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.520]   There was also profit in populating this--
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.000]   Well, and I think that's the thing.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.720]   I think among us, it's pretty clear to us
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.400]   that there's emotional and benefit,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.280]   that there's societal benefit, there's
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.680]   huge scientific benefit.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.720]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.200]   It's just hard to get--
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.880]   unfortunately, it's hard to get government struggling
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.160]   with an unemployment rate of 9.2% and financial huge deficits
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.360]   to suspend even $20 billion on a space program.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.600]   And that's unfortunate.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.760]   All I guess all we can do is lobby for it
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   and encourage private sector to do what they can as well.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.080]   But I'm with you-- I don't think, Dwight, that the private sector,
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.440]   ultimately, they're going to operate for profit.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.360]   And it ultimately doesn't necessarily match our interest
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.080]   as a society.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.160]   I know NASA's going to go on.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.840]   I just hope that they continue to go to the Mars and on.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.160]   Well, I was glad--
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:48.720]   Asteroids.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.800]   There's some good stuff on those asteroids.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.000]   A lot of money on the asteroids.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.440]   There's a lot of-- we talk about natural resources running low,
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.520]   but asteroids are huge.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.040]   Some of those asteroids-- $50 billion worth
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.840]   of precious resources.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.760]   So there's profit there.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.200]   Well, I want to thank you, Trey, for being here.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.720]   I appreciate it.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.960]   I'm sure you're exhausted.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.200]   Yeah, I am tired.com.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.280]   And you want to unpack?
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   It's so bad that we could talk to you.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.240]   And so are you going to start working on those pictures?
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.400]   We're going to see a picture a day for a while or?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.480]   Yeah, a picture a day.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.160]   That's my meager promise to the internet.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.200]   It didn't look for me.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.120]   And on Google+, as well as on Facebook and on Twitter
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.840]   and at stuckincustoms.com.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.360]   Actually, you're posting a ton of great pictures on Google+.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:35.620]   Thanks.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.320]   I love it.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.680]   I think it's great for photographers.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.120]   It's a pretty exciting thing.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.120]   I would say in many ways, Google+ is the place to go now
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.920]   for photographers.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.200]   I have a whole photography circle.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.840]   And the images I'm seeing are just spectacular.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.960]   I'm just really pleased with it.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.520]   And of course, you're number one on that list.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.800]   Well, I don't know how that happened,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.200]   but I'm very thankful.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.000]   And I've been able to at least use that
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.960]   to promote a lot of other photographers.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.380]   I have other photographer list and suggestions
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.720]   for people that want to make new circles.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.800]   And we do Hangouts to help people learn photography.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.400]   We even did a live Hangout from the shuttle launch.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.280]   I saw that.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.560]   And on the plane later, coming home.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.640]   Yeah, it's a lot of fun, just meeting people
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.600]   from all over the world.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.840]   Because so many people are interested in photography now.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.440]   And they just want to get a little bit better.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.880]   And man, these things are really engaging and fun.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.840]   And it's nice.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.480]   Doug Griffin in the Google+ was known for that.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.040]   Was the first Hangout on a plane.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.320]   I think I saw one before yours.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.880]   Yeah, I don't know if it was or not.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.560]   It's a great--
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.640]   It's a great picture of you with a woman sleeping behind you
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.720]   as you do your Hangout.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.200]   Yeah, she was knocked out.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.160]   It was hard to get chloroform onto that hot towel.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.400]   Oh, great.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.120]   There is someone who has already Photoshopped a photo of Scoble
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.000]   as the little thing on Java the Hut.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.520]   Oh, no.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.320]   Where is that?
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.640]   I got to see that.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.320]   It's Leo, I pushed it into the chat for this call on--
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.400]   It's like a tweet.com/scoble.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.000]   Is it from the chat room?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.760]   No, that one.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.560]   That's a scapegoat.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.480]   Yeah, no, I can't get over there.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.000]   Was it in the chat room?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.200]   No, no, I pushed it to your--
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.920]   Somebody put it in the chat room, would they?
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.800]   Because I can click that link.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.120]   I can't click the link.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.640]   See, Dwight, you're behind me.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.000]   Hi.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.160]   Well, tell me what it is.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.200]   Maybe I could type it in here.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.440]   It's a pixelweight.com.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:41.400]   P-I-X-E-L-W-E-I-G-H-T, pixelweight.com/scoble.html.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.240]   What is pixelweight?
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.280]   I've never heard of that.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.080]   I don't have it either.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.880]   We're about to hear about it, though.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.120]   Because it's pixelweight.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.080]   Oh, my god.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.360]   Ladies and gentlemen--
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.720]   You know, it was pretty easy, actually.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   I think it was easy.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.800]   It wasn't a lot of work.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.160]   I'm posting that to my Google+ right after this.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.760]   See how long it takes to get on Google+.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.280]   I introduced that to me.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.280]   Trey will let you go to bed.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.320]   Thank you, Trey Radcliffe.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.560]   Great to talk to you once again.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.480]   Thanks for a great job.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.400]   We'll look for you on Google+ Twitter
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.840]   and stuck in customs.com.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.760]   Does everybody have a Google+ account?
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.280]   Yep.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:18.640]   Yep.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.960]   OK, invites are now going out.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.800]   Apparently, I've got an invite at the bottom of my page here.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.880]   And because Zuckerberg has 100,000 followers on Google+,
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.680]   I figured there's at least 100,000 people.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.280]   I think there's a good deal more.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.520]   They're really kind of ramping up--
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.320]   Schmitt said millions.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.480]   They're really--
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.440]   That's credible?
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.640]   They're really ramping up the thing,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.000]   because they're publicly launching sometime soon.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.240]   So we're just around the corner.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.480]   We'll talk about that.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.120]   And a lot more in just a little bit.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.940]   But first, let's get Tom Merritt here and find out what's
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.320]   coming up.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.600]   Tom Merritt, of course, does our great team.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.120]   It's the TNT show.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.960]   And that's our daily news show, 2.30 PM Pacific 530 Eastern.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.560]   Live.twit.tv.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.360]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.400]   Here's a look at what we'll be covering on Tech News
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.600]   today in the week ahead.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.840]   Starting today, July 10 through July 14,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.480]   Microsoft's having its worldwide partner conference in LA.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.320]   Expect a lot of Windows 8 news out of there.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.120]   Monday, July 11, office XP extended support is over.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.920]   So either upgrade or you're on your own.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.120]   Also, Monday, July 11, the finale of RoboCop 2011,
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.880]   and this is Apple Turkey, the robots win.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.480]   Tuesday, July 12, UK extradition appeal for Julian Assange
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.240]   begins.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.160]   Thursday's a busy day.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.320]   We may see a MacBook Air or an OS 10 Lion release from Apple.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.160]   We'll definitely see a Call of Duty Elite beta.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.120]   And the Motorola Droid III officially
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.040]   hits Verizon for $200.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.000]   And Friday, July 15, the HP touchpad
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.040]   goes on sale in the UK for 399 pounds.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.760]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:40.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.160]   Where is Tom?
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.480]   Is he in the new studio?
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:44.980]   Hold on.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.360]   Holy come, moly here.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:46.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.040]   Look at this.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.840]   Apparently, they let Tom onto the set early.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.640]   This actually isn't exactly how it's going to look.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.680]   But that is he is on the set of TNT in the new studio.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.320]   That big X really is there.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.280]   But there'll be more books and stuff behind him.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.160]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.400]   That's kind of-- in some ways, that's
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.880]   the first official view of the new studio.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.960]   Ray, you were just over there.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   It was.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.640]   It's amazing.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.320]   It's pretty cool.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.000]   It's pretty exciting.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.400]   We'll be back with more and just a bit
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.800]   with our great guests, Ben Parr from Mashable,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.960]   Ray Slakinski from Hi-Def.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:23.080]   Also joining us from CNN with his potted plant, Mark Millian.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.360]   And also, it's great to have you Dwight Sullivan from the Houston.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.960]   Chronicle, I want to talk a little bit about GoToAssist Express
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.560]   briefly here.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.680]   If you are in the IT business, you
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.640]   know that remote support is critical to your mission.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.480]   And there is no better remote support solution
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.280]   than GoToAssist Express.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.200]   You ever do remote support, right?
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.480]   For your stuff, your software?
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:44.880]   No.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.400]   No.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.240]   You thank out your lucky stars.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:47.760]   Yes.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.400]   We have two wonderful support people that handle it.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.280]   So we have a lot of them that go, OK.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.320]   Click the Start button.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   OK.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.120]   Now scroll down.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   OK, control panels.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.080]   OK.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.120]   Now, who wants to do that?
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.240]   You know, when I first started, I first started
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.320]   doing customer support for desktop software.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:04.920]   It is such a pain.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.800]   I did it for Symantec and a couple small houses as well.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.200]   That's right.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:07.720]   I knew that.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.440]   That's why I thought maybe-- yeah.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.640]   Did WinFac support?
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.240]   WinFac.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.520]   Can you imagine configuring people's modems over the phone?
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.360]   It is 18.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   And--
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.280]   And you know, the answer--
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.200]   Say OK.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.480]   OK, not AndD plus OK.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.440]   It was horrible.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.440]   I wish we had this.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.960]   This would have saved you a lot of time.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.320]   You could just type it right in.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.040]   You could do up to eight sessions at once.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.120]   You could do unattended sessions.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.480]   So once you get installing-- and by the way,
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.480]   if you're a client, Mac or PC doesn't have it installed,
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:33.920]   no problem.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.960]   You send them a link.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.680]   They click the link.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.520]   And literally, 30 seconds later, you're in.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.280]   You're working on it.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.480]   You're fixing the problem.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.760]   And from then on, unattended support is available.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.640]   Frost and Sullivan, who-- it's an analyst group that
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.240]   analyzes this sector call to go to Assist Express,
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.560]   the worldwide market leader in remote support.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.480]   I don't know why they put this in the copy.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.200]   Leo says it's the one you got to get.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.760]   That's all you need to know.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.880]   We started using it in the screen savers.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.040]   I never stopped using it.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.080]   And I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.840]   It's very simple.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.800]   If you visit the website, gotocyst.com/twit.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.240]   30 days free.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.600]   If you're in support, or even if just mom and dad
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.280]   need some help, 30 days free should be enough to fix their
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:12.640]   problem.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.440]   Go to assist.com/twit.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.240]   They have day passes for people to do this all the time.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.640]   We all support our moms and dads.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.400]   We're painting the butt.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.760]   I mean, mom, I love you.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.320]   I made my parents switch to a Mac to support them.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.280]   Because I haven't touched a Windows computer in--
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.240]   I actually have that deal.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.960]   Like six, seven years.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.160]   I have that deal with all my family members.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.880]   If they buy a Windows PC, they're on their own.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.680]   But if they buy a Mac, I'll help them.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.840]   I gave my mom my iPad, too, so she could Skype with me.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.520]   In some ways, for those people, the iPad is really the
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.320]   future, isn't it?
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:45.960]   I think so.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.080]   There's just--
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:49.960]   There's no security.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.120]   There's no support issues.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.880]   It's just boom.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.360]   My mom got an iPad 2 for Christmas, and she hasn't really
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   used her desktop since.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.880]   She uses numbers for all her spreadsheets.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.520]   One of the rumors is that we will see a new iPad
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.120]   in September, a high-res iPad, not quite a red-to-display.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.040]   We're getting all these rumors out of digit times and the
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.320]   Chinese suppliers.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.240]   Also, the latest is that there will be a new iPhone in the
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.120]   fall, but it'll just really be kind of a reskinned iPhone
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.440]   4, and then the iPhone 5 won't be out till next year.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.240]   I mean, that makes sense.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.240]   I mean, the 3GS came out with it.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.240]   It's in the fourth year, right?
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.560]   It's like iPhone 3G to 3GS, iPhone 4.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.920]   You think there'll be a 4G iPhone?
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   Not this year, though.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.080]   Not probably next year.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.360]   That's the 5.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.040]   What do you hear, Mark?
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.880]   I know you got your ears to the--
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.680]   My guess is iPhone 4S, then iPhone 4G.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.360]   And the G will be--
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.280]   And the G will be--
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.640]   And the 4S is going to be dual-band Verizon and AT&T.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.160]   Right.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.600]   They use that Qualcomm chip.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   They already had that in the Verizon iPhone.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.680]   They just haven't taken advantage of the GSM part of it.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.840]   So let's talk about Google Plus.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.280]   We won't belabor the point.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.600]   We've talked about it for the last two weeks.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.400]   But for some reason, the tech community
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.080]   has just fallen in love with this thing.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:13.760]   You use it, Ben.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.600]   What do you think?
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.400]   What is this?
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.720]   Is it the user interface?
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.360]   What is it?
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.920]   I have a theory, but I'm going to let you speak first.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.960]   It's a combination.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.440]   One, you have--
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.520]   It's the community.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.480]   It's early tech adopters.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.840]   Early tech adopters like early tech adopters.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   That's my theory.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.680]   You saw it.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.800]   Oh.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.640]   Because as soon as the rest of the world comes in,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.120]   it's like, where else can we go?
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.000]   Exactly.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.240]   And the current market that's on Google Plus right now
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.240]   is not general--
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   It's not normal.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:40.760]   --of that.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.920]   And that's the market that Google has to in,
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.600]   if it actually wants to be competitive in the social networking
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:45.920]   space.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.600]   Otherwise, it's going to be friend feed.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.240]   Right.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:48.600]   It is.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.520]   It's another friend feed.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.360]   Didn't we all love Google Buzz when I first came out and what?
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.720]   I loved Buzz.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   I left because--
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   Not so much.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   Not so much?
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.520]   Do I like you didn't like Buzz?
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.800]   I didn't like Buzz because I felt like it was forced on me.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   Well, it was.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   You know, on the email.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.280]   Grafting it on the email was, I think, a really bad idea.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.400]   Email is email.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.000]   And it just didn't--
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.960]   I didn't want it.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.800]   And I can't make up my mind about Google Plus.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.360]   It feels really friend feedy.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.640]   And I think that's because of who's there at the moment.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.640]   Well, you know the big difference?
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.920]   But also, it doesn't show me anything that much different
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.400]   from Facebook.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.240]   But it isn't a friend feed because you can't pipe your other stuff
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   into it, which was the thing that was the seminal feature
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.960]   of friend feed all along was that you'd
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.120]   pipe your Twitter and all--
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:32.960]   And I think that's what--
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.520]   Buzz did that, too.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.560]   And I think it's what killed both friend feed and buzz
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.880]   is they became aggregators.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.880]   And so every--
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.320]   Well, what happens with social networks, I think--
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.760]   I think that piping one thing to the next generally
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.160]   doesn't work because you lose context.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.360]   The kind of things that you say on Twitter,
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.400]   when I see them piped into Facebook
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.040]   and see kind of the responses, they're like disjointed.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.800]   It doesn't quite match.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.240]   And I think I'm glad that Google+ is not doing that.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.000]   But--
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.360]   Because all of these are native Google+ posts.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.440]   So you don't see people posting.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.080]   And that is a difference.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.160]   Big difference.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.880]   The other big one is that--
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.920]   I mean, the reason they called it just plus is because they
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.200]   just want to make as an addition to Google,
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.880]   as everything on Google is Google+.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.240]   And--
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.800]   You can't get away from this black bar
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.400]   at the top of the Google now.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.000]   Every Google thing you use has this black bar on it.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.640]   Don't you think that's going to change when you release
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.800]   the API that we're going to see the tweet to Google+?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.000]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   That's a good question.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.760]   I think they probably shouldn't be focusing on--
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.600]   It was not too.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.320]   --an importing other feeds in, like I said--
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.800]   They won't.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.400]   But as soon as they have the API, other people are going to.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.680]   And then it's going to--
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.200]   Screw up.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.280]   You're right.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.760]   Because that's the first thing I'll do is I'll say,
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.200]   how can I get my Twitter feed into Google+.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.360]   Or should I say, how can I get my Google+ feed into my Twitter?
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.960]   I think Google would prefer that.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.360]   That would be a better way to go, wouldn't it?
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:01.600]   But--
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.840]   So if you make a good enough UI and make people--
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.120]   which is very sticky right now, it's obvious--
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:07.880]   keep it very sticky.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.520]   Keep people living in Google+.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.120]   And don't take stuff in, but only allow porting out.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.080]   Doesn't that work too?
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.120]   Having you seen the Facebook posts inside of Twitter,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.760]   where they stop mid-sentence and then there's a link--
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.260]   I hate those.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.400]   And you never follow them.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.040]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.320]   Or you unfollow those people?
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.040]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.920]   So that's the point about social networks not
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.600]   working with each other.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.320]   I think Twitter is best in its 140 character native state.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.040]   Facebook is best in its native state.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:48.520]   And I hope that Google+ does not allow
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.520]   importing of other social networks.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.880]   I think that'll mess it up.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.440]   But on the other hand, I've watched
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.280]   as a lot of people who aren't techies go into it.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.600]   A lot of the readers of I column have gone into it.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.640]   What do they think?
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.720]   I don't know any of them.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.280]   A lot of them are looking at it going, what's different here?
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:10.040]   Why do I need to leave Facebook with this?
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.480]   They kind of don't see a why yet.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.040]   And those who aren't interested in social media,
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.920]   or social media is sake, they don't quite
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.160]   see the why should I be here yet.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.120]   That's crucial.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.160]   You've got to love this post from Vic Gundotra,
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.080]   senior vice president of engineering at Google, who said,
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.960]   please accept our apologies for the spam we caused this afternoon.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.760]   He's posting to Google+ for about 80 minutes.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.560]   We ran out of disk space.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   How did you do this?
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.000]   I grew the world out of disk space.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.680]   We ran out of disks.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.840]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like you all
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   to mail your spare hard drives to Google.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.720]   They obviously need them.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.600]   Please, let's get that address, Eileen.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.920]   And we'll give it out to everybody.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.520]   They ran out of disk space in the service
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.200]   that keeps track of notifications.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.440]   So they spent the notifications over and over again.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:36:59.920]   What is it?
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.200]   What if they had a two terabyte drive and they ran out?
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.360]   That is the weirdest bug I have ever heard of.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.560]   Maybe they just did that so they could brag about it.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.480]   We ran out of disk space.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.240]   That's to me, that's the highlight of Google+
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.520]   in the first three weeks right there.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.440]   We actually did ask on Google+, we might do this more,
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.240]   for your suggestions for stories we should cover on the show.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   And we picked one that was not in our list
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.560]   that we'll cover in just a second.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.000]   That's one of the uses of this.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.200]   I've been doing Hangouts.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.080]   That's been fun.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.880]   But after a while, it's like, OK, I got a big deal.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.560]   Well, I guess we'll have to wait and see
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.440]   how they hook this all together, how the wiring
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.600]   and the plumbing comes in.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.200]   You were great.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.560]   I think Hangouts really is the competitive advantage.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.960]   I mean, that's unusual, isn't it?
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.000]   Very few other services are doing
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.720]   and no mainstream services are doing.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.880]   I mean, Facebook, just a week after they launched,
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.040]   plus was racing to catch up with this Skype feature
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.840]   they've been working on for about a year.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.600]   But that can only do one-on-one Hangouts is up to,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.880]   what is it, 10 people.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   But I think Dwight was on to something
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.240]   when he's saying social networks aren't interoperable.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.140]   You don't want to push your Twitter to Facebook,
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.540]   or even vice versa, and putting them into buckets,
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.380]   I use Facebook for people I know in real life,
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.460]   and then Twitter for more work-type stuff.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:25.540]   And I haven't figured out where plus fits into the whole world
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.420]   of that.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.060]   I think you're not alone.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.340]   So Facebook did have an awesome announcement.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.780]   Well, kind of a sort-- you were there, Ben.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.380]   Sort of an awesome-- well, it was kind of boring, actually.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.380]   This is the announcement.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.860]   They added-- well, they did three things.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.940]   They put group chat into chat.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.580]   They redesigned chat to accommodate that.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.940]   Those were the non-announcements.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:47.540]   The big announcement was they've added video.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.140]   So let me see.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.060]   I'm in chat right now.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.140]   I see Becky Worley's name.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.660]   Let me start a video called Becky Worley.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.060]   This is Skype, built into Facebook.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.100]   And at first, I kind of said, ah-ha.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.460]   Yeah, we've had this in Yahoo Messenger, MSN, Messenger,
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.220]   Google Talk, MySpace.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.420]   Tom Anderson on Google+ said, oh, we had that in 2006.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.700]   But I have to say, remember, this is Facebook.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.500]   And in a way, what I just did is
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.860]   going to be a revelation for a lot of Facebook users,
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.980]   the ability just to click a button
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.460]   and start a Skype call with their family and friends.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.980]   Maybe this is a little more awesome than we give them credit
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.500]   for.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.460]   So let me record a message to Becky here.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.980]   That's a neat feature all in some of that.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.740]   Isn't that great?
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:31.980]   Video message.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.940]   So there we go, OK?
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.620]   Hey, Worley.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.820]   It's me, Leo.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.180]   How the hell are you?
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.060]   It's saw some video for Crying Out Loud.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.940]   All right, and now I've left that nice message for Becky.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.940]   And--
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:48.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.940]   Nice.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.580]   Well, let's--
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   Hey, Worley!
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.140]   All right, it worked.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.380]   And then there we go.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.340]   I'll just send that along.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.460]   I think you just texted.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.220]   Did I just kill it?
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:01.980]   Yeah, you just killed it.
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.700]   Oh, never mind.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.180]   Oh, well.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.420]   So maybe it's not that easy for grandma and grandpa, huh?
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.980]   No, I think that that's huge.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.140]   And I think it's big for Skype on the eve of their acquisition
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.220]   by Microsoft.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.060]   But I think even more important, that 750 million people
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.420]   are now going to have a very trivial, simple, easy way
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.380]   to call the grandkids, to call each other.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.660]   Don't you think that's pretty important, Mark?
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.860]   I mean, I know you know how to use Skype.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.740]   It's way bigger than FaceTime.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.540]   I mean, Apple had said a year and a half ago, or at least
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.820]   over a year ago, that they were going to open up FaceTime,
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.380]   and they never did it.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.780]   I think they thought they had the competitive advantage
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.660]   and it never worked out.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.660]   That's a really good point.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.380]   This is what FaceTime should have been.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.340]   This is the video phone.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.380]   This is what they were showing in the 1965 World's Fair.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.380]   Only it works.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.460]   Well, video chat-- I mean, all of these chat services
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.380]   are about who can reach critical mass first.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.860]   And when Apple first introduced FaceTime,
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.180]   I think they thought they were playing catch up.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.140]   And they said, we're going to open source this,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.260]   and we're going to let everybody use it.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.620]   We want this to be the video chat standard.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.860]   And they never did that, because I think they saw FaceTime
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.300]   as this competitive advantage.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.660]   People will buy Apple products to get this video chat service.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.420]   And I think Skype with Facebook kind of changes that.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.300]   They've all of a sudden, overnight,
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.460]   reached this much greater audience.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.020]   You agree, Ben.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.660]   I mean, you were at the announcement.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.100]   What was the reaction initially?
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.060]   I'd say my initial reaction is Apple.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.420]   But then I started to think about it.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.540]   And I did think this is pretty big.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.340]   I think it's the same kind of-- exactly that.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.820]   I mean, we were like, ooh, it's not as pretty or as unique,
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.140]   or as cool as Google Hangouts.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.380]   But one-on-one video calling is important to a lot of people.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.100]   And a lot of people aren't looking for just 10-person video
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:52.300]   chats.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.700]   A lot of most people are looking for one on one.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.340]   I want to see the grandkids.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.340]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.740]   And this makes that easy.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.660]   You don't have to have a directory.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.700]   They're already in there.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.540]   Well, if your grandkids are 13 or over, of course.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.460]   Well, your children are in there, and the children
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.420]   will hold up the baby.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.180]   All those things, Apple-- exactly your right, Mark,
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.620]   million-- those things Apple put in their FaceTime ads
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.220]   that never really happened.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.300]   And why didn't FaceTime take off?
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.300]   I mean, I know a lot of people who have iPhone 4s.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.020]   I have an iPhone 4, and all of my family have iPhone 4s.
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.780]   And we don't use it.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.460]   And a lot of us are connected to Wi-Fi most of the time,
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.260]   and we don't use it.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.180]   I don't think a lot of people do.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.300]   So will people use this as video for the masses,
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.580]   a little too intrusive?
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.220]   Or is it that FaceTime in its current incarnation
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.460]   is too clunky to use?
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.540]   I mean, I'm curious as to what people think as to why
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.300]   it hasn't gotten more traction.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.820]   I have a theory on that.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.500]   And my basic theory and the statistics
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.260]   show that teenagers and younger generation
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.100]   are making less phone calls, and they're doing more texting.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.820]   And texting is less intrusive.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.340]   You can respond to when you want to.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.140]   Phone call interrupts, whatever you're doing,
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.620]   you have to respond, that type of thing.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.740]   And a video calls even more intrusive,
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.980]   because you had to stop that.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.220]   But you also had to be holding the thing looking at the camera
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.660]   rather than you can't be doodling on the side or something.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.340]   I have to say, Facebook chat is intrusive.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.220]   Whenever I go to a Facebook page, 20 people
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:17.980]   try to chat with me.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.860]   And I just go, oh god, I forgot to turn it off.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.260]   I mean, anything that interrupts you is intrusive.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.700]   Chat can be very intrusive.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.780]   Oh, so really, I think who's going to use this is kind of--
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.340]   just it's going to be, I want to see the grandkids.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.860]   I'll make an appointment with you.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.380]   I will call you tomorrow night.
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.260]   Let's see the grandkids.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.820]   It's going to be more that, isn't it?
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.500]   I hope so.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.420]   That's a good view so that--
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.660]   That's a very good use of it.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.220]   I doubt very much that Ray and I will talk to each other
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.900]   on Facebook using Skype.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.700]   I hope you don't.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.900]   No, I don't think so.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:46.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.740]   If it was the sounds of it, you would never accept it.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.620]   I'm never going to accept it.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.620]   I forgot to turn it off.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:51.460]   Oh, man.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.340]   So now I see now everybody knows when they
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.980]   try to chat with me on Facebook with my--
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.620]   and I'm going, oh god, I forgot to turn it off.
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.500]   Well, it's kind of a surprise because you're going there
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.580]   just to check Facebook briefly.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.540]   And then somebody starts to chat.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:03.980]   It's like, crap.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.460]   And the first time, you have to download that little Java
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.740]   applet that runs it.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.900]   I mean, when was the last time you had to download a Java
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.100]   applet to do something?
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.060]   Oh, you're talking about the new Skype, yeah.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.060]   It's a lot easier.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:15.900]   And also--
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:16.220]   No.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.140]   Java or Flash?
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.380]   It's Java.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.860]   You saw that recording was Flash.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.380]   So the input, I guess, for the recording of the message
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.220]   is Flash.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:27.020]   But the Skype part is a Java-- is a jar file on the Mac
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.980]   and the exe file that loads a jar file on the PC.
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.180]   Yeah, they've had that video message recording feature
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.140]   for a little while.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.300]   That's the old one.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:35.820]   OK.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.260]   Yeah, post to people's Facebook walls, videos,
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.300]   of yourself talking stuff.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.340]   The Skype is something completely new,
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.180]   which they had one Facebook engineer working with the Skype
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.300]   team to build.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.380]   So you heard that they'd been doing this for a year, Mark?
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.300]   Yeah, well, the talks have been happening for a year.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:45:00.500]   And the talks actually heated up once Microsoft bought Skype.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.500]   I think he--
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.500]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.820]   So it wasn't something they had done.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.500]   And then Microsoft came along after the fact
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.140]   that was kind of a trigger.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.180]   Well, they had been talking for a long time.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.980]   But Microsoft has a very deep, long time relationship
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:15.580]   with Facebook.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.260]   They're an investor in Facebook.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:21.020]   And I think Tony Bates said at the news conference
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:25.420]   that I think it was the day of the announcement that Microsoft
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.780]   was buying Skype.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.940]   The Skype executives went down to Facebook,
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.780]   met with Mark Zuckerberg to reaffirm
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.620]   that they're excited about this partnership
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.620]   and they want to keep it moving.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:38.180]   Yeah, and Mark Zuckerberg said that once we heard about this deal,
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.620]   we had more confidence as if they didn't maybe
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.380]   have enough confidence in Skype to begin with.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.100]   But once they knew that Microsoft was involved,
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.900]   the server is and so forth.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.820]   You were great, Ben Pahr.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.980]   You asked Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.580]   So what do you think of Google+, someone had to ask it?
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:53.180]   It was great.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.180]   I think you-- maybe I've imagined it,
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.180]   but it felt like you got a round of applause.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.380]   I think you got a virtual round of applause.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.260]   Hope so.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.220]   I don't know.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.340]   Well, this is the weird thing.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.940]   We all know that Mark Zuckerberg is the number one most
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:12.780]   followed person, not on Facebook, on Google social net--
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.380]   I see you on that list, Leo.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.500]   Yeah, I wasn't going to mention that.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.700]   But Mark has 110,000 followers now.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:23.900]   He's almost twice Larry Page and definitely twice
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.980]   Sergey Brin, the founders of Google.
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.220]   Scobles number four.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.140]   That just tells you how silly these lists are.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.420]   But he also has the most friends.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.820]   He follows a lot of people.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:39.140]   So you said, Mark, what do you think of Google+?
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.140]   What was his response?
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.940]   Well, he did the dance.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.140]   You know, he did it.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.180]   But he did it so elegantly.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.940]   He's become much better at the dance.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:50.500]   But he essentially got to the point of, like, this is all
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.220]   just reforming our vision of the past five years
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.100]   of growing social networks and layers.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.700]   The next five years, just using this social layer that's
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.820]   been built to do amazing things like video chats
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.260]   and applications and all those kind of things.
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.420]   So he danced around it.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.580]   He did it very diplomatically.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.860]   But who would be surprised?
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.900]   The only difference is that on Google+
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.580]   you can't be on there kind of privately.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.140]   But of course, it makes sense that Mark's
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.580]   going to check out the competition.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:19.100]   Don't you think that Larry and Sergey and Vic are on Facebook?
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.260]   I mean, they're all on Twitter.
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.260]   I mean, what's the surprise here?
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.060]   Of course he's on there.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.060]   What's the surprise to me, though,
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.940]   is how many people are following him?
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.180]   Like, you join Google+ and you follow Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.660]   It's like, that's what you do.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.740]   Out of this entire list, he's the only one who's
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.540]   been the subject of a movie.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.220]   Well, if we scroll down just a little bit,
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.660]   you'll see Mashable News.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.660]   You'll see Notch, the creator of--
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.980]   what's your macollet?
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:48.480]   What is it?
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.540]   The Minecraft.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.020]   The Minecraft.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:51.980]   Felicia Day.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.860]   She's an actress.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.060]   Now, that's true.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.020]   She's the movie.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:55.940]   The movie is celeb right now.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.140]   Gina Trapani right after her.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:02.260]   And then number 13, Tom Anderson of Myspace.
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.620]   And by the way, his tagline is enjoying being retired.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.860]   He's been one of the most engaged people on Google+.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.020]   He's really posting a lot.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.060]   He's fun to follow.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.460]   I actually thought he was working for Google there for a while.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.740]   He acts kind of deceptive, isn't it?
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.900]   Marissa Myers on the list.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.980]   Jeff Jarvis, Mike Harrington.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.860]   There's Pete Cashmore of Mashable.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.060]   You're on the list, aren't you, Ben?
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.900]   I'm at like 38 or something.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:25.460]   What is it?
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.540]   Every time?
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.660]   Is it something men do we measure?
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.460]   Is it something-- why is it every time?
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.900]   This social network--
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.100]   every time we got to--
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:34.980]   Oh, who's bigger?
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.140]   I'm not going to go there.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:39.100]   I'm bigger, but I'm growing.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.420]   Not as big as Mark, but I'm growing.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.180]   Take pills for that, Leo.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.860]   Great article in New York.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.380]   Really?
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:49.100]   There's a great article in the New York Times
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.100]   by Nick Bilton about Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.700]   Apparently, when he's got somebody who really wants to hire,
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.780]   he says, let's take a walk.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.900]   And they walk through the parking lot at Facebook,
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.460]   and they go up to the mountain.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.980]   They go up a hiking trail to a hill
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.260]   that overlooks all of Silicon Valley.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.020]   And then he goes, see, there's Apple.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.500]   There's Google.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.660]   How'd you like to be a part of all this?
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.500]   All this could be yours.
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.420]   And then literally, he says, I got the papers back
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.540]   at the office if you'd like to sign up.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.140]   I've heard some interesting hiring stories from Facebook.
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.020]   Have you?
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.940]   Yeah, he will go to great lengths to get people that he wants.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.100]   Well, it's a battle in Silicon Valley right now.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.780]   Facebook does seem to be winning that battle.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.180]   They've got a lot of Googlers have gone over there.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.620]   In fact, another article in the New Yorker magazine
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:37.580]   about Cheryl Sandberg, who's the CEO of--
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.060]   The presidency of SELO.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.540]   Chief operating officer of Facebook,
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:47.140]   talking about how competitive it is.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:51.860]   And there was some question about her involvement in that,
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.100]   because of course, she was a big wig at Google,
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.500]   one of the first employees at Google.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:59.420]   And in that article, a Googler, not named,
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.700]   says she's persona non-grata at Google,
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.060]   because we feel she's stealing engineers.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.460]   She's using her inside knowledge.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:09.020]   They even said she knows that it takes three weeks
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.700]   to get hired at Google, the process.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:15.300]   So that's why Facebook's process is two weeks,
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.460]   because we want to give them the offer first.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.740]   It's very competitive.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.980]   If the truth, it's very smart.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:22.700]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.660]   The competition.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.020]   I mean--
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.020]   Is it rough?
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.780]   Yeah, but I can see why Zuckerberg does it.
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.980]   Can you just imagine being some 20-something engineer?
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.260]   Oh, God.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.700]   Yes.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.780]   All this someday will be yours, my son.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.660]   But you know what's going to change?
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.260]   And this is why Steve Jobs is planning the spacecraft
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.820]   in Cupertino, because now when Mark Zuckerberg goes up
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.940]   in the hill, he's like, what the hell is that?
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.820]   I want to work there.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.660]   I want to work there.
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:48.980]   That looks nice down there.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.820]   There's not a single piece of straight glass on that building.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.220]   The thing is, if you go up there with Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.820]   and he does all this can be yours,
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.860]   and I've got the papers back at the office,
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.780]   and if you say yes right there, he doesn't hire you,
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.180]   because he knows you don't.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.700]   That's the Zappos model, right?
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.220]   That's right.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:05.580]   That's a Zappos model.
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.100]   They put you through the Zappos training,
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.020]   the executive training, and then at the end of it,
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.340]   they offer you-- it's going up.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.420]   It was, I think, $5,000 not to take the job.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.980]   And they figure anybody will take the money.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.380]   We don't want them anyway.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.980]   See ya.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:18.260]   All right.
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.900]   We're going to--
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:23.900]   Someday, all this will be yours.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.900]   We're going to take a break.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:26.820]   Come back just a bit.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.700]   Great panel with us.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.860]   Ben Parr, so good to have you.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.820]   Finally, I've been a fan for so long and mashable.
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.380]   You're doing such a great job over there.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:34.860]   Thank you.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.380]   Really, really appreciate your showing up.
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.060]   And Ray Slikensky, nice to see you again.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.460]   Nice to have some actual people in the studio today.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.500]   Before we continue on, let me mention our good friends
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.780]   at carbonite.com.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:50.860]   Talking about friends, carbonite is the way to back up.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.420]   I think about Francis Ford Coppola,
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.140]   what I think about carbonite.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:59.420]   Great film director, 20 years of screenplays
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.140]   on his hard drive.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.020]   He was living in Argentina.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.820]   He was backing up to a second hard drive right next.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.860]   There's computer external drive plugged in.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.100]   Thieves broke in.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.260]   They stole the computer.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.660]   They stole his hard drive.
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.460]   I remember reading this story about a year ago.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.060]   Tragic.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.500]   He said, that's 20 years worth of work.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.620]   It's gone.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.060]   I had a backup, but it's gone.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.260]   When the worst happens, you're going
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.500]   to wish you had a backup off site.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.820]   That's so important in the cloud.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.300]   And this is what carbonite does.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.740]   Mac or PC, you go to carbonite.com right now
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.780]   and use the offer code to it.
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.220]   You'll be installing it for 15 days free.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:34.900]   Now immediately what happens is,
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.900]   when you're not using your computer but you're online,
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.180]   it'll start just kind of backing up your data.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.380]   When it does that first full backup from then on,
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.820]   you just are always backed up.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.220]   It's not like I'll back up on Sunday.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.500]   It's all the time.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.820]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.300]   You don't have to think about how much either
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.140]   because it's unlimited backup for every bit
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.180]   of your personal data on the internal drive.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.020]   You can't start plugging in drives,
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.860]   but on the internal drive.
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:57.660]   And it's always there.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.820]   You can even access it.
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.460]   You don't have to wait for a disaster online.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.220]   It's cloud storage.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.580]   So you can log onto your carbonite account
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:07.380]   on any computer, on your smartphone, blackberry phone.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.940]   And there's your stuff.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.580]   It's all there waiting for you.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.820]   And so easy to restore should the disaster happen.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:16.060]   Or should you upgrade to a new computer,
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.620]   you just log onto your carbonite account
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.700]   on the new computer, press restore and you're done.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.660]   So try it free.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:26.060]   Use the offer code twit carbonite.com if you decide to buy.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.020]   It's $59 a year.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.700]   That's about $0.16 a day.
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.180]   And what they're going to do is they're
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.300]   going to add an additional two months to your 12 month
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:38.220]   subscription if you use the offer code twit.
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.060]   These are great guys.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.660]   They just-- you'll like this ray.
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:46.300]   They just-- I think their support team was in India.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:48.740]   It was offshore support.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.620]   And they kept looking at the results again.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.580]   They finally said, we're going to move them back.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.220]   They just hired 150 people in Lewiston, Maine.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:55.660]   Nice.
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.060]   They do all their support.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.660]   I think that's really nice.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:02.100]   Nothing against-- if you're an Indian company,
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.540]   use Indian support people.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.820]   I'm not saying that.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.660]   Nothing wrong with it.
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:06.660]   But if you're an American company,
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.540]   I think it's nice to use local people.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.220]   And they found that really people were getting, frankly,
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.420]   better support from the people who really were right there.
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:15.540]   So that's, I think, really great.
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.380]   Carbonite.com, offer code twit.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.660]   And we really thank them for their support.
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.300]   But yeah, people, we've been selling these bricks.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:26.300]   A lot of our sponsors now are buying the logo bricks.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:28.780]   So when we have the wall of honor in there,
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.300]   isn't that pretty where that's going to be?
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.140]   And when you come in the lobby, you'll see it.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:32.580]   It's right there.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.900]   I'll show you Ben after the show.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.420]   But we've got two rows of these logo bricks going all the way
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:36.940]   down there.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.180]   So it's really--
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.340]   She's letting you expand the wall.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.460]   Yeah, we had to.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:42.660]   We sold 1,000.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:43.100]   Wow.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.820]   200 of these, but 1,000 total.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.900]   And thank you, because--
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.340]   well, let me show you.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.020]   I got nothing left.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.460]   It's all empty pockets.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.140]   We spent every penny on this new studio,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.020]   but it was worth it, it really is.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.620]   So Leo, what's going to happen to the twit cottage?
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.660]   What is going to become of your original--
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:05.300]   It's exciting.
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.580]   We've got this big wrecking ball,
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.900]   and we're just going to go womb.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.020]   No, we don't own the building.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.020]   We don't even know either building.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.180]   We're leasing it.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:17.420]   So we're just going to move out, and somebody else will move in.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:18.500]   It'll be kind of sad.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.940]   We've been getting tons of visitors over the last month
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.980]   or two for people who say, I want
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.980]   to see it before it's over.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.580]   But man, this place--
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.540]   You get historic landmark status for it.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.620]   It's such a dump.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.020]   I don't think so.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.540]   And somebody-- this is good.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.380]   Somebody said, just said to me, you
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.540]   don't want logos on the ISS, but you're
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.540]   going to have logos all over your building.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.460]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.340]   If the government would like to support Twit--
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.740]   no, I don't want them.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:45.940]   Support Twit at all.
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.260]   So the Nortell patents--
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.540]   I think we talked about this last week.
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:53.060]   They've gone not to Google who bid for them--
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:58.840]   $3.14159 billion, but they went to Apple, Blackberries,
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.500]   Rim, and Microsoft.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.820]   So how long been par before we get the lawsuits?
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.900]   When are the lawsuits on Android?
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.260]   Any minute now.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:09.620]   Oh, you think?
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.140]   I mean, obviously, they already started,
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.540]   but that's how--
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.540]   apparently, that's how--
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.460]   They got the hammer.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.380]   And Microsoft's make a whole bunch of money
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.300]   on every Android device sold.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.300]   They just--
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.820]   They want to make-- it's not the money now.
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.500]   They want to kill it.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.300]   What did you think?
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.620]   I definitely think so.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.540]   It's not-- it's Oracle.
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.460]   It's Microsoft and all of them.
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.540]   And really, that consortium went for those patents.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.940]   I mean, it was a defensive move to make sure
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:32.820]   that Google didn't have them.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:36.820]   And Google didn't have the defense against its platform.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:41.340]   500-- Google says we're activating 500,000 Android.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.580]   I'm a big Android fan.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.140]   Ray, have you still Apple?
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.420]   Yeah, I can't--
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.100]   I don't know.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.780]   I just can't stand the Android anymore.
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.780]   Come on, play with this.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.660]   It's a G2X.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:50.580]   You're going to like it.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.380]   Look at-- they've got the weather in the background there.
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.260]   I got all these widgets.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.780]   I think you might be the widget that I don't like.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:58.940]   Well, you can-- you know, if you want--
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.140]   you know, if you don't have to like widgets,
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:04.820]   if you want Ray, you could just make it an array of icons
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:05.220]   on there.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:08.380]   It can look just like an iPhone.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.100]   Although, when the screen is locked--
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.100]   It does look like an iPhone.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:11.740]   I do like that.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.060]   Because I can see my staff.
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.140]   What do you got there, Mark Millian?
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.500]   What are you holding up there?
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.860]   iOS 5.
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.460]   Oh, see, that's nice.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:22.460]   We just like an Android phone.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:23.060]   Just like this.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.300]   They sold a good feature.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:24.740]   The one--
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:26.620]   The notifications are spectacular.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:27.100]   Yeah.
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.460]   And the widgets in the--
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.140]   Well, you can eyes in the notification system.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.420]   When the screen is locked.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.420]   Hey, Ray, you did the tip.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.260]   I left it the water street piece, Drew.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.980]   Great quiche.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:38.940]   Awesome quiche.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:40.620]   It was great.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.420]   That's something you can't do on an Apple phone.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.140]   For some reason, 4-square added these little notifications
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.620]   to Android first.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:48.460]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:49.580]   So it notified me.
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.140]   Nice.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:50.620]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.380]   You tried the quiche.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.740]   It was very good quiche.
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:55.740]   That's pretty funny.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.060]   Well, why do we always talk about food on these things?
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:58.460]   What?
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.100]   Why do we always talk about food on these things?
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.300]   Because I'm hungry.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.700]   By the day of the day, I'm starving.
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:05.340]   Best quiche in town.
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.100]   Congrats, you've done this.
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.660]   And the bread that they give beforehand--
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.700]   Best bread I've ever had.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.140]   Apple, according to an analyst, Apple
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.660]   makes 50% of all handset industry profits.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.740]   See, Apple's doing all right.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.820]   We don't have to feel sorry for Apple here.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.700]   Then not only the ticket--
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.260]   Apple is the-- although Android is the most
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.940]   used mobile operating system, smartphone operating system,
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:34.260]   the iPhone is the most sold handset of any of the--
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:34.780]   OK, I'm confused.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:35.780]   --in the individual handset.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:38.700]   So that kind of makes sense to a certain--
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:39.420]   to a large extent.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.140]   It's both four models.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.540]   Because there's four iPhones.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.900]   But there's 4,000 Android phones.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.380]   Right.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:46.660]   But there are different businesses.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.500]   I mean, Apple is deriving all of its revenue
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:53.540]   from the hardware sales, whereas Google is doing this for free
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:56.100]   so that they can get all this money from mobile ad revenue.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.260]   Right.
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.740]   So this is market share.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.100]   Android, I love this.
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.500]   2008, Android market share.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:05.540]   0.6-- or I'm sorry, 0.5%.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:09.420]   2009, 3.9%, 2010, 22%.
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.340]   First quarter to 2011, 31%.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:18.580]   Now 42% projected to be 50% by the end of 2012.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:23.620]   And Apple going kind of pretty stable at about 15% to 18%
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:24.860]   of the market share.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:25.360]   It's rim.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.700]   That's really taking the big--
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.540]   Ribs the one that's dying.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:29.380]   Look at that.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:30.860]   It's just sad.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.860]   Are you a blackberry fan?
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.380]   I'm an iPhone person, but it just had--
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.220]   Well, look at Symbian.
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.580]   Symbian ain't doing too well either.
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:42.860]   52% in 2008 projected to be 9% in 2012.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.980]   Well, in the surprise, they threw it under the bus.
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:46.420]   And then Windows--
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:51.020]   And Windows Mobile is not doing well either despite the Windows
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.700]   phone 7.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.380]   It just isn't taking off.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.860]   They're still sinking like a stove.
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:57.660]   4.9% market share in the second quarter.
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.060]   I wouldn't rule them out yet.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.580]   I'm curious to see what happens to you.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.940]   No, no, you could change everything.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.580]   Anybody here use a Windows phone?
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.300]   I've used them.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.620]   I own a focus.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.060]   It's not like the interface itself.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:12.660]   Like, I can see.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.580]   I like it.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:16.540]   Yeah, like, you know, non-techers are like, you know,
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:17.420]   mothers like easier.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.940]   It's a little bit of easier access and stuff.
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.900]   I think it's like my first Sony.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.340]   It's my first smartphone.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:23.340]   Yes.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.180]   I really do.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.620]   I think that's exactly the market for it.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:25.940]   Yep.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.300]   Yep.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:29.220]   My first smartphone.
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.460]   And there's a huge number of people who've not done it.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.340]   I mean, I think what?
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:35.540]   Only a third in the US of cell phone owners
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.500]   have smartphones.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.940]   Lots of room for growth.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.180]   Lots of room.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.500]   And it's a great operating system.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.140]   I mean, I think they've stumbled--
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.780]   Microsoft stumbled in not getting key features out faster.
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.940]   But it's a great operating system.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.700]   And it'll be real interesting to see
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.220]   how it integrates with Windows 8.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.740]   We were talking about the new iPhone this fall.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.620]   Wall Street Journal's saying that Apple expects
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.300]   to make 25 million units of the new iPhone for this year alone.
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.460]   Well, that's amazing.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.220]   I mean, so you can't-- really, nobody's out of the market.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:14.100]   Certainly, Apple's going strong and Android strong.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.180]   I think there's still hope for Windows.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.660]   Really, the loser is Blackberry.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.540]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.540]   And as I said, I live in rim countries.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.100]   Right.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.340]   You're right up there by Waterloo.
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.660]   Yeah, it's a 20-minute drive from you.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.180]   And it's all--
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.740]   WebOS, anybody?
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.140]   Well, what do you think, Mark?
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.540]   The touchpad-- people have been disappointed by the touchpad.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.140]   Did you play with one?
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.260]   Yeah, we've got a touchpad here.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.020]   I'm also in the disappointing camp, I think.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.900]   I mean, it looks like they haven't
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.380]   done a whole lot with the operating system
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.660]   in the last couple of years.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:46.700]   And I think they've lost a lot of their best designers
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:50.900]   and a lot of their best engineers to Apple and Google
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.780]   and the hotter companies in the mobile space
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.940]   and the transition from Palm to HP.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:00.540]   So I mean, they still make pretty good hardware
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.340]   and they still make pretty good software,
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.420]   but it's not outstanding in any way.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.380]   I think that HP putting WebOS on all its printers
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:14.900]   and computers and then trying to lease it out
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.460]   to other manufacturers could be an interesting play.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.100]   But it's going to take a while before they
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.820]   can do anything with that software.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:23.420]   That's a shame.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.780]   I loved WebOS.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:28.780]   I actually thought the Palm Prix was a great start,
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.380]   anyway, underpowered, but a great start.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.900]   It's a little bit disappointing.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.980]   So RIM might be out.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.740]   Nokia is going to be around.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.580]   We'll see what the Windows--
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.860]   there's a competitive market there.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.460]   We can't really-- in five years or not,
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.620]   it could be cold, new players.
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:46.100]   I mean, just think five years ago, there was no iPhone.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.740]   There was no Android two years, three years ago.
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.260]   It's changed world.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.420]   The world is changing way too fast.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.140]   One thing I know you don't want to do--
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:59.740]   sneak spy software onto Apple computers
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:00.740]   at the Apple Store.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.340]   Apparently not a good idea.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:03.700]   The guy--
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.780]   I love this story.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.980]   Well, tell me this story.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:06.860]   Tell me this story.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.420]   So this one was from Mashable Sir, Kessler, and she--
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.300]   there was just--
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.340]   I guess artists in New York, and he decided to put spyware
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:21.580]   on all these different Apple devices in all the New York
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.620]   stores and take pictures of these people while they were
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:25.180]   looking at it.
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.900]   And then I think he had a showing in an Apple store
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.380]   where you would see all these different people,
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.820]   including yourself.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.140]   Looking at the computer.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.220]   It's a clever idea.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.100]   Apple has sicked the Secret Service on them.
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.620]   I know.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.620]   I was like, the Secret Service ticked the--
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:40.540]   That's serious now.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.420]   They're pissed.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.580]   So is this the video that he made?
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.060]   Or this is his story.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.860]   This is from the Mashable story.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.620]   Yeah, I think this is a video.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:54.220]   I have a thousand photos using computers around New York City.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.260]   So here's a saw-- oh, so this is a software install.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.740]   Yeah, this is some of the people that--
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.980]   I like this.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.540]   But of course, you can't do that.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.100]   It's a cool idea.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:07.300]   You kind of take the wrong company to tangle with you.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.700]   I mean, they allow I Justine to dance around, but really.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.740]   Oh, I Justine isn't installing any spyware on their computers.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.100]   No.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.060]   This is kind of cool, though.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.180]   Look at this.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.300]   He's an artist.
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.020]   It reminds me of that software that you put on your computer
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:27.700]   prey to take pictures of the person who stole it.
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.140]   Right.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:28.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:29.940]   Right.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.500]   From Orbequeul.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.020]   Right.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:38.900]   So he arranged a public exhibition of these photos
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:39.860]   at an Apple store.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.140]   Yeah, at an Apple store.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.340]   When he says, "arranged," does he mean he actually
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.060]   talked to management at the Apple store?
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.700]   I think he only talked to the security people who
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.820]   were like, am I allowed--
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:52.820]   can I take pictures?
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.580]   And they said, yes.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.420]   And he didn't say, by the way, put his spyware.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.780]   Your software, your cameras.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.620]   Wow.
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.580]   Well, I'm glad he made the book.
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.940]   It looks like he's using a legit camcorder.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.540]   I mean, he's got a good zoom go, and he's not filming this
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.420]   on an iPhone in the store.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:08.780]   So--
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.300]   He's an artist.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.740]   Yeah, but I'm saying the Apple store employee
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.700]   should have noticed that he would be cameras.
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.500]   They should have picked up cameras.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:15.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.020]   Now here he is.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.540]   He's taking over the--
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.780]   He's taking over the computer.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.500]   Hey, that's me.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:26.020]   This is pretty funny.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:26.980]   I could see how pissed.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.540]   I could just see Steve Jobs coming, hurtling down the hall,
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.260]   saying, who the hell is this guy?
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.940]   Oh, man.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.340]   All right.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.820]   So we'll find out what happens.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.420]   Kyle McDonald, good luck.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:42.300]   And if you need money for your fund, call NASA.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.460]   You should consult his Moto for legal advice.
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.900]   Gizmodo, yeah.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.380]   Come on.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.980]   Go, Brian Lamb.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:48.580]   Oh, he quit.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.260]   Yeah, he quit.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.140]   He's gone.
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.460]   You know where he's going?
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.300]   He didn't announce when-- he didn't announce.
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.860]   I don't really know what he's going to do next.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.260]   He left.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.500]   He went to surf, I think.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.860]   I think he's just going off to surf.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:58.860]   Surfing?
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:00.860]   He likes to surf.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:02.540]   All right, who thinks we're going to get
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:04.660]   Lion this week?
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.340]   Yay.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:05.980]   You think so?
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.500]   I think so.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:06.940]   I think so.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:07.740]   I think Thursday.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.860]   Thursday, Mark, you agree?
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.220]   Yeah, it'll probably-- I mean, it's not a big release.
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:15.660]   So it'll come in the next couple weeks, I'm sure.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.420]   I don't think they'll make a big hoopla out of it.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.740]   Well, no, but that's the-- we know it's this month.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.740]   But some people are saying it's this week.
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.420]   It's going to come at the same time as the MacBook Airs.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.980]   And if the MacBook Air rumors are true,
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.860]   then it will be sometime this week.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:30.940]   Jesus says it's not the future we were hoping for.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.740]   That's Jesus Diaz on--
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.180]   Just kidding me to confuse you.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:36.900]   Jesus.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.260]   Jesus says, forget it.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.420]   How was all I'm prossing for a second?
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.220]   I don't know.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.740]   I'm pretty excited.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.740]   Have any of you played with it?
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.740]   I haven't played with it.
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:49.700]   I haven't played with it.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.580]   But the description that he gives
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.620]   is kind of what I was afraid of when
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.940]   they were describing it at the launch event for it.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:01.180]   They were talking about how it's iOS on top of Mac OS.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.220]   I was kind of thinking, that sounds Frankensteinian.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:07.100]   It sounds like they've grafted something.
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.580]   He used to phrase the mission chaos.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:09.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.700]   And it seems to me like that's--
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.540]   I saw some reference to it as like,
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.100]   this could be Apple's Vista.
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.580]   And I don't know whether they're going to be able to do that far.
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.580]   But it does sound like it's clunky,
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.700]   like it's not seamless as it should be.
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.620]   But it could be also that that's because it's not
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:30.820]   yet on the hardware that they envision it being on.
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:34.620]   Imagine if you did have touchscreen iMacs that say,
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:38.380]   laid down when you wanted to use them like a touchscreen.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.420]   It could be a lot more friendly then.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:43.580]   But I think if you're using the gestures on a touchpad
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.700]   and with a magic mouse, I'm not sure
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.380]   that that sounds like it would work well.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.420]   One of the things he says, the ugly failure
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.740]   of the physical metaphor-- this is Jesus Diaz writing--
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.540]   another iOS aspect that has worked its way into line
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.860]   is the graphical emulation of physical surfaces.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.180]   Now there's gross faux wood paneling and photo booth.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:08.100]   The address book is a real world hardbound address book.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.660]   I, Cal, is a bloody pseudo calendar made of paper and leather.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.100]   The question is why is Apple reproducing things
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.460]   that are obsolete already?
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.460]   Does anyone under 18 even know what these things are?
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.100]   Let's ask our kid.
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.100]   Mark Millie.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.140]   How long are you Mark?
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.220]   Anyway, they do the same thing with the iPad.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:31.780]   I mean, it's just kind of like a cute thing that they do.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.700]   I like it, but I'm an old fart.
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:39.420]   And I do wonder, I mean, isn't this kind of antiquated?
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:40.940]   Yeah, I mean, I think they're just
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:47.100]   going for nice bubbly design that appeals to your senses of,
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.780]   ooh, that looks kind of cool.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.380]   It's like leather.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.180]   I've used the pre-release version of Lion.
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:56.780]   And I mean, they really should have called it desert leopard
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:59.940]   or something, because it's the same incremental step
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.180]   that they took with no leopard.
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.780]   It's very little, but it's new.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.700]   OK.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.420]   Well, and the good news is it's $30.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.420]   You could download it from the App Store,
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.060]   put it on every machine.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.980]   I mean, it's not like they're asking for $129 for it.
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:15.460]   To me, it feels like this is just like a mid-stage,
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.780]   just like a prep stage for the next version.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.220]   We said that last time.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.460]   We said that snow leopard was a prep stage for the next version.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.300]   I think they've just moved--
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.940]   they don't work in a very centralized team environment.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:29.620]   There's not much of like, this is the Mac team,
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.500]   and this will always be the Mac team.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:36.340]   Their engineers go back and forth between products.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:41.300]   And I think they've shifted a lot of their resources to iOS.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:46.060]   So I think they're, to an extent, giving up
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.340]   on doing big innovations on the desktop,
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.660]   just because the iOS is becoming a giant part of their business.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.420]   And there's so much more to do there.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.740]   Good sound in our chat room says the next version should be
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.500]   "putty-tat."
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:06.820]   When do they go to OS 11?
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.500]   I don't know.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.140]   And please, will they not use the marketing term?
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.180]   It goes to 11.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.180]   Please don't know.
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:13.700]   No, they don't.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:14.180]   They wouldn't.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:15.460]   That would be an idea.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:16.700]   That would be terrible.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.900]   Random aside, I miss when I talk to my cousin
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.260]   and talk about Looney Tunes.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.660]   What's Looney Tunes?
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.260]   No, please.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:25.940]   They don't know?
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.540]   They don't know.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:27.540]   It's today.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.940]   Even my son knows what Looney Tunes is, and he's five.
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.980]   You just have an ignorant cousin.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.940]   I hope so, because I love Looney Tunes.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.260]   Wait, did I just say that?
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.620]   Looney Tunes are still around.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.780]   You did a very credible--
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.860]   Looney Tunes on the cartoon channel?
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.020]   Yeah, I'm sure they're on YouTube, right, Mark?
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:44.500]   That's how I--
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.020]   Oh, sure.
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:50.540]   I saw that on YouTube.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.380]   Isn't this, in a way, though, what Microsoft's doing
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.380]   with Windows 8, at least what we've seen of Windows 8?
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.820]   It looks like they're gluing a tablet interface
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.740]   on top of an operating system.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.860]   This might be the thing--
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.900]   I have to say, I bet you both these companies, Apple and Microsoft,
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.100]   are desperately casting around to figure out, well, what
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.740]   can you do to an operating system that's new and different?
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.940]   We kind of got it down.
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:13.700]   I mean, there's no real reason to change, is there?
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.060]   Are we done?
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:20.340]   I mean, the real reason to put that Windows phone 7 type
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.300]   mosaic interface is because they're
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.940]   taking the desktop windows and scaling it into tablet.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.860]   I mean, those changes are designed
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:32.660]   for the tablet devices that people are going to--
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:33.500]   But they will appear on the desktop.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.700]   --at Apple's not doing that.
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.340]   But they will appear on the desktop.
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:38.060]   They'll appear on the desktop, and maybe it'll
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:42.140]   be good for grandma who gets her cheap Windows netbook,
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:46.300]   and she can see big tiles and figure out what everything is.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.140]   But those changes are really done for the tablet devices.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.060]   And Apple--
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.940]   they've gone the other way.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:56.620]   They've said our mobile OS--
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:59.340]   our OS phones is also for tablets.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.860]   And it just doesn't really make a whole lot of sense
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:05.380]   to put all of that touch stuff onto the desktop for the Mac.
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:08.320]   But we'll see.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.220]   I don't want to get--
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.700]   I got in such heat because Devorak came on about a month ago
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.900]   and was slamming Windows 8.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.900]   We just got nothing but hate mail from--
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.420]   I need to play with that thing in my hands
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.300]   before I make a decision.
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.660]   Yeah, it's too-- way too early.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.340]   But I also want to raise this as a way of criticizing Microsoft.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:27.700]   But just wondering if maybe we're casting around
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:30.780]   for something new, some idea, because operating systems
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.340]   are kind of--
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.580]   I mean, the iPad, that's the new idea.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:37.460]   The iPhone, the touchscreen, that's the new idea.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:38.660]   The desktop.
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.740]   I don't know if there's anything more to say about it.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:42.540]   Is there?
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.500]   No, I don't think so.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.540]   I mean, for me, it's just a development machine.
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.500]   I do any browsing or--
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.500]   So you agree with the job, sir?
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:48.860]   --and the job, sir.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.860]   And the job's there.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.100]   Some people will still need a pickup, but most people don't.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.900]   Well, I don't think you'll ever develop an application
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.100]   on an iPad ever.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.620]   The interfaces--
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620]   Right.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.580]   --for large amounts of typing.
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.900]   If you did, it would be painful.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.700]   I don't buy that job's analogy.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.340]   If it's a truck, then why are they
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.060]   trying to put six seats inside of it,
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.620]   and why are they trying to develop it?
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.380]   It's an eight-cup holders.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.180]   They need to figure out if it's a truck,
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.140]   and it's going to lose its mainstream significance,
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.180]   but still be important to a small sec,
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.860]   then don't drastically change things.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.500]   What they did with Final Cut Pro X,
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:35.220]   that just pissed off a lot of the truck drivers.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:40.740]   Are you saying that touches the cup holders of the desktop?
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:41.660]   I think that's good.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:42.860]   I like it.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:43.300]   Say it.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.700]   See that.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:49.700]   So we asked our audience on Google Plus, where else?
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.380]   Because we're basically little fanboys here.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:57.660]   For their suggestions, for stories, for today's show--
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:58.180]   and you know what?
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:00.220]   They came up-- a lot of them--
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:03.260]   Nikola Tesla's 150th, fifth birthday.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:04.220]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.580]   They came up with one that was actually something probably
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:10.340]   I wouldn't have heard about, and I'm really grateful.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:14.740]   So we thank-- let me get the name so I can tell you
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.580]   who thought this one up.
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:22.580]   Jamie Diamond on G Plus, for pointing to this R's
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:25.260]   Technica article that kind of stunned me,
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:29.140]   major ISPs agreed to six strikes copyright enforcement
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:29.860]   plan.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.260]   Now we've heard about the three strikes
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:34.820]   plan that was proposed by ACTA and adopted in France
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:38.100]   and some other countries, where you have three unproven
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.900]   strikes against you for piracy.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:42.020]   They'll kick you off the internet.
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:46.300]   Well, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Cable Vision, and Time Warner
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.460]   just signed on to a voluntary agreement
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:54.140]   with the movie and music industry to crack down on infringers.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:57.820]   After six strikes, well, you won't exactly be out,
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.940]   but what are they going to do?
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.940]   Spank you?
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.300]   They're going to educate you.
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.740]   They're going to like dial up speeds.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.180]   Yeah, they'll educate.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.820]   You have to go harass you bit by bit.
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.940]   You have to go to a re-education camp.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.140]   They're going to make you watch YouTube videos all day
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.140]   long about privacy.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.340]   That's actually YouTube day.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.420]   Isn't they did that?
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.860]   They make you watch-- if you get dang dinged
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.460]   like a certain three times on YouTube for copyright
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.500]   violations, before you can continue on,
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.780]   you have to go to a copyright school on YouTube.
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.580]   It's like happy animal friends.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:30.380]   I don't know which one.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:31.380]   They got the characters.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:34.860]   Is it actually-- oh, I didn't realize it was actually a real--
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:37.660]   It was-- yeah, it went with one of their YouTube stars.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.900]   Like, I don't remember the name of the one,
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.500]   but they went with these characters that are already
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.500]   very popular.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.940]   Russell learns some important lessons.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.540]   It is his happy tree friends.
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:49.500]   Oh, there it is.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.140]   Russell learns some important lessons about copyright.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:53.500]   Let's all watch together.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.340]   By the way, I'm violating copyright
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.780]   by running this on the show.
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:01.780]   And we will probably get pulled off of YouTube just for this.
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.780]   I was just educating people.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:05.780]   I've been educating--
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:09.780]   Educate Benjamin Cairus with a new video from "Lumpy and the Lumpets."
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.780]   Oh, I like his little pirate hook.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:13.780]   See, he's a pirate.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.780]   He's got a hook and a patch.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.780]   Russell's a huge fan.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.780]   He can't wait to tell his friends.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.780]   Freehouse, he would use that hook and just like--
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.780]   So he was like--
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.780]   Take out the guy's eye, right?
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.780]   You didn't create that video.
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.780]   You just copied someone else's content.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.780]   This is so--
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:29.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.780]   I'm uploading someone else's content.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.780]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.780]   Delete.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.780]   You just copied somebody else's content.
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.780]   If you want to see that video, just watch that.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.780]   If I was forced to watch that, I would never steal content ever again.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:44.780]   You know, I watched it and then I checked the box.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:45.780]   I've learned my lesson.
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.780]   I've learned my lesson.
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.780]   Next time I'll wear an eye patch.
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.780]   This is almost-- these six steps are almost--
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:58.780]   it's almost like they're wimping out.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:04.780]   You read this and you go, "Okay, when are you really going to smack them down?"
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.780]   Right.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:12.780]   And if you're going to agree to something, then this is so amorphous and so we need that.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.780]   They call them copyright alerts.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:19.780]   A series of messages warning users that their alleged activity has been detected.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.780]   Penalties could continue if you could result if you continue.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.780]   Six times you get these messages.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.780]   Yeah, this is the don't make me come up there, kids.
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:31.780]   Don't make me pull up with this internet.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:36.780]   There is an appeals process and then there's the punishment,
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:37.780]   which they don't call punishment.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.780]   They call it a mitigation measure.
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:43.780]   I'm going to-- don't make me open up a mitigation measure on your ass.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.780]   I'm going to come up there.
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:46.780]   You're grounded.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:48.780]   You're grounded.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:49.780]   You're mitigated.
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.780]   Son, it's time for a mitigation measure.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:56.780]   I'm going--
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.780]   So there's a $35 filing fee.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.780]   I can't-- okay, so the first alert, second alert, third alert, fifth alert, sixth alert.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.780]   Where do the alerts go to?
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.780]   How does that even work?
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.780]   Like if I'm bit towarding something, how do they--
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.780]   Okay, so all right, so would you be Mr. Pirate for the purposes of--
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.780]   Sure.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:21.780]   I've never done such a-- I hate this act before, but I'll pretend this for this.
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.780]   Look down that bit, Tori.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.780]   In response to a notice from a copyright owner and internet service provider,
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:30.780]   we'll send an online alert to a subscriber, an email, like so.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:31.780]   An email.
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.780]   Notifying you that your account may have been misused.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.780]   It's a good thing I check my eyes, because you know what counts.
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.780]   And by the way, if it were content theft, that would be wrong.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:50.780]   And a violation of our published policies and that consequences could result from any such conduct.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.780]   It will also direct you to educational resources.
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.780]   In other words, that crappy--
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:58.780]   My happy tree friends.
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:02.780]   Anyway, then the second alert, if it persists, the subscriber may get a second alert,
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:05.780]   which will underscore the educational message.
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:09.780]   So is this like when I count like one, two, if I get it, it's real quick.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.780]   I don't know. Don't make me count.
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.780]   If the subscriber account-- again, this is third strike now.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:15.780]   What?
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.780]   Again appears to have been used for content theft.
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:18.780]   You'll receive another alert.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:24.780]   However, this alert will provide a conspicuous measure, a mechanism, such as a click-through pop-up notice,
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:28.780]   landing page or something like that, asking you to say, "I got that.
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:29.780]   I got it."
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.780]   That's a good punishment.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.780]   They just barrage you with pop-ups.
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:36.780]   This is just to make sure that you got the message.
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.780]   Fourth alert, if you keep doing it,
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.780]   you're going to get another alert.
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:41.780]   Oh, my!
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.780]   Not another alert.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:50.780]   Fifth alert, if the subscriber account again appears-- you got a lot of leeway here.
[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:55.780]   Again, if you've been used for content theft, they'll send you another alert at this.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:20:01.780]   I hope they don't send this to like my-- if I was doing this, and of course I don't.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:07.780]   But if I was doing this and they were to say, "Send it to my ISP email address," which I never use,
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:10.780]   and a lot of people don't use, I would never see these.
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:13.780]   So, okay, by alert five, they can do the mitigation.
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.780]   Now, here's the mitigation measures.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:21.780]   For instance, not limited to, but including temporary reduction of internet speed,
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:26.780]   redirection to a landing page that says, "You can't use internet till you call us."
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.780]   You've been called to the office.
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:35.780]   To discuss the matter or reviews in response to some educational information about copyright,
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:42.780]   ISPs are not obliged to oppose mitigation measures, which would disable or be reasonably likely
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.780]   to be able to subscribe to voice telephone service, email account, or any--
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.780]   So, this is a problem.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.780]   You can't cut somebody off of the internet because you've been selling them internet-based
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:58.780]   phone service for the past six years, or health service, such as home security or medical monitoring.
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.780]   The ISP can wave it.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:01.780]   You could say, "No, no."
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:05.780]   Sixth alert, whether or not the ISP has previously waived the mitigation measure
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:09.780]   if the subscribers account again appears to be used for content theft,
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:12.780]   the ISP will send another alert.
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:16.780]   What happened to number seven?
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:17.780]   We start over.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.780]   It goes back to one.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:24.780]   This is death by a thousand alerts.
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:25.780]   That's what this is.
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.780]   I bet you they just send the letters like, "Please just stop doing this."
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.780]   It's like an actual letter.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:32.780]   We don't want to do this.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.780]   You're making me sad.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:39.780]   So, if you have six things downloading at the same time, so there's six separate--
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.780]   Oh, that's a content violation.
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:43.780]   Do I get like six alerts all at once?
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.780]   No, and that's why you should download as many--
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:46.780]   Okay.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:51.780]   You should have as many downloads as many downloads as you can, because each one is one alert.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.780]   Okay.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:56.780]   So, kids, when you're downloading movies or music from the internet, make sure you download as much as possible,
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.780]   every time.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.780]   I recommend 10 to 20.
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:00.780]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.780]   And you have to be caught too.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.780]   They don't catch people up pretty much ever.
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.780]   I'm looking at Mark Millian.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:10.780]   I think he should get at least two alerts right now.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:14.780]   This is good news for the small ISPs.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:15.780]   Yes.
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:16.780]   All the pirate ships will be--
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:17.780]   That's true.
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:18.780]   It's only the biggest.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:21.780]   All right, let's talk about music.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.780]   Spotify is supposedly--
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:24.780]   Ooh.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.780]   Coming to the US sometime next week.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:27.780]   Does anybody--
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:28.780]   No, I can't use it.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:29.780]   You can't use it.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:30.780]   I'll do it.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.780]   I'll just bow out.
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.780]   You can't use it.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:33.780]   We can't use it.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.780]   Anybody here?
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:35.780]   Have you tried it by--
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:36.780]   I've tried it.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.780]   You can use a proxy.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:38.780]   Oh, Mark Millian, you're raising your hand.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:39.780]   I knew you were a pirate.
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:40.780]   No, no, no.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:41.780]   They hooked me up with it.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:42.780]   They hooked you up.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:43.780]   I got it legitimately--
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.780]   So, look, I use RDO.
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.780]   I've used MOG.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.780]   I've used Rhapsody.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.780]   How is this different from those?
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:55.780]   Well, I mean, it's got a nice design.
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:00.780]   It actually rivals the song catalog.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.780]   But obviously the biggest competitive advantage is that it's going to be free up front.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:13.780]   You go to any college campus and the way that they're listening to music is they're firing up YouTube and typing in each song at a party.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:14.780]   What's wrong with that?
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:16.780]   You get the video and the music and it's free.
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:21.780]   Right, but you know, you can't do playlists easily with that.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.780]   And it's just not a very good experience.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:31.780]   So, Spotify is free and it's a better experience, which is why it's taken off massively in Europe.
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:34.780]   And I think it has a pretty good chance to take off here.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.780]   We got the chat rooms great.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:36.780]   They're saying, "What's got a good beat?
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:37.780]   You can dance to it.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.780]   It's got fins.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.780]   It's got a unicorn."
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:42.780]   It's got a unicorn.
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.780]   I mean, there's all sorts of reasons to like it.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:45.780]   But it's funny.
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:49.780]   It's because we can't get it in the States and Canada that we're so excited about it.
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:50.780]   Is that it?
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.780]   People in Europe love it.
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:55.780]   It's again, it's again, it's the tech world always talks about.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:24:00.780]   I'm wondering what the regular Joe's are because a lot of them are using Last FM or Pandora.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.780]   Are they going to be jumping on to Spotify when they're French to at home?
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:06.780]   I think there's a little bit of a backlash.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.780]   I can't wait a minute.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:12.780]   This is from one of our viewers, the new OS 10 Lion.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:18.780]   At least they didn't put scoble in there.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.780]   That's good.
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.780]   Yes, that's your assignment.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:21.780]   Put scoble in there.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:28.780]   It's the Lion box with the picture of a lion, but instead of a lion face, it's got an
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.780]   icky.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:30.780]   I smell a new meme.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:35.780]   It smells like new meme in here.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.780]   I don't know for me for these music services.
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:40.780]   I'm more interested in the turntable.
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:41.780]   Turntable.fm is amazing.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.780]   It's got $7.5 million.
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.780]   37 million dollar valuation.
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.780]   Turntable.fm is cool.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:50.780]   The internet is not legal.
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:51.780]   It's not legal?
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.780]   No, they don't have any license agreements or anything.
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.780]   They're in the adventure capital.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.780]   They're going to have a long road ahead of them.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:04.780]   Spotify has been negotiating to get to the US for over a year and a half.
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:09.780]   They've had to sell people on their business model, sell all the record labels, put money
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.780]   up front in order to get the agreement signed.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:16.780]   Turntable is cool, but I would be curious about how long it lasts.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:18.780]   Where does turntable get its music from anyway?
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.780]   You upload a song in the local.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.780]   Oh, no, but you can also have songs in the system.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.780]   I think it's from what people about it.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.780]   Is it from user upload, you think?
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.780]   I think so.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:31.780]   The deal, if you haven't used it, is there's five turntables.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:36.780]   The first five people who jump on the turntable get to choose the songs one after the other.
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.780]   There's chat.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:41.780]   Somebody told me that no matter what, it all ends up being a dubstep.
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.780]   I don't know if that's true, but...
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.780]   The thing I like about this is...
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:53.780]   I believe they have an agreement with one publisher to get a small catalog, but they don't have
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:57.780]   any of the label agreements, any of the major publishing agreements.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:01.780]   The legality is very gray, not black.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:05.780]   I think it's all about this meter where you can say this song is lame or awesome.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:06.780]   Lame or awesome.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.780]   Well, that gives DJ's points.
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:09.780]   Right.
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:11.780]   This guy's got a hundred sixty points.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:13.780]   It's actual social music.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:14.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.780]   It's actual social experience for music.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:22.780]   Now, I have to think there's a chance for this to monetize, because look what happens when you hover over the title.
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:30.780]   You can add song to Amazon, iTunes, Blast FM, Spotify or RDO.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:31.780]   So you can...
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.780]   You know, I could buy this song, I presume, if I click that link.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:35.780]   I think that...
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:36.780]   I don't know.
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.780]   Shouldn't the record industry embrace this?
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:41.780]   That's a great way to discover music discoveries.
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:50.780]   If you're using music in the cloud that you uploaded and you want to share it socially,
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:57.780]   I think it might be really interesting to see somebody like Google or even Apple do something like this.
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:58.780]   I mean, you could do this already.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.780]   They've got the music, right?
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:00.780]   They have the music.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.780]   Amazon could do it too.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:11.780]   And they...well, Amazon and Google don't have the licensing agreements as...you know, when they started their locker services,
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.780]   they didn't get those deals nailed down.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:18.780]   But they certainly have a better relationship with the music business.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:21.780]   And Apple has the best relationship with the music business.
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:27.780]   And although they have punted badly with Ping, it'd be interesting to see if...what if they did something like this with Ping,
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.780]   if they turned it into a DJ service?
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:30.780]   Hmm.
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:34.780]   Well, you could only listen to 60 seconds of every song.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:36.780]   You know what?
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.780]   That's all the kids wanted anyway.
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.780]   I watched my son listen to music and he changes it every 10, 30 seconds.
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:43.780]   No attention spans.
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:44.780]   No attention spans.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.780]   No attention span.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.780]   On Pandora, can you share your radio station?
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:50.780]   Yes.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.780]   Yes.
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:53.780]   I think Pandora is kind of wearing it.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:54.780]   It's welcome.
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:55.780]   There's so much repeats on it.
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   And it seems like the playlist wanders.
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:02.780]   I have a Frank Sinatra playlist and all of a sudden I'll be here in, you know, 50 Cent.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.780]   It's like, what happened?
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:07.780]   I actually had an accent streaming account.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.780]   Ex-M's cool?
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.780]   I like the human element and I like the variety station.
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.780]   I was using more...
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:15.780]   But the reason I went back to RDO is because I can do this.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:21.780]   I can press the search on my Android phone, play Bob Dylan Forever Young.
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:26.780]   And then even though it's not on here, it will find it and play it on RDO.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.780]   That is cool.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:29.780]   I mean, that's cool.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:30.780]   Right?
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.780]   Yes.
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:36.340]   The reason that Pandora has reached such a much more massive audience than those services
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:42.780]   and the reason that TurnTable FM is growing at a very high rate.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:46.900]   And the reason I think that Spotify is going to do very well is because they all offer compelling
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.660]   services for free.
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:52.860]   And that's how, you know, people start telling other people about them, the social features,
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:57.860]   you can actually use them because odds are that other people will have access to it.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:00.860]   And, you know, Spotify is going to have a very close relationship with Facebook.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:01.860]   Well, that was...
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:02.860]   That was...
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:03.860]   What we...
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.860]   We'd be part of this awesome announcement is that they do Spotify.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.860]   They didn't.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:11.860]   And then I'm hearing a rumor, maybe encouraged by the RDO people, that it's not Spotify,
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:12.860]   that it's RDO.
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:13.860]   So you know it's Spotify.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:15.860]   They have been working together.
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:16.860]   Not RDO.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.860]   Not somebody else.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:22.860]   I wouldn't be surprised if RDO is part of the music service as well.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:29.860]   I mean, Facebook has, you know, their position is that they want to encourage as many music
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:34.860]   services and if they do it for movies as many different video services as possible.
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:37.860]   They don't want to just learn it out with one from what I hear.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:38.860]   It's the standard Facebook model.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:39.860]   Facebook's a platform.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:42.860]   They don't like to just choose one and make them the one.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:43.860]   Right.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:44.860]   But that's huge.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.860]   I mean, that's another thing that at Facebook already we've been talking about.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.860]   Facebook already we know is sticky.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.860]   People spend hours sitting in Facebook.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:54.860]   This would just be even more hours sitting listening to music in Facebook.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:56.860]   Turn up the Facebook.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:00.860]   Facebook I think has a, that's, forget Spotify RDO.
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.860]   That's who's got the play here is Facebook.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.860]   Oh yeah.
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:04.860]   Right.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:06.860]   So what are they waiting for?
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:07.860]   Why haven't we see?
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.860]   Mark, you have some like you have inside knowledge, Mark.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:14.860]   I don't think Facebook wants to do any of the record label agreements.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:16.860]   I don't think it's sued.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.860]   Well, they don't want to get sued.
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:23.860]   They don't want to spend all the resources and the year talking to the record labels going to New York every week.
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:25.860]   Oh, I'm not saying they should do it themselves.
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:28.860]   I'm just saying why haven't they launched one of these guys?
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:36.860]   Well, I think they'll probably partner up with a number of them and make Facebook the hub for social music.
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:46.860]   And I think Spotify probably has a better chance than RDO or MOG for being the most listened or iTunes for that matter.
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:50.860]   Being the most listened to service on there just because, right.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:52.860]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:54.860]   The one we know it won't be is Apple.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:56.860]   It's going to come in the next few weeks.
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.860]   Facebook calls this, it's launching season.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.860]   So you're going to see the music service come in the next, I think, couple weeks.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:07.860]   And they had references to the music service in the code for the Skype app that you download.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.860]   So it has something called Facebook Vibe.
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:13.860]   So it's a heavily system to download your music into the system.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:18.860]   Somebody's going to, social music is clearly the next thing.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:22.860]   You look at turntable FM and you see how powerful that is.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.860]   I think ARDO does a pretty good job.
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.860]   I follow people and so forth.
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.860]   But Facebook could just clap her this out of the park.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:31.860]   And you're right, they don't have to do any deals at all, Mark.
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:34.860]   They just have to pick a partner or two or three or four.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:41.860]   To a certain extent, they already have the ideal deal maker and Sean Parker who's part of Spotify as well as Warner.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:43.860]   Right?
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:49.860]   So they have an in already for the at least one major music label and a music sharing service.
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:57.860]   Well, you know, the label guys have talked to say one of the reasons that they've waited so long to work with Spotify.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:08.860]   Of many reasons, they've, you know, the labels thought they had audacious terms and they wanted way too much from something that, you know, might hinder the label business model.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:12.860]   But Sean Parker is involved, Napster.
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:19.860]   Daniel Eck, the CEO of Spotify was also the CEO of some like bit torrenting software company.
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:26.860]   So, I mean, these were the guys that were just bringing down the music industry.
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.860]   It's already the music industry now.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.860]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.860]   That's really interesting.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:32.860]   Hulu tops a million users.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:33.860]   That's interesting.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:35.860]   A lot of people using Hulu.
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:39.860]   So at this, Mark Zuckerberg said this is the launching season.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:42.860]   He really did imply that he was going to have a bunch more announcements.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:43.860]   This is just the beginning.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.860]   He also said, I thought this was interesting.
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:51.860]   He had admitted to the fact, yes, we do have 750 million users, which had been speculated by somebody could confirm that.
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:53.860]   But he said it's no longer about users.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.860]   We've reached critical mass.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.860]   Now it's about what do you do with those users?
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:58.860]   What do you invent?
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.860]   How do you innovate around them?
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:07.860]   Well, part of the reason he says that because he knows that the growth is going to have to slow down because there's just not enough people to feel this growth.
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:09.860]   But he does make a very good point.
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:13.860]   He's saying like the next five years, they built this social layer across the world.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:18.860]   And now for the next five years, they're going to put, they're going to make everything else social using the social layer.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:24.860]   So make music social, make video social, make all these different other aspects of social and create
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:28.860]   applications that can harness the network that they built.
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:35.860]   Look at this graph from CNET's Crave blog, actually via this play search.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.860]   The growth of, what do you think that growth is?
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:38.860]   Pretty good, isn't it?
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:41.860]   That is the growth of internet connected television sets.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:49.860]   They're predicting 500 million, half a billion internet connected television sets by 2015.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:51.860]   That's pretty good.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:55.860]   And by the way, you can watch us on your internet connected television set.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.860]   It's good news for me.
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.860]   It's internet connected TV every single year at CES.
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:03.860]   It's like, we can also, can we add into the TV?
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:05.860]   Twenty-five, this year alone.
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:09.860]   Twenty-five percent of all flat panel sets come with some form of internet capability.
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:12.860]   By 2015, it'll be 47%.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:15.860]   Although the interfaces on them are still not very good.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:18.860]   They're clunky and they don't work reliably.
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:23.860]   I've got a relatively new Samsung and it's just, you know, it's kind of frustrating to have
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:25.860]   to go through it even for me.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:26.860]   And I know what I'm doing.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:30.860]   I can't imagine my parents trying to figure that out.
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:33.860]   Are they counting Apple TV sets?
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:34.860]   That's TV sets.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.860]   The actual integrated TV.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:37.860]   Okay.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.860]   Not including Roku, Apple, Google, all the other boxes.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:45.860]   I think it's still my advice to get a box because you better interfaces, right?
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:47.860]   The interface is much better.
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:48.860]   After the fact.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:49.860]   Yeah, right.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.860]   And you can upgrade the box.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:51.860]   It's not in TV.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:55.860]   I think one of the best is Roku.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:57.860]   I love Roku.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.860]   Roku is simple.
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.860]   It's easy to use.
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:01.860]   It is reliable.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:03.860]   It works well.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:06.860]   And it doesn't have its own fee like Apple TV does.
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:11.860]   I mean, at least you need to pay iTunes, you know, fealty for each component.
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:14.860]   But I really like, I really like Roku.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:17.860]   I think it's one of the best values out there.
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:20.860]   What do you use, Mark?
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.860]   I use a future binary.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:23.860]   You watch YouTube.
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:25.860]   It's all on YouTube.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:29.860]   PS3 for Netflix and local videos.
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.860]   It's a good choice.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.860]   Except when it's a take it down the hat.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.860]   Except for that.
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:40.860]   Did you see Will's and Kate play with a touchpad?
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:41.860]   That was cool.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.860]   That was good news for HP.
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:53.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:55.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:59.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:01.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:03.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:09.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:11.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:17.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:19.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:21.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:25.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:27.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:31.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:39.860]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.860]   Speaking of the UK,
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:43.860]   you did a story about this news of the world
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:45.860]   Yes.
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:47.860]   Hacking. Oh my God.
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.860]   You know, I think that was followed.
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.860]   It's been followed so heavily in London
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.860]   and in England and even in Europe.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.860]   But only you're just now kind of paying attention in the US.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.860]   Give us a quick summary of what happened.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:01.860]   Yeah, I mean, it's something that's been going on
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:03.860]   for a very long time for years
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:05.860]   where the news of the world
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.860]   reporters, this, you know,
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:09.860]   giant publication, this tabloid
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:12.860]   that's been going for 130 some odd years.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.860]   And by the way,
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:15.860]   powered Rupert Murdoch's fortune.
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:17.860]   That's right. Yeah.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:21.860]   It's a very powerful publication in Britain.
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:25.860]   Was essentially doing phone hacking
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:27.860]   in order to get a lot of their scoops.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.860]   They would, you know,
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:31.860]   without the physical phone,
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:33.860]   what were they doing?
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:35.860]   They haven't come out and said exactly.
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.860]   What was going on?
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:39.860]   But a lot of people believe a lot of experts say
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.860]   that they were using something called pre texting,
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:45.860]   which is illegal in the US,
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.860]   fairly recently in many countries
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:49.860]   where you call up a phone company
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.860]   and pretend to be the person on the account
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:53.860]   and say like,
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:55.860]   oh, I forgot my voicemail password.
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.860]   Can you help me reset it?
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.860]   And they ask you a few security questions.
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.860]   If it's a celebrity, if it's someone in the royal family,
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:05.860]   or, you know, they were believed to affect
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:07.860]   into all kinds of celebrity.
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:10.860]   So they were basically using social engineering
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:14.860]   to get into people's voicemail.
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:15.860]   Right.
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:16.860]   That's slimy.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:17.860]   That's slimy.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.860]   And, you know, there's now allegations
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:24.860]   that they were breaking into family members of Iraqi soldier,
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:27.860]   or people who were stationed in Iraq in combat
[01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:30.860]   and people who had died in Iraq.
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:35.860]   So, yeah, there's -- it sounds like a lot of slimy business.
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:39.860]   But the story that I did was, you know, jumping off of that,
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:43.860]   like this is a relatively primitive form of phone hacking,
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.860]   but what other kind of hacking is possible
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:50.860]   with, you know, smartphones now that they're growing.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:51.860]   Oh, my God, big.
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:53.860]   I can't believe that we haven't had
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:55.860]   just widespread attacks on smartphones.
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:58.860]   This thing is so valuable, everything's on here.
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:00.860]   Somebody told me, was it Devorak?
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:04.860]   Told me that in New York City, you know, if you're a cabbie
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.860]   and somebody leaves a phone in your cab, you know,
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:08.860]   you can make, like, 100 bucks, you just drive up.
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:10.860]   They know where to go, the corner, and they say,
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:11.860]   "Here's the phone."
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.860]   You make 150 bucks if you pulled the battery.
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.860]   Because that way, all the -- it's not the phone.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:16.860]   It's the data on the phone.
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:18.860]   That way the phone can't be erased ahead of time.
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:20.860]   So, I mean, this, obviously, this is --
[01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:22.860]   we're just -- I'm just waiting for the big attack
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:23.860]   on the smartphones.
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:24.860]   I don't know why we haven't seen them,
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:25.860]   and it can't be that hard.
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:28.860]   I mean, a lot of them have come within the last couple of years
[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.860]   just by standard phishing attacks, you know,
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:35.860]   sending a link through a text message to a page that asks you
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:41.860]   to put in your phone account information or banking information.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.860]   And those have been more lucrative than ones
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:47.860]   that are trying to steal your phone book, for example,
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:50.860]   just because if they get you to call a number
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:53.860]   or send a text to a certain number,
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:56.860]   they can charge it directly to your phone bill
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.860]   and make a killing happen.
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:39:58.860]   Right.
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.860]   That's a money.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:01.860]   A hundred bucks a pop.
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:03.860]   Or more.
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:04.860]   All right.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:05.860]   Let me take a quick break.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:06.860]   We got a great panel here,
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:08.860]   and I just want to thank them for being here, Ben Parr
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:10.860]   and Race Lekinsky,
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:11.860]   visiting us from Canada.
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:12.860]   Pleasure.
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:13.860]   Mark Millian is here.
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:15.860]   You know, you're going to have the King of Canada.
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:16.860]   It's going to --
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:17.860]   Yes.
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:18.860]   Some day soon, it'd be named Will.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:19.860]   Will.
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:20.860]   [ Laughter ]
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:21.860]   Yeah, he.
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:23.860]   Dwight Silverman here.
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:24.860]   Actually, as long as we're talking about Canada,
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:27.860]   we've got a great Canadian product to flog right now.
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:28.860]   You know about French books?
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:29.860]   I do.
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:30.860]   Who doesn't?
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:32.860]   They're a Toronto company.
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:33.860]   They are.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.860]   Do you know them?
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:35.860]   Yes.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:36.860]   I do.
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:37.860]   You use them, Ben?
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:40.860]   I did it when I was a consulting one, go there.
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:42.860]   That's how I found out about them when I was up in Toronto.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:44.860]   Amber MacArthur told me about them.
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:46.860]   I met Mike a few times at a few parties.
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:48.860]   They're really nice guys.
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:50.860]   What a great system.
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:53.860]   You are a freelancer and you have to send out invoices.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.860]   You know what a pain in the butt it is.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:56.860]   I hate it at the end of every month.
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.860]   It's like, I don't want to invoice.
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:00.860]   Your wife does the invoicing, isn't she?
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:01.860]   No.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:02.860]   No, you do it?
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:03.860]   No.
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:04.860]   You're an employee now.
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:05.860]   You don't have to do it anymore.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:06.860]   Yeah, don't have to.
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:07.860]   That's one way to solve it.
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:09.860]   The other way is to go to FreshBooks.com.
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:11.860]   Focus on your work, not your paperwork.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.860]   FreshBooks is so awesome.
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.860]   You upload your logo.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.860]   They create these great-looking professional invoices,
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:18.860]   which you email to your client.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:22.860]   The invoice has a button that says, "Would you like to pay now?"
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:24.860]   via credit card paypalauthorize.net.
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:26.860]   It is, I mean, you get paid faster.
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:28.860]   You're more likely to get paid because of that.
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:31.860]   You can easily create invoices that are automatic.
[01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:32.860]   Payment that's automatic.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:34.860]   Even if your client agrees to that.
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:36.860]   Follow-up is very straightforward.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:40.860]   You could say, every 30, 60, 90 days, maybe make sure if I don't get paid,
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:41.860]   we get a follow-up.
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:44.860]   It just couldn't be slick, or even if you do time and hours.
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:47.860]   They've got this great iPhone app or a web-based app that you can just
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:53.860]   track your hours and then put it right into the invoice.
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.860]   But I just love this system.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:56.860]   It's free for the first three.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.860]   That's the other thing that's great about it.
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:01.860]   If you have three or fewer clients, it won't cost you a penny.
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.860]   Just go to FreshBooks.com.
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:07.860]   Over 2 million people have set and paid invoices via FreshBooks
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:09.860]   since it started in 2004.
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:13.860]   And if you decide, you know, you want to use it and you have more than three clients,
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:15.860]   $20 a month for 25 clients.
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:17.860]   $30 a month for unlimited clients.
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.860]   It's a really great deal.
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.860]   Now, go to FreshBooks.com.
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:23.860]   Sign up for that free account right now.
[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:30.860]   And don't forget to mention you heard it on Twitch because everybody who enters
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:33.860]   this week is going to be in a drawing for a birthday cake.
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:35.860]   It doesn't even have to be your birthday.
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:38.860]   [laughter]
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:39.860]   It's somebody's birthday.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.860]   They're really... it's funny.
[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:43.860]   I don't know who's your friend?
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:44.860]   Mike?
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:45.860]   Yeah, Mike.
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:49.860]   I don't know if it's Mike, but somebody there is really focused on the birthday cake.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:55.860]   It's like, make sure you mention the birthday cake because it's really important.
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:56.860]   It's weird.
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:59.860]   Is it that people want a birthday cake so badly?
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:00.860]   It must be.
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:02.860]   That they will go to FreshBooks.com.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:04.860]   Well, typically you only get one a year.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:05.860]   This is a freebie.
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:06.860]   This is a freebie.
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:08.860]   I'm not guaranteeing the birthday cake.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:10.860]   But you have a pretty good shot at it.
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:11.860]   We've got one here.
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:12.860]   It's great from Caroline's.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:16.860]   FreshBooks.com makes invoicing painless.
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:17.860]   You're going to love it.
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:19.860]   Give it a try today and we thank you for their support.
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:20.860]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:24.860]   It's a company that truly embraced being quirky, which is one of the Zappos models.
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:25.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:26.860]   They're great.
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:28.860]   And they were one of the first Web 2.0 companies really.
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:30.860]   I remember I was showing to me.
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:31.860]   I went, "Ooh, this is great.
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:32.860]   This is beautiful.
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:33.860]   Well done."
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:36.860]   They've gotten big since then.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:38.860]   Let's see.
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.860]   Tech experts exit White House.
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:43.860]   I didn't even know they were there.
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:44.860]   They chased them out.
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:46.860]   Who left the White House?
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:47.860]   Let's see.
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:50.860]   Oh, well, Vivek Kundra.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:52.860]   Was he the CTO CIO?
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:55.860]   Yeah, he was the chief technical officer of the United States.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:57.860]   He took a real job.
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:03.860]   Well, I think they all got frustrated with kind of the glacial pace of government.
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:07.860]   Government just doesn't move fast and these guys are used to, you know,
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:10.860]   just to Silicon Valley paces and they ain't wearing chemmen.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:18.860]   The Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John P. Holdren,
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.860]   Andrew McLaughlin, Chief Technology Officer in Charge of Internet Policy,
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:27.860]   Beth Novec, Deputy Chief Technology Officer for Open Government.
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.860]   But you know, it's also that the campaign is coming.
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:33.860]   I mean, I have to say this happens normally at the beginning of the next campaign season.
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:34.860]   You start with new people.
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:36.860]   You're from Canada, but it's like that.
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:37.860]   You're watching.
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:38.860]   You watch.
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:39.860]   You follow.
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:40.860]   You follow.
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.860]   I actually care more about US politics than I am.
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:43.860]   Sorry to man.
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:44.860]   Is it still Ben Harper?
[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:45.860]   Yeah.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:46.860]   No, not Ben.
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:48.860]   I'm from the same.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:49.860]   Stephen.
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:50.860]   Ben Harper.
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:52.860]   He has a lot of great bands.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:53.860]   He's got a great band.
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:54.860]   He's got a Prime Minister Ben Harper.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:55.860]   That would be awesome.
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:56.860]   Oh, don't for him.
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:57.860]   But yeah.
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:58.860]   Stephen Harper.
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:44:59.860]   Yes.
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:00.860]   See, I follow.
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:02.860]   He also plays music.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:03.860]   He's awesome.
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:04.860]   An avid Beatles fan.
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:06.860]   What do you got to like that?
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:07.860]   Yes.
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.860]   They do that to pretend they're human.
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:10.860]   Sure, Apple.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:11.860]   Politicians do that.
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:12.860]   Oh, yes.
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:13.860]   I play the saxophone.
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:19.860]   I'm a human just like you.
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.860]   What else is here to talk about?
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.860]   South Korea to dump textbooks for tablets.
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:28.860]   They're going to require all elementary textbooks to be available in electronic form by the year
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:29.860]   2014.
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:36.860]   The entire childhood education curriculum will be taught through computers, tablets and other handheld computing devices by 2015.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:37.860]   Wow.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.860]   That'll save a lot of trees.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:40.860]   Wow.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:43.860]   Good news for Samsung, which will probably be the choice of player.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:45.860]   They're a Korean company.
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:47.860]   I don't know how many kids that is, but that's...
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:50.860]   I think it's good news in general, don't you?
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:58.860]   Notre Dame did a University of Notre Dame did a research project in which they had students use iPads instead of textbooks for seven weeks.
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:03.860]   Apparently was quite a success.
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:10.860]   I always worry a little bit with the kids whether an iPad, you know, they're going to end up playing Wii rule instead of reading the books.
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:16.860]   But apparently, University students, anyway, desired the textbooks on digital form.
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:18.860]   You can put the notes in on everything.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:20.860]   You can share the notes with your friends.
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:21.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:24.860]   Actually, they got the iPad at no cost.
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:25.860]   No wonder...
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:30.860]   University students pick iPads over textbooks because they're free.
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:33.860]   Well, that's a flawed study.
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:35.860]   Were the books free or just the iPad?
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:37.860]   No, they get a free iPad.
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:38.860]   Yeah, they get a free iPad.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:39.860]   Oh, God.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:42.860]   You still pay a lot for those books though, even though they're a digital form.
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:43.860]   Well, I know.
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:44.860]   It's insane.
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:47.860]   In the long term, you have one iPad for four years instead of buying like...
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:49.860]   You know where the disadvantage is?
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:50.860]   You can't...
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:54.860]   By the way, this is why I think textbook companies are kind of behind this.
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:57.860]   There's a huge resale market for textbooks.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.860]   You can get most of that money back.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:01.860]   They must cut into their sales terribly.
[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:04.860]   So there's no resale value at all in an electronic textbook.
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:05.860]   Right.
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:09.860]   So I suspect that some of this is greed on the part of textbook manufacturers.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:15.860]   Yeah, I've got a daughter in college and was kind of amazed at the price of online textbooks,
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:17.860]   digital textbooks and how expensive they are.
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:18.860]   They're not even cheaper, are they?
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:20.860]   And then you can't sell them back.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:21.860]   Right.
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:24.860]   I mean, college is a hotbed for piracy.
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:28.860]   So if anyone will figure out how to crack the ebook protection.
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:29.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:30.860]   What?
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:31.860]   No.
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:32.860]   Never.
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:33.860]   What?
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:34.860]   But then you'll get six warnings.
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.860]   Sticks, strikes.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:37.860]   Yeah, you'll get six warnings.
[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:38.860]   Six alerts.
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:39.860]   Don't you?
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:42.860]   It's so funny because college costs so damn much.
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.860]   I don't even know how you even noticed the price of a textbook in the bigger overall bill.
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:46.860]   Oh my God.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:47.860]   You weep at every line.
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.860]   Every freaking line.
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.860]   Every time you pay back that student loan.
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:53.860]   Are you still paying your student loans?
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:55.860]   No, I paid mine off not very long after.
[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.860]   I worked through college.
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:47:58.860]   Good man.
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:00.860]   That's because that's a kid that's got to kill people.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:01.860]   I skipped the step.
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:03.860]   You didn't even go to college.
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:08.860]   I did six months and then I came out to Palo Alto for six, seven months.
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:13.860]   I think if you're going to work in the tech industry, I'm not sure if four-year college is really the right way to go.
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:14.860]   That's Peter Tails.
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:17.860]   Philosophy, I mean he's paying college kids.
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:19.860]   A hundred grand not to go.
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:20.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:23.860]   So next week we're going to go to Comic Con.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:25.860]   Are you fans of the comic?
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.860]   I am.
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:27.860]   Jean-Marie.
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:29.860]   We're going to send Tom Errit and Sarah Lane down there.
[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:30.860]   When is that Friday?
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:31.860]   No Saturday.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:33.860]   Friday and Saturday of next week.
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:35.860]   Make sure you tune in for that coverage.
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:36.860]   That's not next week.
[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:38.860]   That's two weeks from now.
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:39.860]   Two weeks.
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:42.860]   I think the next week is the week.
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:46.860]   Eileen is now explaining to me why next week is two weeks.
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.860]   This week is the sweetest action.
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:53.860]   I've been wearing the end of the week is Sunday.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.860]   It's compression Leo.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:56.860]   It's compression.
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.860]   Did you go there?
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:00.860]   I know that there's quite a bit of piracy in colleges these days.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:01.860]   I've never.
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:02.860]   No.
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:03.860]   Shocking.
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:06.860]   I've learned something today at that and that this week is not next week.
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:09.860]   The next week is not this week.
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:12.860]   Ben Parr, thank you for being here.
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:18.860]   www.benschable.com is the place to read Ben's fantastic writing and good job on asking
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:19.860]   Zuck the question.
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:21.860]   He danced well.
[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:23.860]   Thank you for having me on.
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:29.860]   I've danced with the man who danced with the girl who danced with the Prince of Wales.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:31.860]   Mark Millian, what?
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:33.860]   Good job on popping Zuck the question.
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:34.860]   Yes.
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.860]   All I need is the ring.
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:44.860]   He popped the Zuck question.
[01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:47.860]   Mark Millian, CNN.com.
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:49.860]   Look for him on the website.
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:50.860]   He's @markmillian on the Twitter.
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:52.860]   What are you on the Twitter?
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:54.860]   I like to say the Twitter.
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:58.860]   Every week I get an email from somebody who says it's not the Twitter, it's Twitter.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:01.860]   What is your name on the Twitter, Ben Parr?
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:02.860]   @BenParr.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:03.860]   @BenParr.
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:05.860]   Mark Millian is @Markmillian.
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:06.860]   Ray Slakinski.
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:07.860]   On the Twitter.
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.860]   He's also @slakinski.com.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.860]   Yep.
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:11.860]   You looked at me funny.
[01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:13.860]   No, I had to remember.
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:14.860]   Did I own that one?
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:15.860]   Yes, you own that one.
[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:16.860]   That's an easy one.
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:18.860]   Of course, blogs.
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:19.860]   Here's a URL for you.
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:20.860]   Blog.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.860]   Blog.cron.com/techblog.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.860]   When I'm @DSilverman, I've got a good one too.
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:29.860]   Silverman.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.860]   He does a great show on the Twitter.
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:34.860]   He does a great show on the radio.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.860]   Yeah, technology bites every Wednesday.
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:38.860]   Is that on the FM or the AM?
[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:40.860]   It's on the FM.
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:47.860]   8pm on kpt.org or if you're lucky enough to be in Houston, 90.1 FM.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:49.860]   So you see, it's the internet.
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:50.860]   Why can't it be the Twitter?
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:51.860]   And the radio.
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:52.860]   And the radio?
[01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:54.860]   Why can't it be the Google?
[01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:55.860]   I ask you, my friends.
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:56.860]   I ask you.
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:59.860]   If you have any app purchase to brick, I encourage you to do so.
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:01.860]   We are running out of time to get the bricks.
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:03.860]   I think our first shipment of bricks, they won't be here for a record.
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:04.860]   They won't be here for the 24th.
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:06.860]   I think they come early August.
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:08.860]   So what you do is you go to bricks.twit.tv.
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:12.860]   There are the 8x4 bricks which have 15 characters, two lines each.
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:14.860]   Two lines have 15 characters each.
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:15.860]   So you get your name.
[01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:19.860]   For a slight increase of amount of money.
[01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:21.860]   All of which goes to help us build the studio.
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:23.860]   You can get your logo on there.
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:26.860]   And you can also get a commemorative brick if you decide to.
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:28.860]   You'd like to have a brick of your own in your own home.
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:31.860]   That wall of honor, I can't tell you, it's going to look so cool.
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:32.860]   It's going to look so cool.
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:33.860]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:35.860]   I really appreciate it.
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:39.860]   And we have one more Twit in the old studio.
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.860]   And then we move on the 24th.
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:45.860]   By the way, all the tickets are gone for opening day.
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:50.860]   In fact, I think if we've given out all the seats for the first week, I think we have.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:56.860]   If you would like to come, email my sister, she'll tell you, Eva@Twit.tv.
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:57.860]   Thanks for being here.
[01:51:57.860 --> 01:51:58.860]   We'll see you next time.
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:00.860]   Oh, there's Eileen in the background.
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:01.860]   Another Twit.
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:02.860]   Is in the can.
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:03.860]   He's amazing.
[01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:04.860]   He's amazing.
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:11.860]   I'm excited for the first time.
[01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:14.860]   I'm excited for the first time.
