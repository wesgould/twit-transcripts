[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.120]   We'll be back on January 5th our first episode of the New Year will be all new should be exciting because right after that episode
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.280]   I'll be flying down in Las Vegas for a whole week of CES
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.760]   I haven't gone to CES in years
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.280]   That's that'll be interesting and I hope you'll watch our special CES coverage
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.520]   It'll be aunt and Leo's excellent CES adventure. We're gonna go
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.400]   Booth to booth and talk about talk about a whole bunch of new products. We've got Samable Sam it
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.940]   He's gonna be our car guy. We have Stacy Higginbotham on IOT
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.720]   Dicty Bartolo with a junk in the basement of the sands and Scott Wilkinson on home theater
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.440]   So we've got a lot of material from CES that'll be coming up in about two weeks all week long January 6th
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.640]   through our wrap up on January 10th, but
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.400]   We're still in 2019 and we've got some wild stories from that year including
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.320]   You know this didn't get a lot of attention, but I still think it's pretty important a big win for the public domain
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.880]   So as of a couple of days ago a
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.640]   number of works from not everything from 1923
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.040]   Became public domain. Oh my gosh. They got what what falls inside them. I'm sorry 1922. Yeah
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.600]   Yeah, the great boat willy. Yeah, well Steamboat willies 1924
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.400]   So this is what will be interesting to watch there is no sunny bono anymore to get the copyright extension law
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.920]   That's what happened last time. It will only be one sunny. It's the first time in 21 years
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.440]   Memorial ski run in 21 years the first time that anything's gone into the public domain in two more than two decades
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.040]   That's what the house significant
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.980]   Alex on this because if if you create something fine
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.240]   But give it 25 years and then it goes public domain that some of the arguments they're putting forward for 80 years public domain
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.480]   Oh, not me even maintaining the copyright after the author's dead
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.240]   F Scott Fitzgerald is no longer benefiting from the great. Oh, but his estate is right
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.040]   But it's like the great Gatsby January 2021 two years off
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.080]   Rhapsody in blue next January excellent the sun also rises in 2022
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.000]   But the big one is gonna be January 1st, 2024. That's when not only steamboat willy, but also Superman and Batman
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.760]   Snow white that's gonna lead to an awful of good films
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.760]   Well, this is the interesting thing in the past of course Disney based the their entire
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.040]   Work on other people's work even by the way. I should point out steamboat willy was stolen true
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.520]   But it grooms for a tails public domain
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.280]   They were able to make Cinderella and Snow White, but then they pulled the ladder up behind them made it copyright
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.080]   Exactly and every time this has come up. They've got Congress to extend it the last one was sunny bono's
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.520]   Copyright term extension act in 1999 that added 20 years
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.520]   Keeping everything locked up until January 1st. So it is 1923 works are now
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.040]   Coming into public. I'm probably in the minority decades, but I'd love to see a blockbuster movie
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.800]   Of the great Gatsby starring Superman Batman
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.560]   I did not know where that was going that would be a great opening policy scene
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.200]   Watch this by the way, I have to correct myself. Sunny Bono was already dead when the copyright extension term was passed. Okay
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.160]   He died in 1998. So Congress to honor him. I said an honor to
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:09.520]   It was a different time back in the 20th century. So this is a this is interesting apparently
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:17.560]   You can take some credit for this the internet takes some credit for this the motion picture Association of America the recording industry
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.400]   Association of America the authors guild all of whom have been ones to lobby for the extension in the past
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.640]   gave up
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.520]   It's not something we're pursuing said the RIAA because
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.800]   There's now a well organized grassroots lobby against copyright extension
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.200]   There are large business interests Google now on the anti expansion side also a wide popular movement
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.600]   They can tie it into the internet internet activism. Yep. Yep
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.080]   The net roots net roots. I think that's a good thing. This is my side's like tech dirt
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.960]   They really keep tasks. Thank you my man. Yeah, really appreciate the word super important acts of journalism that do lead to change
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.960]   And how we think about things because the RIAA is not notorious for its cutliness
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.520]   It's a lightness and splitness to give away profits. Yeah, we're gonna get some of our stuff back into our own culture that we made
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.200]   I should be tied to commercial. It was interesting the movie the motion picture house of America
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.760]   We really did it back down on this and they were just like, you know, this is we're not gonna win
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:25.600]   His costing estimate was it's costing them an awful lot in terms of legal fees and false positives when the RIAA did that big anti-piracy
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.640]   You know campaigns started suing people for downloading they lost a ton of money on that the only people that got rich on that were lawyers
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.480]   hood John Quay did in fact
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.920]   China has confirmed use CRISPR to gene edit babies those babies were born and
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.680]   He China says he he forged ethical review papers
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.200]   Recruited eight couples to participate in his experiment resulting in two pregnancies
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.300]   One of the mothers gave birth to twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana. These are the first as far as we know
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:03.080]   Humans born with their genes CRISPR edited he had removed a gene
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.440]   That supposedly would give these children
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.160]   better resistance to HIV
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.140]   And other diseases smallpox, I think
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.200]   But the problem with CRISPR gene editing is the side effects are unknown
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.400]   Yeah, and while people have done this in the lab to rats and other things this is the first time we know of that's you and this
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.080]   Was a big story when we talked about this it was unclear whether it had really happened
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.280]   But now that we know it's really happened. I think this is a watershed moment
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.440]   Yeah, you know, CRISPR is likely to be one of the most
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.200]   The one of the biggest breakthrough technologies of of this century when we get to the end of the century we look back like it
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.080]   It is likely to be, you know, one of the big ones
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:51.240]   Moving too fast in this area is fraught with all kinds of of risks and dangers that
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.800]   It just doesn't feel like we should be, you know moving that quickly, right? There should be a lot more
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.840]   Research there should be a lot more things done in labs before
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.880]   You know, we put this in human beings
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.280]   So that's the scary part and that's why I think the scientific world is really
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.920]   Cringing and has been cringing about this
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:21.000]   Um, and and why they haven't supported obviously the the work of every nation every nation has laws against this
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.640]   I mean, this is everybody agrees. This is not the time to start doing this although
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.120]   Yes, once the genie's out of the bottle
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.800]   Well, don't you think not to be too too cynical about it
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.160]   But uh part of it is like some of the articles that I've read like people are suggesting that you know, this guy
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:43.720]   Kind of did this on his own was gonna promote himself and so not to be overly cynical
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.600]   But like if china was the first to make some sort of crisper breakthrough
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.640]   Um, I feel like that they would have gotten behind it and like look at how chinese technology and medicine is a so i'm
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.520]   I'm wondering if the problem here is that this guy was sort of a lone wolf that um
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.960]   Was uh trying to be a little too promotional because if he if he wasn't and there was real legitimate breakthroughs
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.600]   I don't feel like china would be throwing him under the bus like this. Yeah
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.360]   I'm not sure. You know, he's disappeared from site
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.440]   I think there's two things here that um we aren't considering one is
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.600]   That the current research indicates that the use of the crisper technology is actually incredibly damaging to the genes
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.440]   Themself. So not only are you using crisper to uh target specific genes
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.080]   But what's coming out is the evidence is that crisper is actually damaging entire gene structures
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.480]   Right. So you may actually be causing more genetic defects than you're actually fixing and
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.400]   So this is the reverse side of a of a breakthrough the reality starts to set in that there might be some downsides
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.520]   Um, the children are not being identified by the chinese government
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.240]   But they said the chinese government says we are going to monitor them because there is some concern about their long-term
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.840]   How does it remember when dolly the sheep was the first cloned animal
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.880]   These cloned sheep died very quickly because it turned out not only were they cloning the sheep they were cloning their biological clock
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:09.400]   Yeah, so the senescence was actually going at the same time. Yeah, I think it
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.000]   I think the challenge here with the crisper stuff is they're actually attacking the germline
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.520]   So what that means if those children have genetic defects they'll carry through into the children of those
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:26.360]   Those those babies and so they replicate down through the years and we don't want a situation perhaps
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   where
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.840]   Uncontrolled use of crisper that is actually damaging to the germline then gets fed into the gene pool
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:41.480]   Face recognition under the gun san francisco has now passed a city ordinance banning
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.920]   face recognition tech on tuesday the
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.720]   Board of supervisors passed the stop secret surveillance ordinance
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.680]   Oh, I love living in the bay area
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.840]   Uh, but I actually am thrilled about this because as we know
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.600]   Well, here's here's what uh supervisor erin pescan said the sponsor
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.240]   I want to be clear. This is not an anti technology policy
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.440]   It's an accountability measure to ensure safe and responsible use of surveillance tech
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.480]   and it passed by eight to one
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:22.840]   Uh, and clearly we're starting to see the the the flaws in face recognition
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.400]   And i'll give you a really great example from vice this week
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.080]   So when the police department interviews you
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:38.040]   And says well the guy who did it. What did he look like if you say well kind of look like woody harrelson
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.480]   They'll take a picture of woody harrelson
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.840]   And feed it to the face recognition technology
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:51.240]   law enforcement. This is a great piece in vise is identifying suspects based on all manner of
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:58.600]   Probe photos photos of unknown individuals submitted for search against a police or drivers lice date at base that license database
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.240]   Uh
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.240]   Including celebrities
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.040]   Harrelson's photo in this case returns
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:12.360]   So a guy was caught was caught on camera stealing beer from a cvs in new york city
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.720]   Uh, the surveillance footage was so low quality they didn't get any suspects no hits on the nypd face recognition system
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   So the detective swapped in woody harrelson saying well he looks kind of like woody
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.920]   And yes, they got a lot of hits
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.080]   Including the guy who did it now you tell me
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.600]   If i'm woody harrelson
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.880]   i'm gonna be a little insulted
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.920]   He looks more like kurtl sanders
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.440]   than woody harrelson
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.240]   Looks like a cling on without the forehead appliance. Yeah
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:55.160]   The nypd also fed an image of an unnamed new york nicks player
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.760]   To find a brooklyn man wanted for assault
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.680]   Um
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.600]   I just I think this is not ideal
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.800]   Can we can we say and so I kind of think that maybe san francisco did the right thing?
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.120]   What do you think?
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:20.680]   And also I think it's creepy. I'm ready to invest in fake noses and sunglasses
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.440]   So our uh, I mentioned this before our our founding engineer
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.920]   Colleen who now works for facebook right she went to the dark side
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.200]   Had a plan to build an led collar
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:41.240]   Uh within for red leds that were so bright they would blind cameras. So you just look like a glowing ball on camera
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.720]   See if see if karston can look this up real quick, but there's a shirt that had a t-shirt that that's being sold
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.520]   Oh, yeah, that that'll trick. Yeah, you yeah, you may be talked about it. Uh, no, no, but I remember reading it
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.240]   Yeah, so it's got some sort of a graphic on it that will fool the
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.200]   The the cameras to be like well, this is not a person
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.880]   Yeah, forget about that. This is not going to solve the facial recognition thing
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.360]   But yeah, there's a shirt out there to if we're in a crowd in a protest in theory
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.720]   It's the hyperface anti paparazzi collection
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.280]   Actually, that's different. This is glowing. Yeah, because that's for the that's only if it flashes
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.600]   Yeah
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.560]   And then it it's reflective so it reflects back
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.400]   Sounds like a brilliant idea. That's a great idea. This is hyperface
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:32.440]   Uh, which apparently if you wear this and on a t-shirt this this this image
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.760]   the uh
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.640]   You don't have to wear it on your face you wear it on a t-shirt and the cameras go
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.280]   But on the other hand, this is being designed by an artist. So I'm nervous about the whole thing
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:50.200]   Yeah, and how many software updates until the cameras just get smart enough to get around that. I mean, yeah, it's immediately
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.920]   been borked
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.240]   Still, I like the idea. The other problem is if you're a person of color if you're african-american
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   There's a much higher incidence of false positives mostly because it's stuff strained on white folk
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.480]   So right that's not that's not a good thing
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.240]   And also if correct me if i'm wrong, but all this law said was that the city
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.040]   Cannot use this technology. There's no this doesn't say that any
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:22.040]   Grocery store or or private home or whatever cannot use this technology
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:28.600]   Yeah, I don't think they can even stop you right? I mean, I guess they could it's not like well in theory you could say
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:34.120]   Something stops at the borders of our municipality. But that's hard to do. Yeah, no the ordinance
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.720]   Says that city departments have to seek specific approval before acquiring any new surveillance equipment
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.320]   And private companies are not affected although
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:52.520]   If you wanted to sell tech to the city government of this kind you would be but but not if you're a cvs store that wants to have it in there
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.840]   Actually, you know, there's some very beneficial uses of face recognition
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.720]   uh, who was the artist
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.160]   Who had a problem with stalkers and she used face recognition to
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.480]   Who was it?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   No, Richard, huh?
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.840]   It was tay-tay tay-tay tayla swift. That's right
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:18.600]   And so they used face recognition at the concert entrances to look for bad guys
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.680]   We know other stadium have used it to ban people who are known
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:29.000]   Disruptors or problems on the other hand if you get a false positive and you can't go to the tay-tay show that sucks
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.840]   The classic positive use of it is that they always trot out is if you've lost the kid in disney world there you go right? Yeah
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:43.000]   Yeah, I saw demo at qualcom's ai day a few weeks back where they were you know showing you
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.680]   An interpreted form of what the ai sees when the camera looks at you and say a retail storefront situation
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.680]   And i've you know, it's meant to do the catch shop lifters thing
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.560]   But in the demo was calibrated to detect whether you know to try and guess your
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   apparent gender
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.280]   Uh, you know and also your age
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:09.960]   So I spent I wasted probably 35 minutes trying to trying various pouts and smiles to get it to go from adult person to young person
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.840]   And do it and I was able to fool yeah, I've fooled about three or four times. I'm trying to get it. I'm trying to get old you are
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.280]   I can't figure it out. Yeah, it's too fuzzy. I got to vastly on the lens
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   Uh, yeah, I mean these we've seen so many examples of these things making horrible mistakes somebody the charam saying if it wasn't so long ago a google ai
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   Thought a turtle was a gun
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:36.120]   Right now so and honestly let's think about this use case in disneyland
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.200]   So what is it doing looking at everybody Disneyland to see if they're the lost kid
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.040]   Yeah, I mean again, they would find the person that took the child, but your child's still gone
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:53.240]   This is better for finding someone that no, no, it's not a stranger danger of duxions. Just the kid got lost
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.560]   It could be either or though. Oh
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.640]   Yeah, what what i'm saying is is like again, I don't know. I'm that's just the thing that they trot out all the time like I feel like
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:08.120]   Any human could walk into a crowd and see a kid wandering going where's my mommy? I mean that how hard is that?
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.920]   Yeah, and you do a better job probably
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.080]   Exactly happened faster than it would to get the cameras and then you know
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.720]   Deal with all the data and then find them that way
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.920]   I uh, I'm ashamed to admit i'm a terrible parent. I lost my daughter at lego land
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   Uh, but I got somebody who's better and she graduated from college. So I feel like
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:34.440]   It was truly terrifying was there with my son and daughter. Thank god. My wife wasn't there at the time
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.680]   She would she would have killed me. She never she's hearing about it for the first time now
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.880]   And uh, i'm with henry and where's abby?
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:49.480]   Where's abby and we you know, I went immediately like to the entrance to block whoever stole her from getting out
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.920]   Which is stupid, but she found us and she was not happy. She said I was shopping
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.080]   She was like eight. I was in the store looking at lego
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.320]   Ever since san francisco ban face recognition more and more cities are doing it
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.960]   Uh, I think even states are thinking about it
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:14.760]   This test definitely is a trend and we'll keep watching that in 2020 our best up show brought to you today by health iq

[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.880]   The problem is that
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.200]   For most life insurance companies, you're just a number and they don't take into account
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:54.040]   Your healthier lifestyle. That's why you need health iq they use science and data to get lower life insurance rates for people like you health conscious people

[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.080]   It's not a conspiracy. That's just how statistics work how life insurance works
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:22.200]   You might be healthy, but they your your health insurance company doesn't really know that you're just a number to them and her health iq
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.520]   basically your life insurance

[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.200]   Now his body mass index is very high because it's all muscle
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:52.760]   But BMI doesn't take that new account. So that number to a life insurance company. It looks bad
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.280]   They might say oh you're overweight ant we can't give you good insurance
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.760]   That's why ant goes to health iq

[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.040]   There's nothing funny about this story
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.280]   Uh

[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.520]   Apparently, why was she so grumpy?
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:52.680]   Was there something wrong with grumpy cat? Yeah, she has she has an underbite and she has feline dwarfism
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.800]   That's what it was. Yeah, she's teensy weeny

[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.240]   Uh
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:12.200]   She quickly became a meme the most famous a picture of grumpy cat with the words. I had fun once it was awful

[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.080]   I've heard once I did it. Yeah
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:17.400]   Uh, they uh there were grumpy cat movies on lifetime. Of course there were
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.520]   She was the official spokescat of friskies
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:26.200]   Grumpy cat's worst christmas ever that was the lifetime movie. She was in the cover of new york magazine
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.680]   Number seven on the new york times advice how to and miscellaneous bestseller list
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:36.520]   Grumpy cat you want to can get well, it's too late. You already can see it on the screen
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:43.240]   Make a guess those of you at home listening how much grumpy cat made her owners in six years
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.440]   estimated 100 million dollars
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.600]   Wow
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.600]   I don't believe that
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.280]   I really I really don't grumpy podcaster
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.680]   I really don't
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.560]   Well, they would not want to believe that or are you just jealous?
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.640]   They disputed it. They said no, that's not true, but they never provided an alternative number
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.240]   Uh president the president has signed an executive order declaring
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.360]   A national emergency. He likes to do that
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:20.040]   Uh and pro hit I don't know why it's a national emergency, but suddenly it is prohibiting us companies from using telecom services
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.680]   That are solely owned controlled directed by a foreign adversary
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.640]   Which includes wah way
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:37.800]   Huawei's been in the spotlight since 2012 I think when the department of commerce said be careful with walway zte and show me
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.720]   They're all chinese companies people have pointed to the ownership of walway. It seems
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   No one can really be sure who owns it walway says we're owned by our employees
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:52.600]   But without without much proof and certainly also in walway's case the founder
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.000]   was
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.320]   in the people's liberation army so the
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.280]   The the implication is that he still has ties to the pla
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.520]   And I think also that's that's part of the story too. So okay
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.080]   I go ahead and finish the intro and then i'll jump in
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.760]   No, no, no, I mean think that's enough. I think people we've been talking about this for a while
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.320]   uh my position on this is
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.600]   I'm a little on the fence because it does seem like it's part of a political
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.920]   uh, you know as part of the uh chinese tariffs the kind of the political
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:31.080]   Tener so and we've never seen evidence that walway is doing anything walway says we've never done anything show us
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.680]   That's exactly what I was going to say
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   So, you know, I mentioned the or you mentioned that we're doing the the weekend episodes now
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.160]   And so last weekend I had dextertilion on who's a telecoms analyst
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.520]   I think in london because i've been reading these headlines
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.360]   I'm like so what is this walway? I'd never heard of them and now all of a sudden, you know
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.720]   There's that huge tray war that they're at the center of and the three things that I learned were a
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.040]   like you just said
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.360]   one of the reasons that other countries are not
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.720]   uh
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.080]   willing to ban
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:07.480]   walway is because and even the british and the german's have said this apparently straight up like if there is
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   intelligence
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:15.800]   That walway is spying and is too close to the chinese government the united states government has not shown us that
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.280]   Like maybe we'd be willing to
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.640]   Get on board with this banning, but we haven't seen the proof
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:28.760]   Um and again, I i'm not an expert in this and dextert is more than i am and he said yes as far as I know
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.560]   There is no there is no smoking gun now that doesn't mean
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.760]   If there was some sort of a conflict or a war
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.360]   Maybe china wouldn't lean on walway and be like, you know
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.600]   Maybe shut this or that down, but then the us has been able to do that for years
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.080]   So is part of this just somebody else can do uh the thing that we
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:53.480]   It was implicit that we could always do but the two things aside from that that there's there's no
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.840]   Actual proof that anyone seems to know of that there are these close connections
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.440]   I the second thing was is how come they
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.400]   How come they're the only ones basically that can do 5g and they're not there's also
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   Eric's does it no kid does it?
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.880]   Does it but but the problem is number one is is walway by far
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:20.840]   They're number one. They have the most 5g patents and then what happened is over the last 10 years or so
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.760]   They like they've it's classic they they come in and they do it cheaper and better
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:33.480]   So if you're vietnam if you're india if you're argentina and you got to dial up a national 5g network
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.240]   Not only is the company that will do it for you the best
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:43.080]   Huawei it's also the cheapest so if the us leans on all these other countries like they're trying to do to say no
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.360]   No, no, don't use them. Um, it doesn't make economic sense
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.080]   And then the third thing was that
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:56.280]   You know, I said well how come how come they're the only ones left standing like and and dexter said well
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:03.640]   It's like whatever became of Motorola what are became of lucent alcatel. He's like yeah, it's just over the last 20 years
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.280]   It's everything has has shifted to where while no one was paying attention
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.920]   Um, this chinese company
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:19.320]   Uh came came up from below and and can now do is the best at doing the technology that is as everyone tells us the key
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   to the next generation of tech
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.280]   I should also point out
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.520]   This is going to be a big on the other hand
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.240]   segment that
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.960]   much of walway's 5g switching gear is software bound and so
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.600]   Why didn't it was just hardware you could look at it and say well, this is okay. It's not phoning home
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.080]   But once it's software there's and it's getting regular updates
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.920]   Anything could happen and if you're a chinese company
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.880]   I wonder how much freedom even if you're not owned by the chinese government
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.840]   I wonder how much freedom you have if the chinese government came to walway and said okay
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.200]   We'd like you to put this in your firmware
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.080]   Could they say no?
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.480]   But I noticed we don't say it's just walway. We don't say zte we don't say
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:10.200]   uh, shall me we don't I mean in one plus one plus
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.280]   And most of our gear is made in china. So
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.200]   I'm sure foxcom would have the same problem if the chinese government said hey according according to dextor
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.760]   It is the so the the way that walway
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.480]   Uh in the late 80s early 90s. I think that's the timeline
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.160]   Um became got off the ground is their first
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:36.600]   Contract was with the pla so in the late 80s early migration army. Yes
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:43.720]   Uh, so when the the chinese army says we need our own national network telecoms network for security purposes
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:51.880]   Um, it's walway that gets that contract and delivers and then there have been these whispers behind the scenes that why does walway have
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:57.720]   Apparently this access to unlimited capital in certain instances to win certain contracts
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   And so people are assuming that then sure that's because why do you think it's so cheap?
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.520]   Right, right, right
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.720]   Uh
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   Well, the other shoe
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:13.640]   Dropped today because google according to roighters. This is not yet confirmed at least not as of press time
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.600]   As if we had presses as of press time
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.760]   But apparently roger says google has suspended business with walway
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.000]   Will no longer
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.880]   Update android phones made by walway. That's not a concern inside china because of course google doesn't do business in chinese
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:36.520]   So those phones are not you know, they're open source android, but they're not using google apps and furthermore walway phones will lose
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:42.040]   Google apps google services including the play store and youtube apps
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.840]   That is a big penalty and by the way the walway phones
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:52.120]   Are beloved in the united states you can't buy them, you know from a phone company
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:59.560]   But but people like paul thurout of windows weekly. He loves his walway. I was just gonna make that point. I mean that when when
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.520]   About a year and a half ago when uh walway took the stage at ces
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:09.240]   And was remember that i have this great atnt deal to announce they didn't and then uh,
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:15.000]   Richard you their consumer business group executive sort of went off script and said we think this is really bad because us consumers
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.080]   Don't have access to the best choice which at the time was their mate 10 pro they were announcing
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   They were pissed because basically it was the united states government that went to atnt and said it would be foolish if you who to sell this phone
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   And so they pulled out atnt exhibiting its its usual. I forgot what the nsa memo said
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.680]   It's uh unusual cooperativeness or something
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.360]   Was like oh, yeah, okay fine. Um, but my thing is
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.240]   It's telling them to be cooperative usually. Yeah
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.520]   Well at the time I was like well the mate 10 pro is is is fine
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:52.360]   But I don't think it's the big loss to us consumers that walway said it was and then what they did over the next year was build
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   two of the most
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:59.880]   Impressive and innovative from a hardware standpoint smartphones I had ever used and now you know
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:06.840]   I mean it's a cameras from the cameras to the reverse wireless charging that was so samsung due to the weird material finishes their wonderful phones
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:13.800]   And now to see to see this develop is really a shame because if it goes through yeah, you won't even they won't even work if you import them
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:20.920]   Or they won't work. Well you won't want a an android phone that has no google services on exactly. That's a non-starter
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:26.760]   Um, yeah, these are these phones have like a cameras in them. They have 4,000 milliamp hour batteries
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:33.400]   I have a p20 which I guess I won't use anymore even more to the point. No more security updates. It means you're really
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.080]   You know, this is not a phone to buy. We can't recommend this phone
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:43.800]   But that's the other point the this this uh, they actually haven't as far as I can tell brought the full hammer down yet where
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.960]   A us company cannot do business remember they they did that was zt for a while
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:53.160]   And then dialed it back was it's it's anyway. Yeah, but forget about the software
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.000]   Leo like
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.480]   Like they won't be able to manufacture their phones and and there's articles that have come out about you know
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:05.160]   Huawei's been been stockpiling components and stuff like that. But if they can't do business with us
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.560]   component
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:14.200]   Providers like they can't manufacture a modern smartphone. It's almost it's almost the reverse of what we're saying like you can't do a
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.200]   5g network without Huawei
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   Um, Huawei says in anticipation of this they've been stockpiling american parts
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.560]   But uh
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.560]   Others are unconvinced
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.880]   the head of walleye's high silicon chip division friday
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:38.680]   Shug shrugged off concerns about disruptions to supply saying in his long grip preparing for this kind of extreme scenario
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:44.600]   They will aim to be technologically self-reliant going on going forward industry experts
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.800]   Uh say that's they're going to be a stretch. It's hard to
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.400]   Isn't that funny you if you ask somebody
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.720]   What do you think the key components for the walleye phone are you would where do they come from you wouldn't say us?
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.280]   But that's what's different about the world today
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.160]   It isn't just a chinese phone
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.080]   Nothing your car is not just a
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:14.520]   German car or or a japanese car. It's a global economy
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:22.280]   A company you haven't heard of in a while a company that made its kind of famous debut at south by some years ago four square
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.400]   10 years ago actually it's exactly 10. Yeah. Yeah
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.520]   It took the took Austin by storm
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:33.880]   It's uh taking Austin by something a little less than a storm this time with a new app called hyper trending
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:38.840]   But you got an interview with Dennis krowley and saw something that i found bone chilling
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.880]   But we'll let you talk about all of that so yeah, it's uh
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:47.560]   I also hadn't thought about four square maybe in a decade since it was four squares hay day, but
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.560]   Yeah, you could be forgiven for wondering whether four square even still existed
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.360]   um, but the four square of today is this
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.400]   location data giant rivalling the powers of
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.960]   Facebook and google almost
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:07.720]   Um, like you may not even think that you're a four square user if you've never used the app but chances are that you are
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:14.920]   Uh four squares technology powers the geo filters in snapchat tags we chose twitter. It's an acua, thre uber
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.960]   apple news airbnb we chat most sam sung phones the photo
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:26.680]   Their photo app on sam sang swum and essentially yeah swarm all four squares native apps
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:32.680]   And uh, I mean as four squares website says if it tells you where it's probably built on four square
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.560]   And all that amounts to that four square has the capability to
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:43.640]   track most people with smartphones track their locations in real time and
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:49.720]   hyper trending which is um a feature for four squares apps that they rolled out at south by south west
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.200]   It shows this
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:38:01.960]   live map of austin that update that shows basically the locations of all the phones all the people with smartphones in austin in real time
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.920]   Albeit, it's a aggregated and anonymized a bit
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:11.880]   So you just see like a big circle if there's a bunch of people at one coffee shop versus a small circle if there's only two or three
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.000]   Um, but it's a real trot a real time
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.040]   Tracking the service that speaks to the amount of data that four squares collected
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.200]   Um, and when I went to go meet with Crowley on thursday
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.160]   We're going to be talking about hyper trending, but he ended up showing me this
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:34.840]   internal game kind of app that four square had uh been developing just among its co-workers and
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.160]   it essentially is kind of like candy land but an app and the
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:45.800]   Except for the cards that you draw, you know in candy land you get cards in order like move along little row the rainbow row
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:54.520]   Except for the cards in this app are based on real people's location data and where they are really going
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.680]   So he had pulled up his phone when we were meeting and uh, it was like, okay
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.120]   Well, the the candy land that he had was based on new york city
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.320]   And so he's like, okay, well, I need to move to the men hat and bar square next so if I go look at whoever
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   Is in like proximity to my phone based on who has for who four square has data on?
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.480]   I can see that there's one person who spends a lot of time at midtown bars
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:22.520]   So I'm going to add him to my team and next time he this person in the real world goes to a midtown bar
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.160]   And four square tracks him all moving forward in the game
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.080]   Which is just insane that this company has that sort of technology
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.520]   I kind of blame myself because when four square launched 10 years ago
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.520]   I jumped on it. I thought this is fun
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:40.200]   And I would fight to be mayor of twit with my wife or mayor of our local coffee shop
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.840]   And then they pivoted to swarm which was basically the same thing four square became an app
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.760]   It would tell you about places, but swarm was where you checked in and I used that for a while
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:54.280]   I think lisa still does I think she's in a battle with one of our engineers to be mayor of the twit studios
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:00.360]   But I stopped because I thought that's you know, you've got to be mayor. It was kind of silly
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.680]   But I thought well, I've stopped so they don't know where I am anymore
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.880]   I guess I was wrong this
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.000]   You mentioned that kraale wasn't sure if it was cool or creepy
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.720]   Dennis it's creepy
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:20.440]   It's creepy. I'll read from your article downstairs in the cafeteria. There are 40 people kraale says he's looking at a
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.800]   Coffee company real cafe on the first floor of the building they're in
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.480]   40 people
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.840]   These are people that are actually there. We don't put their names. We just put their unique advertising id
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:36.120]   We turn that into a fake name and a fake avatar, but it is their unique advertising id
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:42.680]   So basically the same and also you can definitely de-anonymize that if you see, okay, there's one person that only goes to
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:50.360]   These like four areas. This is my bar putty. I keep seeing him here. It must be 439 472 133419
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.200]   And then and then yeah, but well
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.400]   I have one question then you can ask yours patrick
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:03.000]   Are there this isn't from four square this information where this is like i'm using a samfasang phone
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.240]   Is it sending location information to four square?
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:13.160]   So this I believe in samfasang it is four square powers the geotagging features like whenever you take a photo
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.360]   There um how it'll like show you like a little
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.960]   It's going to but is it also coming out or is that yeah? Yeah, so it's a two way
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:27.640]   Do that yeah every time your phone takes a photo and tries to geotag it like sends out
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:34.200]   Signals like he uses bluetooth wifi gps couple different things and then runs that by four squares like a
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.680]   Whole list of locations and then four squares like oh he's at twit studios
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.280]   But he'll but four square also gets the data that you're at twit studios, you know
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.120]   That's the part that's weird and this is we're gonna have a sign up for this
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.720]   Yeah, and remember verizon got in a little bit of heat because they were sending
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.720]   Unique IDs from their verizon phones. They even got fined for that
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:59.640]   Remember how much trouble uber got in because they had a god mode that did the same thing but only with uber
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:06.520]   This is 10 times worse and uber by the way is one of the apps that sends information back to four square apple maps
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.560]   Oh the big privacy focused apple sends it back air b and b we chat
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:17.960]   basically any app or thing that uh uses location services that isn't connected directly to
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.720]   Facebook or google is probably powered by four square because they
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.880]   have the most advanced I guess location uh
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.080]   Technology when it comes to pin pointing where you are
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:36.760]   But that's the the the back end of location services for four square who just happens to be
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:45.800]   Very popular and so has location data on a lot of people in the same way that facebook or google for example has a lot of data
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:52.600]   On a lot of people the thing that they're showing now the hyper local app or mode or whatever they want to call it
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.400]   is uh completely
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.520]   Anonymized right if we want to believe them
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.520]   Um, this is just an application of all the application data
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.880]   They already have and that many other people also have this is real time data
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.680]   Patrick not coming from the four square swarm app. This is coming from all those other apps
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:17.000]   I understand so it's the location services. Yeah that are used by many
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.920]   By the way googles apps and devices and they do the same thing right because they get that info
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.320]   On the same way is basically. Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:31.800]   I think that is I think the difference is that most people probably don't realize that when you're using uber or uh,
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.720]   I don't know trip advisor or something or you having
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   Accu whether whether alerts turned on the back of your phone that you're one consenting to give your data to these apps
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.680]   But also consenting for it to be used in the future to create some hyper trending app
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:52.440]   Or the thing that I find the most worrying is that when um, I was speaking to Crowley who's saying that hyper trending
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.520]   It's going to turn off after south by south west
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:01.080]   But the reason why they're demoing it there is for developers to be like, oh, we could use it in this way or build this app off of it
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:06.920]   Um going forward and so it this same information that you didn't really consent to be used in this way
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.640]   Even though I suppose you technically did could be used for any number of other apps
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.320]   I think the right the concern is the metric finish then they're not then. Yeah, go ahead very quickly
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:25.560]   Uh, I I can't believe I'm going to defend this but just to to explain exactly what he's trying to do with this long post
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:30.040]   Uh, he's saying we can basically build a
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:37.800]   Catalog of the popular places in this city at south by south west and we're doing it now
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.080]   Showing it we think it's cool or creepy
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:46.760]   acknowledges the creepy factor and we're turning it off because we think there is something interesting here
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:51.880]   And we want people to start thinking about these things and to kind of, you know
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:45:00.280]   Think about the uses and the guidelines and all of this so the announcement here is the use of location data that
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:06.520]   Sure, we might have not realized that they had so much of it, but we know google has a lot of it
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:13.080]   We know facebook has a lot of it. It's not that different the big new thing here is I guess two things first four square
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:17.880]   Also has a lot of location data like the others and they built this
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:23.800]   Application with that hyper trending mode, which again
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:31.240]   Is is anonymized and only shows the popular places in the the city
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:38.360]   So it's a way to see which locations and stores and and restaurants are popular in a way that you couldn't be for
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.920]   So I don't know that there's something
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:47.480]   I don't want to say new, but I don't know that it's that different from what facebook or google can already do
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   I'm not sure why it's that
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.240]   Creepy if I want to play a little bit of devil's advocate
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.520]   Well, here's here's the the case on the other side first of all
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.880]   I think that they should release that game to the public because I think that'd be a great
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.560]   Consciousness raising exercise for people to see that this is real people
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.680]   This is what they know and because right now people just don't get it
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.720]   The other point that I think is the bigger point is that the phone in your pocket
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:18.120]   We're out. We all have a phone on us right now all of us everyone in this building and everyone in the world and
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   Google is tracking everywhere you go facebook is tracking everywhere you go the carrier is tracking and selling that information everywhere you go
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.960]   Many of your apps on your phone are doing it most of them
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:35.000]   Sending it to four square how secure is that communications medium?
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.560]   The point is that it's not just somebody is tracking
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:43.720]   Lots of people are tracking you and we have no access or knowledge about how secure it is how hackable it is
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:48.280]   Whether the chinese government is tracking is is tapping into this information
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.400]   Whether it's being sold whether it's not being sold
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:58.040]   What I do know is that it's all for the purpose of commerce and advertising and the the advertising still sucks
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:03.320]   It's not i'll give you accurate. Yeah in terms of yeah, nobody's getting a benefit from it
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.320]   Just what you're saying so it would be okay if somebody were making money on this or they were
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.600]   Showing me products. I wanted to buy that would be great. Yeah, if I were getting some better because that's the common defense is like
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:19.640]   Oh, then you're able to have ads that people actually want to see which I don't think anybody is thinking wow my ads are great now
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.640]   I'm so happy that I'm seeing so many relevant ads
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.000]   Google could do this if they for instance if niantic turned on
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.960]   In pokemon go or ingress turned on a map
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:35.240]   That showed you all the other players and where they are in the city and it would be such an eye opener
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:40.360]   I think these companies know very very well and maybe dens does maybe that's his reason for doing this
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.120]   That there would be a hue and cry right now nobody
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.960]   But the geeks at south by and the few people listen to show know about it
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.200]   But and read your wired piece, but that's not the mass of general population
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.760]   I think if the general population I think of Elizabeth Warren saw this as she'd flip her lid
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:02.200]   Probably give you a nightmare scenario Patrick that will that so
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:08.840]   It's anonymized right it's just an id it's not so i'm a i'm a
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.880]   Russian spy and I want to keep track of an nsa agent
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   Uh, I just hang out
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:21.800]   Until in a bar until that agent that I want to keep track of because I have his picture shows up
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:27.240]   And then I can start tracking his hyper trending presence on four square
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.320]   Maybe it's not public. Maybe I have to buy the service
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.920]   And I can pretty quickly triangulate. Oh, that's him once i've got his id
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:39.800]   I no longer have to surveil the guy. I know where he is at every moment of every day. Exactly
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.600]   I know whose girlfriend is I know when he's at the office
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   I mean hyper trending isn't that specific thing?
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.880]   It is it is hyper republic it is because all you have to do as you pointed out
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:54.040]   You can de-anonymize it by figuring out who's that guy that's going to all these bars
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:59.960]   You can do it at scale with a something that was individual where you had an individual like the um
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.280]   The game that Dennis showed me the monopoly game. Okay. Yes, you're right
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:11.560]   Yeah, this is more of like a hyper trending right hyper trending shows you essentially
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.040]   a list of
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:20.360]   Stores or restaurants places of business and tells you how many people are there so it's a lot specific moment
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.520]   So it's a lie it's not in Dennis who says yeah, I know this is controversial
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.240]   That's why we're showing everybody that's a lie because if they show them lot the lollipop game
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.960]   And what they really know
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.120]   People would freak the hell out
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:39.640]   Just like the uh gut mode for from uber exactly data didn't disappear
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.160]   It's just that that interface was hopefully
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.240]   uh
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:50.440]   Made forbidden and no one has access to it except a few very authorized people
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.120]   But the fact that hyper trending exists or not
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.000]   Uh, doesn't change the fact that all of them, you know
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.640]   Location data exists and and as an anonymous as you claim to make it can be de-anonymize
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.320]   I do have to point out that both apple and google claim they use
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.800]   technique to
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.720]   Deeply anonymize it which is not to take the full trip but a segment of the trip
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.120]   So they don't have a starting point and an ending point
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:21.720]   Um, they they make some I think better efforts and there are claims that you can
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.080]   Supposedly mathematically prove that this stuff is anonymous
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:31.000]   Uh, it doesn't look like four squares making any attempts to do that at all every company trust themselves and
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.680]   They're their message to the public is hey trust us. We're google apples four square, etc
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.800]   We're at and t where this company where that company trust us
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.200]   We will keep your data secure. We will won't be hacked. We won't share it
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.840]   We won't de-anonymize it. We none of that stuff is going to happen. Of course all those things happen all the time
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:54.440]   And it's just uh, it's something that everybody needs to be much more aware of and I think that
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.720]   You know, we need help from all quarters. We need phones that are that that can that can
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.400]   Uh, turn off location by default
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.280]   Quickly more conveniently more transparently and a whole bunch of other things
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.720]   Uh, because right now it's just it's getting to the point and and again
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:17.400]   I'm not kind of amazed at this conversation because this is almost exactly the conversation. We're gonna have about facebook
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:23.480]   Yeah, there are many many points and and and we're gonna we're gonna do it's actually a good table setter for the facebook
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.280]   Exactly a conversation paris when you interview denis
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:32.760]   What was the sense you got from him? Was he proud of this? Did he understand?
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:37.480]   How upset people would be if they knew that he had this lollipop game
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:43.480]   He was speaking about it like it was the most normal thing in the world and I think at one point later in our conversation
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:50.360]   I was like this is honestly very surprising to me. Um, because one I mean, I'm a tech reporter. I follow these spaces pretty
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   Thoroughly and regularly and it doesn't it didn't seem obvious to me or my editor even when we had walked when we were talking about this
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:03.940]   conversation to begin with that this sort of granular level of data was something that four square had and was playing with
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:12.340]   On a regular basis and they think he replied something the effect of oh, yeah, this happens to us all the time. We don't realize
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.580]   how
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:19.140]   I guess not callous or how blaze we are towards things that
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:24.580]   Anybody outside of our company would be like, oh my god. Wow, you have this sort of information
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:30.500]   I think he said that he often whenever he has conversations with his mom or sister or family members
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.940]   And mentioned some of the things that they do he gets
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:40.900]   Shocked back and stepped back into reality. This is why these people should not be allowed to decide
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.940]   What what this stuff because they're completely
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:48.340]   Uber didn't realize how horrific god mode was
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:53.700]   I mean, they're so callous about this that they should not be allowed to make decisions
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:53:00.180]   Four Square even has a it's like a tech ethicist panel like they have a group of
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:07.380]   Fingers in the space so they've hired anytime somebody says oh, this might be a controversial subject. They work for four
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.220]   panel. Yeah, but I mean
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:14.900]   But to what Mike was saying, how do we address this you were saying we we need
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:22.820]   An easy way to manage location services on the iPhone at least i'm guessing it's the same case on android phones
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:28.500]   It's very easy to go in and disable location services as a whole or per application
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:34.180]   Um, but the minute you open your map it starts sending data back to four square the minute you open this
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:38.660]   Nope, not if you disable it for this application because it doesn't know where you are
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:44.660]   Exactly. So that's the point. So people should stop using weather apps map apps
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.660]   Uh, I mean so many apps know your location stop using Yelp
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:55.140]   Uh, even if you only send location when the app is running, which is probably the right default setting for all of these
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:54:00.100]   Uh, you're sending out enough information that could be I think the real issue here is
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:08.660]   There are so many signals that somebody with the desire to combine signals is going to get a very complete map
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.980]   So really the only way is just to not carry a smartphone
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:16.500]   But our people willing to do that
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:23.540]   I think that the idea of consent like consent in these cases is an illusion when
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:27.220]   It's just a binary choice when it comes to our sort of privacy settings
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:33.620]   Whether it's if it's you get this feature or you get access to facebook and the things that you need to be a person in the world
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.020]   unfortunately nowadays or
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:42.100]   You don't if you want to not send all of your information out and even in the cases of okay
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:47.060]   Let's say you turn off location services for one thing and you only use it for one second to order your uber
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:51.140]   You're still sending out just more when do we think of location services?
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:56.660]   Maybe we think of you're sending out one signal, but no your phone is sending out here are the 10
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:01.380]   Bluetooth signals. I'm picking up next to me here are all the Wi-Fi networks that I can read
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:07.700]   Uh, they're using gps gsm to end all of that's going to fore square or google or whoever
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:14.180]   Who is then going to check that against their range of locations to be like, oh paris is that world trade center?
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:18.580]   I'm going to center uber there just a flesh out with Patrick was saying it the
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:25.300]   The situation with user control of location data apps is getting better and I know on
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:31.400]   Android it's constantly saying hey this uh, this app is using your location is that okay and you can just write their
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.940]   Is that not right?
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:40.580]   So they both do it. They both made improvements, but um, but the problem is that like you you mentioned uber
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:44.740]   The way it really should work is at the point when you're ready to order an uber
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:50.100]   You should have an explicit option to turn on location for uber at the uber app and say
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:56.500]   Okay, i'm going to turn this on until my car comes and that it goes off automatically or something like that. That would be the user
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.460]   uh advocacy default
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:05.460]   But it's actually the industry advocacy advocacy default, which is that the uber is tracking you all the time
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.700]   And you have to actively say no
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.540]   Yeah, and you have but in addition to that
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:15.460]   That you're you should be able to say okay if I want to share my data and location data for that one moment to uber
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:21.540]   I can only consent to it being used for things related to my uber ride there you go bingo
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:27.780]   That's very true for any other services or it can't be sure to advertise is it can't be used to
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:35.700]   Be a hyper low hyper trending map. Don't put the burden on the user put the burden on these companies not to aggregate and share this data
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.260]   Because that's what's wrong
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:42.500]   Why is it sent to four square in the first place? I guess yes is a good question
[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:46.660]   So do we need legislation? That's where i'm gonna do all of you
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.620]   I used to use four square all the time in fact, uh for a long time. I was the mayor of the uh
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.180]   Twitty side studios
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:57:01.060]   But I gave it up when I learned what four scare was doing with that data now that we're renaming at the twit last past
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.100]   Studios. I wonder if I can become mayor all over again
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:08.980]   Our show today we'll get back we'll get back to the show in just a bit
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:15.220]   But first a word from last pass they they have bought the studio naming rights. You'll start to see that
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:21.140]   Next year. I'm very excited about that. I've been using last pass for 10 years long before they became a sponsor
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:23.460]   affected it's the other way around they became a sponsor because
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:28.180]   Frankly, I've been recommending last pass for as long as I can remember
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:35.140]   Remember we even went to steve gibson and said steve check this out and steve went to joe seekers the guy who created last pass joe
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:40.100]   Showed him all the software all the things that last pass does to make sure your passwords are safe
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:46.980]   And and steve gave it thumbs up. He uses last pass in that intervening years. I started using last pass
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.780]   Enterprise here at twit and in your business. It's so important
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:57.620]   I mean the reason we started using last pass enterprise at twit is is because we realized that this is a weak
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.180]   Point in our security, right?
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:04.580]   You know our our staff has the passwords to the keys to the kingdom
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:11.460]   I mean the bank accounts the websites the databases everything your data too and you got us we got to secure that right
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:18.420]   So we use last pass that way employees can access these resources, but they don't get the passwords
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:25.380]   They don't get to share the passwords. We know people share passwords or worse write the passwords on a post note and stick it to their monitor
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:30.980]   That's no good. That's not secure with last pass enterprise. It's convenient for employees
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:34.260]   They can easily log into the resources they need to access
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:39.220]   We control that access we can see what they're doing at all times the it department loves it
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:44.420]   And they never get the password so they never can share it we can revoke access at any time
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:51.460]   When a new employee comes in it's very easy to add them to onboard them into our last pass database last pass is also doing something
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:58.820]   I think really remarkable something almost I thought impossible in security they're making your company more secure
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:06.340]   and more convenient for your employees usually that's one or the other but in this case they're doing both with things like single sign-on
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.700]   Your employees can use their phone to log into the resources they need much easier than a password
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:15.620]   Multi-factor authentication that goes beyond two factor authentication
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:22.820]   It used geolocation ip address a bunch of factors to verify. Yeah, this person is who they say they are and yes
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:28.340]   They have the right to access this database or this login. That's really important for security
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.860]   But it also helps make it easier for the employees to use
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:38.660]   Last pass of course is also the best password vault generates long strong passwords and keeps track of them
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:44.660]   In a secure vault that can only be decrypted on device. That means no one else has access to it
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.780]   It's so safe. We put everything in there not just
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:52.900]   Passwords but but we Wi-Fi login software licenses employee IDs
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:57.140]   Everything is stored in this secure vault at home. I use last pass families
[00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.900]   And we put our passports in there when we travel so that it's mine
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.540]   No one else can see it, but if I need a copy of the passport
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:08.500]   I've got it right on at my fingertips same thing with social security numbers drivers license
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.860]   All the things you want to keep secure you keep in your last pass vault
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:18.500]   It is the most secure place on your device and every device to mac windows linux iOS android
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:23.540]   Every browser under the sun last pass is the first thing I install when I get a new device
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:30.180]   For home its last pass families for individuals last pass premium and don't forget last pass enterprise
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:35.540]   Their expanded business lineup has features that will improve security across your company
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:41.460]   Give you and your it department a much better window into what's going on and make it easier for your users
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:48.580]   It's amazing last pass dot com slash twit find out how they can help you last pass dot com slash twit
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:55.460]   And last pass I got a thank you for making our life easier and more secure and for supporting our best of episodes
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.940]   Thank you last pass and now
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.820]   Back to twit let's see we just talked about
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:07.700]   A four square, you know people I get a lot of email from people saying I don't want you to talk about politics on twit
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.260]   But really twit is more than just a gadget show
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:16.100]   When politics and tech intersect we need to talk about it and here's a perfect example
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:22.420]   One of the democratic candidates for president this year wants to break up google facebook even apple
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:31.140]   Elizabeth Warren um one of the front runners certainly she has the name recognition wrote a post on medium
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.780]   Well, it says team Warren
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.780]   But it's by Elizabeth Warren. Here's how we can break up
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.340]   big tech
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:46.740]   25 years ago facebook google and amazon didn't exist now. They're among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:53.460]   It's a great story, but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.060]   competitive
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.740]   markets
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.380]   Aren't we glad she writes that we now have the option of using google instead of being stuck with being
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:08.340]   Yes, but today's big tech companies have too much power too much power over economy our society our democracy
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:14.420]   And then the price process and I think this is maybe her most important point. They've hurt small businesses and stifled
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.500]   innovation
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   so she says
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:23.460]   Her administration will make big structural changes to the tech sector to promote competition including
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:28.340]   breaking up amazon facebook and google and in a conversation with niele patel
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:33.140]   Uh later this week she said and i'm gonna put apple in there as well
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:36.660]   Um, you can read the arguments
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:41.940]   Uh, you know, I think a lot of people will have a visceral reaction to this
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:45.060]   um
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:50.420]   I underlined an important part of this as did john battell these companies would be prohibited from owning and this is
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:54.820]   Something i've actually always complained about with google owning both the platform utility
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:59.540]   And any participants on that platform. It's always bothered me that youtube was owned by google
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:06.660]   Yeah, and that youtube results always showed up very high. There's even a bar of youtube results on google searches
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:13.860]   Platform utilities she writes would be required to meet a standard of fair reasonable and non discriminatory dealing with users
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.540]   That's frand that's a little different. That's a patent. Yeah
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:24.980]   Dot a dogma platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer a share data with third parties. I like that
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.580]   So let's uh, let's start with you paris what
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:33.460]   Regardless of your political bent is this viable is this doable?
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:41.540]   I think that this is viable and I think it's incredibly necessary, especially I think we're coming from a platform in ecommerce perspective
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:47.300]   um, I mean sure people think about amazon as an ecommerce company and
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.980]   Really amazon is so much more than that. I don't think most people realize the
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.740]   breadth of
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:58.100]   Amazon as a company and the things that it touches, but I suppose if we're going to just look from the ecommerce niche
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.620]   Um, amazon's a great example of why this is necessary in the fact that
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:09.860]   Uh if you go search something on amazon and probably something in the first three result top results is going to be a product from
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:13.700]   either an amazon basics like let's say we search for
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.380]   Uh charging cables for your iphone
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:24.980]   You're probably going to have an amazon basics cable pop up or if not that amazon has hundreds of private label brands
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.980]   Something that doesn't seem like it's being sold by amazon, but is manufactured
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:33.700]   shipped and fulfilled by amazon how the company does this is
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:40.340]   Since it owns the platform it realizes. Hey a lot of people are looking for iphone chargers or dog hat
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:45.860]   Or whatever we don't sell dog hats. We're going to make an amazon label dog hat so that we get both
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:47.620]   the
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:52.820]   In addition to the commission, we'd normally make off a third party dog hat being bought we get the entire
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:59.300]   Uh price of it we get the entire revenue from that and amazon has the power to direct
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:07.140]   Consumers towards its goods and to sync its competitors down in the search page to page two
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:13.620]   Which means no one will see it much less if it was at page 15 and these this sort of power is
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:20.740]   Something that has serious consequences for small businesses and innovators because why would you
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.540]   If you're a small if you're an entrepreneur or a small business
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:32.340]   Why would you invest resources to trying to figure out the next hot product that people are going to be buying online?
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:35.540]   Because you're going to have to go through amazon the minute your product ends up
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:41.540]   Succeeding amazon is probably going to copy it and or push copy it and then push you back
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:45.300]   the second or third page or push you down to search result five and
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:53.220]   You won't be making any money talks about the predatory practices amazon will use as with diapers.com. Yeah, a company comes along
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:58.500]   Uh former I think it was a former amazon employee said, oh, I know i'll just take i'll focus on diapers
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.820]   Amazon immediately undercut some kills his business and then buys it
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.700]   but uh the zapples and amazon's some of those hundreds of companies I recently
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.140]   um
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.900]   Me and my colleague louise met sakis
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.420]   Uh at the end of last year
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:17.860]   We tried to put together a list of all the different companies that amazon owned and it was one of the hardest things
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:25.220]   That we have ever done because it's absolutely unreal the hundreds and hundreds of companies that are amazon
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:31.460]   um and anytime something comes up that is a competitor towards it it purchases it uh in
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:38.740]   india in um saudi arabia and other places amazon has bought the amazon equivalents and
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:46.740]   most recently india passed um one of the strictest e-commerce regulations aimed at breaking up uh
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.900]   The monopolies of companies like amazon or walmart when it comes to e-commerce
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:54.820]   And even that has kind of only had mixed effects on the company
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:58.260]   It's required amazon to reduce its stakes
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:02.740]   How much it owns of these third party entities that it sells on its site
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:08.820]   But still amazon has so much for market share that's able to kind of get around even some of the strictest regulations
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:12.580]   So it's kind of uh, right in the algorithmic, uh, you know, uh, leo
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.500]   Downplayed what they did undercut pricing sounds like oh they have competitive pricing
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.300]   That's the thing
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.220]   No, they were using really sophisticated algorithms to in real time
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.660]   Undercut the price of literally every product on diaper.com
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:29.060]   To always be lower no matter what no matter how much money they don't care about losing money
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:34.180]   They're making money in other places and it's like literally they could just drive any company out of business
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.180]   It's always the last monopoly
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:41.940]   Use of monopoly but on steroids because it's all algorithmic and you know now they have a eye that he says
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:46.340]   Yeah, and because amazon makes all almost all of its profits from a ws
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.020]   And it has a total stronghold on the cloud services market
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:57.700]   It can sell everything on amazon and generally does for a loss if it wanted to and still be able to make a bunch of profit
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.860]   She says we would spin off amazon's marketplace google zat exchange
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:09.460]   Google search they would be called platform utilities amazon marketplace and basic school zat exchange of businesses and the exchange would be split apart
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.620]   Google search would have to be spun off
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.860]   She would take it. She would split off zappos and whole foods from amazon
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:20.500]   She would unwind the facebook acquisition of whatsapp and instagram
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:26.100]   She would take away google's ways nest and double click which is their ad platform
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.100]   She says unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:34.740]   Will put pressure on big tech companies be more responsive to user concerns about privacy
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.700]   I have to say my first reaction was oh hell no
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.580]   Because it feels like you're
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.980]   I think we have this
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.780]   In this country sometimes you're punishing them for being too successful
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:48.980]   Saying is that why it went wrong the tree got too big
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:55.460]   But I have to say the arguments you just gave paris are a really perfect example of why it's not good for society if a company
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:00.820]   Owns too much and gets too big but it's worse than that because uh as paris was eluding
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:05.140]   The the problem is that our laws are based on a world where
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.580]   um
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.020]   Okay, so, you know
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:12.660]   There's a company and you buy products from them and if they get too big and then you can break them up
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:17.300]   And then you know, it's a it's a one-to-one relationship between the customer and the company in this case
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:20.820]   There's no there's no pressure that the public can put
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.900]   on on
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.900]   Amazon when they don't even know that the companies they're buying from are amazon when they don't
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:30.660]   Understand that the profits they make from a ws are
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:37.700]   Enabling them to lose money on all kinds of markets until they crush it in which case they at which point in time they raise prices
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.700]   There was a study done where they did this in certain uh, narrow academic
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:46.900]   uh markets for books where they basically undercut
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.420]   uh
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:52.020]   These books and to the point the publishers that they were competing with
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:56.180]   Uh to the point where the publishers went out of business and as soon as the publishers went out of business
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.340]   They quadrupled their prices right that category
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.460]   I mean that's the thing kind of thing
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:03.780]   Example even if they don't do it they have the power to do it and should they have the power to do it and that's problematic
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:08.660]   She also says uh my proposals won't solve every problem we have with our big tech companies
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:11.780]   We must give people more control. This is what we were talking about earlier
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.500]   About how their personal information is collected
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   Say shared and sold and do it in a way that doesn't lock in massive
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:26.820]   Competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data. Uh, let's ask socialist europe what it thinks. Yes
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.300]   Um
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:36.660]   Honestly, I'm not even I I'm very surprised first of all that she would make this essentially her platform
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.140]   Uh, I did think the u.s was ready to consider this idea
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:47.860]   Um, I'm also very surprised that you all seem to be in favor of it. Uh, that's another thing
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:52.020]   I wasn't expecting but uh overall I'm not sure
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.220]   That uh how doable it is
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:11:03.220]   But I think it almost doesn't matter the the the key takeaway I have from this is that this is now
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:10.020]   In the conversation. This is a concern for the american public for the american
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.820]   uh, uh, uh, uh, political scene
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:17.860]   And even if it doesn't happen even if you know, she doesn't become the democratic
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:23.940]   Uh nominee even if she she doesn't even if she she does and she changes things
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.460]   Um, when she actually gets into office
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:31.060]   It's kind of putting it in the public
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:35.380]   Consciousness in a way that I think until
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:39.780]   Six months ago would have been unimaginable maybe going back a year
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:45.140]   And until she actually put it in that medium post, uh, I don't think people would have think
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:50.020]   Was possible so I was shocked. I was creating that conversation. Yeah, it's a great point
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:52.580]   The over so many overton windows are being shattered in
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:12:00.180]   American political this course the overton window is the is the range of topics that is socially acceptable to even raise
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:04.900]   And question. Yeah, and you know a few years ago. You couldn't even suggest something like this
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:09.860]   But now everybody's taking it seriously and you know the chances that Elizabeth Warren will become president
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:15.540]   And in this in 2020, you know, I don't know what the chances are but it almost doesn't matter because it's helping building a democratic
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:21.380]   Uh party platform. So even even the it might end up on the platform. Exactly. Does it help them or does it hurt them?
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.620]   I think it helps them because I think they think america
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:30.260]   In the majority supports an idea. I think I think that's probably true. What what americans are not
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:37.140]   Uh, thinking a lot about on the other hand just to play devil's advocacy
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.900]   Uh, I mean personally I I agree with patrick in the sense that I don't care
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:47.380]   Like if they if they break up facebook and are some of our other and google and some of our beloved companies apple, etc
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:52.580]   A lot of people's instinct instinctive reaction to say I love the products. I love this company
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.260]   I don't want them to be harmed
[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:59.700]   But you know, it's gonna you know if there were three apples that wouldn't be terrible and all the shareholders would now be
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:06.180]   The owners of three actually could he create more absolute. I mean alphabet did it voluntarily sort of
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:15.940]   Um, but but the larger implication is that these companies are global giants. I mean facebook google amazon's becoming a global giant
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.500]   Apples obviously a global giant
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:23.620]   Somebody's going to be a global giant and if we dismantle the american global giants
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:30.820]   Then the chinese global giants are going to become the new global giants and we got to think about whether we want that and I wish europe would step up
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:34.900]   Um, in terms of there's so much technology in europe
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:42.900]   But the funding and other cultural aspects of the startup culture aren't happening. So where's the where's the french google?
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.980]   Where's the german facebook?
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:53.540]   Why is it there? I mean, there is a french search and we ask ourselves that that question all the time. I think there is
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:58.100]   This I have no idea what i'm talking about but I think there is a lot
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:03.860]   Of market size that is problematic in europe
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:08.900]   Even though we try to create a single market and we have in many ways
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:15.380]   The language barrier is one thing then even with the uh harmonization of
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:19.300]   Laws there are still variations with different
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:30.020]   Parts of the the u in the us and in china you can start your business and immediately have access to what is 250 million?
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:34.660]   Customers it's a little bit more complicated for us. So I think that plays into it
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:39.860]   Uh, I also think as much as as it pains me to say it
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:43.060]   Are our
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:49.460]   Tax regimen or however you want to call it is maybe a little bit less friendly to aggressive
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:52.180]   Entrepreneurship that's possible
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.380]   um
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.820]   but
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:59.860]   The the we have now lived in a world where we have you know
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:07.780]   The the as we call them in france the gaffam. So google amazon facebook apple and microsoft are ruling the world
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:12.340]   We know what it looks like. We know what the positive things are. We know what the negative things are
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.340]   um
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:18.420]   I think it would necessarily be a horrible thing to try out
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:21.060]   uh
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:25.140]   Try breaking them down and and seeing what happens and maybe it would open up
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:26.340]   uh
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:30.180]   We were a little bit slow in europe and in other countries to get on the
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:34.420]   internet train and that's and maybe it was too late
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.500]   Um
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.700]   As you know baltimore for three weeks now has been shut down
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:47.940]   By ransome where it's frozen thousands of computers shut down email disrupted real estate sales water bills health alerts and other services
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:51.140]   Here's the bullet and they put on the city of baltimore web page
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:55.060]   The city of baltimore is currently unable to send or receive email
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.860]   If you need assistance call us
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:00.260]   Um
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:04.660]   The ransome hundred thousand dollars city officials to their credit refuse to pay it
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:09.540]   And aside no, we uh, we just I just read an article. I think it was on mother board that
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.860]   A lot of the companies that get hired to remediate ransome. Where what do they do?
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:18.660]   They pay the fine. They add 10 20 for profit
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:24.820]   Really job done. Oh, so do not pay the bitcoin ransomists. Okay. I'm just saying
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:29.460]   But here is what this is the great writing, uh, again from the new york times from pro rathans shane
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:32.740]   Here's what frustrated city employees in residence. Do not know
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:36.340]   A key component of the malware that cyber criminals use in the attack
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:45.060]   Was developed at tax payer expense a short drive down the baltimore washington parkway at the national security agency. This is
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.300]   Peacetevident
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:53.460]   This is eternal blue. Uh, you remember this shadow brokers leak of a bunch of nsa exploits some years ago
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:56.980]   I mean ever nsa never really explained how it happened. Although if you piece it together
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:02.260]   It sounded like an nsa contractor decided to take those files home with him
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.820]   So not so he could steal them. So he could work at home
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:10.660]   He was running a kaspersky antivirus on his machine one of the things kaspersky does is quarantine
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:14.900]   threats whether intentionally or not kaspersky recognized
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:19.220]   That the guy had a bunch of really good hacks on his machine
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:24.100]   So they quarantined him and sent him back to the home office, which happens to be in moscow
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:32.580]   um the russian secret police apparently have people working at kaspersky it's unknown how close kaspersky is to the
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:36.900]   russian secret police, but they certainly have access to those quarantine files and
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:39.620]   Yeah, the rest is uh is history
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:45.380]   The thing I said on the radio show today, I think this and I wanted regular people here not keeks is
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:52.900]   This is the problem the nsa the top spy agency in the united states the most security focused
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:56.180]   These guys really know their stuff couldn't keep this stuff
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:03.220]   Internal for long and you want us to put back doors in all the encryption. Thank you
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:08.660]   Right, right if you can't keep these secrets are you gonna keep the back door secret?
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:11.540]   You can't well you couldn't even if you didn't so
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:17.860]   So what that means is anything any any weakness you put in any software is eventually going to be
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:22.820]   Used by bad guys against the united states and and this is leo
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:25.540]   This is where I really want to give microsoft credit
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:31.300]   Because they really took a risk in moving forward and uh, you know, they came out
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:36.420]   We should say eternal blue is an smb exploit right it's an old version of smb microsoft's
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:44.900]   File sharing sure absolutely, but their legal team has come forward and they've had a lot to say about the nsa stockpiling zero-day
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:50.820]   Weapons and talking about how we need to have a a national ban on them doing that
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:55.860]   Because what happens is these zero days are out there it prevents people from patching it
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:59.300]   And rather than kind of using this for cyber warfare
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:02.580]   And being able to use it to get their own way
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:11.140]   We should have them working proactively with microsoft with other architecture to plug these holes and address it because it's exactly as you said
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:15.940]   It's just going to get you know weaponized against the american people from the same article eternal blue
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.660]   The smb exploit that allowed these
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:25.620]   Malware programs to be warmable so that it's one thing if you get one computer in the baltimore city government with ransomeware
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:29.380]   But what happens is it worm uses eternal blue to worm its way to all the computers
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:40.180]   Yeah, eternal blue was so valuable former nsa employees said that the agency never seriously considered alerting microsoft about the vulnerabilities and held on to it for more than five
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:48.740]   Years before the breach forced its head the breach was two years ago. So for seven years that smb one flaws existed right?
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.540]   So but but briana let me let me please how are you know
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:58.180]   Clearly you know
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:04.740]   National warfare struggles espionage is all going to become cyber based right? That's where we're headed right?
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:14.580]   If r r if our nsa r our r nsa is not allowed to develop tools to do cyber warfare
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:21.060]   Then aren't we tying both hands behind her back? I think it's a good argument for that
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:25.620]   Have you read uh countdown to zero day about stuxnet source? It's a it's a great book
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:29.940]   It's a fantastic book and I I won't like go into all the details but I will say
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:38.660]   the the technical wizardry that they use to basically shut down the centrifuges in uh iran it was brilliant like it's a
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:45.940]   It's certainly that kind of cyber warfare is going to know lives were lost but it's kind of an optimal
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:52.740]   Solution but there was a collateral a lot of collateral damage because this worm was spread all over the world. So look
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:57.700]   By the way, if you fire up a windows machine that is not patched for stuxnet
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.660]   You will get it. Yes. That's endemic on the net. It just constantly out there. Absolutely
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:07.140]   So this isn't all or nothing leo right like it's we live in a dangerous world
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.140]   We do need to take this seriously
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.980]   But in this particular case the nsa was unable to keep this safe
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:20.500]   And I would invite you to say for five years until somebody who deserves to get that there is no patch for a human stupidity t-shirt
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.740]   Decided to take to do work from home
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:28.740]   If you're working at the nsa you don't take i'm pretty sure I mean I could be wrong rules may have changed
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:33.620]   I don't know anybody the nsa that well, but we spent yeah, I got spent a couple like a day with the nsa
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:37.940]   They have some pretty they're they're uptight people right they're really uptight
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:41.700]   Um and they have rules in place and i'm pretty sure
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:46.420]   Those didn't stop edwards snowden and then several years later. Yes, well there is no patch for humans
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.980]   That could be the short version right um, you know
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.340]   Until the government is not run by humans i think we got a problem
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:59.700]   I feel like we're not going to give up developing these tools right right but I think there is an analog here and that is
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:06.660]   Biologic weapons. So there is also a lot of incentive for governments to create biological weapons
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:10.900]   But we have a con i don't know if it's janeva convention, but we have an agreement among governments
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:17.140]   That they won't do it and the reason is these pathogens that probably do exist in labs i'm thinking
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:24.660]   Should they get out would wipe out the population of the uh of the country right so so there are
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:27.540]   Restrictions on this kind of warfare. Maybe we need
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:37.380]   Is it even possible to get people like iran souti arabia north korea china russia to agree to some sort of cyber
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:43.940]   Moratorium i think if you're talking to people at the nsa if you're talking to infosec experts
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.620]   They are talking about this the united states cannot go it alone
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:55.700]   Insolve these kinds of problems if we're talking a truly unilaterally disarming if we did exactly so we've got to do exactly what you're talking about
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:59.140]   Form form alliances with other nations or standards
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:04.820]   Well, it's not great. Yeah, we could change that we can change that
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:10.260]   So, you know the truth is we just can't isolate ourselves. We need to engage with other people
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:13.940]   Yeah, I mean, uh, yeah
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:16.180]   It's so tempting to say what's true
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.020]   But this is all but we got to try
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:22.100]   This is all one giant mess, you know for example diane fison hates cryptography
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:26.580]   Fundamentally i don't know how she doesn't get it. I don't know if she i think she totally gets it
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:30.580]   But her priorities in terms of you know national security
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:36.260]   That's much more important to her than than maybe not every bank account in the planet getting hacked
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.780]   I mean, it's it's
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:41.060]   You know the the prior you talked to people at different levels of government
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:44.500]   One of the fun things about defcon is who you run into drunk at two in the morning
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.220]   Yeah
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:50.020]   And people who are are at the front lines have a very different perspective from people at home
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:53.300]   And if somebody spends their entire day going, you know, we get you know, we get hit by this
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:58.020]   We get by this we get by this we give it this and people are constantly the whole cyber warfare thing
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:02.100]   You know, there's little skirmishes going on all the time. There's all sorts of mayhem going on
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.100]   I just I just read an article about
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.060]   uh
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:07.140]   There's a little island off of manhattan
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:09.620]   that uh
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:13.060]   We do practice cyber attacks on the grid
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:20.420]   And it was just in the times today. I think and and every six months they bring down the grid and see how fast we can get it back
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:26.180]   This island, uh, that nobody's allowed to visit. It's a private, you know military installation
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:29.940]   I just want to bounce off what you were saying with that diane feinstein
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:35.940]   Um, you know, she voted to reauthorize the patreon act. She voted to basically she's very against cryptography
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:44.260]   In my experience, I think it's faulty thinking to think any particular political party is going to come to your rescue on this issue
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:48.020]   When I talked to people i'm not talking about political party. I'm talking about one of the senators
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.580]   It's going to be a diamond
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:56.420]   To the companies that generate the majority of the revenue absolutely in her state and a lot of the citizens
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:02.980]   I'm writing as a democrat. I think it's time to for us to have a conversation saying we have not been good on this issue
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:09.940]   And the axis of conflict here isn't one political party versus another. It's informed versus uninformed
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:13.220]   Yeah, and then we just need to figure out how to separate all the special interests
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:19.700]   It's not just in the us though. And that's the real problem because um, uh, uh, eternal blue was first used by the north koreans
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.780]   They they used it, uh
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:25.620]   To bring down the british hospital system the national health system
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:30.100]   Uh, that was the first use of it. Uh, they brought down german railroads
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:34.180]   200 organizations 200 000 i'm sorry organizations around the world
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:42.580]   Russia used it with not petya so north korea had wanakrae which used eternal blue not petcha used eternal blue it was aimed at ukraine
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:49.060]   But it ended up leaking out fedex cost them 400 million murk cost them 670 million
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:53.060]   So these companies could reasonably lobby and say look we got to do something
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:55.380]   But I think you also have to convince these countries
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:59.780]   And I think it's a case of you have to say the damage the collateral damage to your
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:03.300]   Promise how do you convince north koreans? Yeah, here's this here's the island by the way
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:09.540]   How have you ever been to plum island patrick no off long island sound no well you can't go there good
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:17.940]   And uh, it's uh, it's where darpa runs war games for a massive cyber attack. Oh my goodness
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:21.780]   Yeah, it's uh, it's owned by the department of only insecurity
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.820]   Uh major attractions are a defunct lighthouse
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:30.420]   And a center that studies infectious animal diseases strangely though their power goes out every six months
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:35.540]   It's a it's an exercise. I suspect they fire up the janitors
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:39.940]   The generators before they they run really should kill the power on the bow button
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.820]   No, yeah
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.940]   Well, I think they probably warned them ahead of time
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:52.820]   So every six months darpa fairies fairies over experts on a ferry and a boat
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:59.620]   Yeah, who worked to jumpstart a dead grid while warning off a series of cyber threats at least we're war gaming this stuff
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:02.260]   We're preparing
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:06.740]   Got tell you leah i've had some scary conversations
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:10.740]   Have you kind of secret deep deep background?
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:17.860]   Well, I I would just say sometimes you try to talk to people in positions of power about this and you expect there to be a certain
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:21.140]   amount of technological literacy and
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:28.180]   My experience is when it's not quite there. Here's the other issue north korea is like the battle star galactica
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:31.140]   Right
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.260]   You know what i'm saying? They've cut themselves off from modern technology
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:38.420]   So you can't really say to them or you got to watch out want to cry could bite you too
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:44.900]   No, it can't oh, so we just do an mp above the country. Oh, don't say that Patrick people think you're serious
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:50.820]   It wouldn't affect them that wouldn't affect them. They're the battle star freaking galactica
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.700]   They're using phones with wires and dials
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:28:00.980]   We'll talk about emp's later. We'll break those two. Does it break a fine western electric phone made of hard rubber?
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:03.060]   That's a really good question. I bet it doesn't
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:08.420]   I've been no new trun bomb. We'll blast that out of the sky
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:13.700]   Um, so the department of homeland security last year issued a dire warning
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:18.180]   That state and local governments are getting hit by a particularly destructive malware
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:26.180]   That is relying on eternal blue microsoft. This is the microsoft center the eternal blue tracking center
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:32.340]   Notice they have one of those fine surface hub. Mostly. I just like that at least one person's wearing like a camouflage thing
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:37.860]   You can't see me. I'm invisible right now. You don't know where I am. Well, it's
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:43.860]   This is this seems this feels kind of staged. I don't know. Maybe it's just me it looks kind of staged
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:48.660]   But it's funny right because there's a there's a blog that I love to read called granola shaga
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:54.500]   And what he talks about mostly is how things are evolving in communities and why big box
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:58.500]   He walks through the sort of you know, how
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:05.300]   Towns and cities got to where they are with the ex-urban production and then how big box stores are dying and this sort of endless series of
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:07.860]   I understand. Yes, and that's what it's coming in
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:11.380]   You know, they can barely run their own infrastructure without having to deal with upgrading
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:16.980]   Welcome to petaluma where the housing office is open four hours a week. Oh, good luck getting a permit
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:17.940]   Oh my gosh
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:21.620]   And the streets are decaying because nobody has the money to fill the potholes
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:29.140]   And this is this is a typical excerpt small town, you know, I mean, I think this is I can't imagine what the cyber security is in city
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:32.820]   All but well, the answer is like not korea. They don't have a network
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:35.380]   Hello
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:40.420]   I mean the answer is obviously that there's not going to be any leo and this is why there's very clear
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:47.540]   Clearly a federal role to play in securing this if the nsa is going to you know stockpile these weapons
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:53.620]   We need to have a process to be able to get emergency patches out and that's why I do think we need to be
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:30:00.500]   Funding free and open source software for you know, local city governments to use maybe that's one solution
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:06.420]   Yeah, stop using proprietary software. It's a nightmare. It locks all these yeah open ssh was
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:10.900]   A mess for you know, we found out it in a mess for years fair point
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:15.940]   But as I've gotten to as I've gotten to know every single you know independent government
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:22.660]   They get locked into a different contract with another vendor then you've got technical debt and you can't swap it over
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:27.300]   This is clearly a case for federal leadership and the last thing I would say is you know
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:34.740]   I forget what year was exactly was it 94 that we closed down the office of technology assessment in washington
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:43.060]   It makes no sense. It makes no sense. This was a very I think a very well-run agency that was helping members of congress understand technology
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:46.100]   Now they've got nothing
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.420]   Now they've got jack dorsey. Yep
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:54.100]   In an interview in march michael rogers the admiral who was in charge of the nsa during the leak
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:56.740]   said this
[01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:58.660]   well
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:04.980]   I don't think he said well, but he's thinking it if toyota makes pickup trucks and someone takes a pickup truck and wells an explosive
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:09.780]   Device into the front and crashes through a perimeter into a crowd of people is that toyota's responsibility
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:13.860]   The nsa wrote an exploit that was never designed to do what was done
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:17.460]   Um, yeah, no
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:21.380]   It's exactly
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:27.380]   Microsoft's response tombert corporate vice president of consumer trust
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:36.580]   And you can't compare cyber weapons to pickup trucks or the nsa to toyota. Yeah, the uh, these exploits are developed and kept secret by governments
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:41.140]   This is exactly what you were saying brianna for the express purpose of using them as weapons or espionage tools
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:47.460]   They're inherently dangerous when someone takes that they're not strapping a bomb to it. It is already a bomb
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.180]   Yeah, I was gonna say this is more like if somebody finds a bomb
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:56.660]   Outside like on the front lawn that fell off the nsa truck and then welds it onto their pickup truck then i'm kind of getting the analogy
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:00.900]   But it's it's so there is I didn't know this but at the end of the article
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:06.580]   Last year microsoft along with google and facebook joined 50 countries and signing on to a
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:09.540]   You know call by french president immmanuel macrall
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:15.860]   The parris call for trust and security and cyberspace to end malicious cyber activities and peacetime
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:20.740]   So 50 countries sign it, but who didn't sign it china iran israel north korea russia
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:26.260]   In the united states right so the biggest actors the ones that are most likely to get into a scrap
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:31.780]   Yeah, right are not participating and I understand why because they say but we don't want our hands time off course
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:38.980]   I it's not how I would go it makes us more unsafe to not be working with other people so
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:45.220]   I think that there is an eternal optimism in these agencies that no no no this time will keep it
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:52.820]   To ourselves this time nobody's gonna get it's gonna be fun. This time. It's gonna be fun. I really think that that's how they that's how they think right?
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.020]   Yeah
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:33:00.180]   Yep ransomware was a big story in 2019. No surprise there. I have a feeling there'll be a big story in 2020

[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:46.820]   premium fabrics they make it easy to shop on mac weld and uh these innovative fabrics they use are
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:50.100]   Wonderful for instance their silver line of underwear
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:55.220]   They also have t-shirts they're made with a natural antimicrobial material
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:59.380]   That eliminates older and keeps you feeling fresh and cool all day

[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:38.980]   I've actually thrown out gym clothes from other companies and replaced them with mac weld and this is a beautiful polo comfy
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:40.500]   stylish

[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:36.980]   That's really that's really generous of you. We we really appreciate that
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:41.140]   This was the year that facebook got that big
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:46.580]   $5 billion fine. I think it's the largest fine in ftc history
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:50.180]   But you'll never believe what happened next
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:52.260]   watch
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:55.940]   The largest fine in the history of the ftc 5 billion
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.580]   Dollars that sounds like a lot of money, right?
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:05.380]   That's a good dr. evil except facebook's stock price went up after the fine six billion dollars
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:09.380]   So mark zuckerberg is smiling because he made money
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:12.980]   He made money
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:19.220]   I guess facebook was smart. They had said in their annual and their quarterly report that they expected this 5 billion
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:25.620]   They budgeted it and so they prepared the market right and then when that fine actually was 5 billion as usual
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:29.780]   You you sell on the rumor you buy on the news or you buy on the news and you sell on the rumor
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:32.420]   I can't remember but whatever it was good news
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:39.940]   Everybody laments the political division of society, but both republicans and democrats can get behind crushing silica valley
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:45.140]   Yeah, that is a non partisan issue as americans so caroline is $5 billion
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.900]   Uh a slap on that sounds like a lot of money. Is it a slap on the wrist?
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:53.140]   It kind of seems like a yeah drop in the bucket. I don't know
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.380]   I remember a couple of months ago
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:37:00.980]   There were a couple of other figures that were being thrown around and it seems like they were potentially going to be hit with a lot more
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:07.140]   Money, but it really doesn't seem like this is going to have an impact on them at all caris swisher said you really want to find
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:10.420]   them at a zero to the five make it 50 billion
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:12.660]   Elizabeth Warren
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.140]   Said facebook made five billion in profits in the first three months of the year actually that's not true
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:23.540]   I think was uh revenue not profits the company's too big to oversee and this drop in the bucket penalty confirms that
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:29.540]   It is true that I mean look at anything with a b is a lot of money for any company
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:34.980]   But it isn't you know facebook had 15 billion in revenue
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:42.340]   Oh, I'm sorry it is 15 billion in revenue last quarter 22 billion in profit. So it was it was one quarter profit
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:45.380]   um
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:48.100]   You could see the stock jump there mike isek said
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:56.980]   The real story is that facebook says shares surged with that fine. So clearly the market saying yeah slap on the wrist
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:59.380]   Yeah, what do what do
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:04.820]   You're not on facebook fact I use use an example mike elgan because you have mike's nice book
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:09.300]   Yes, so what I did was last year. I said I was getting off fourth of july
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.180]   And I spent the whole all these months this year
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:18.020]   harassing and and criticizing facebook course that it no good at all because they were censoring my posts clearly
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:22.580]   Um, but I replaced it with a google folder. I call my nice book
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:27.380]   And you can go and it's a public folder. So anybody can follow it just as they would on facebook
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:32.660]   Yes, so if you search for mike elgan nice book you'll find links to it and I invite you all but this is my personal
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:36.180]   This is my family. So it's really it's the kind of pictures you would have put it exactly
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:38.020]   Is there text though or is it just pictures?
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.900]   Text you can you can do posts where do you put your dank memes?
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:42.100]   Can you put them up there too?
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:45.220]   You cannot so each person's this is the beauty of it
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:47.220]   This is how social network should work
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:51.460]   Only I can post in my nice book and I can follow your nice book and then I see it in the stream
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:55.060]   So if you're on google photos and you go to sharing which nobody ever does
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:58.340]   It's the it's the it's the tab on the far right
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:03.780]   You get all the stuff that's been shared with you all the you know, and it's it's kind of like a social network
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:09.700]   So I think google can turn it into a lot of your nice book. Yeah, there it is. Yeah, so
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:16.100]   I could make one of these what what if I wanted to make one I would just set up a sharing and say public
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:21.380]   Yes, and it's kind of I believe that's the default actually that it's public and then you just share the link
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:26.340]   Okay, uh with family and friends by email people can choose their own notifications
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.740]   So some people get it on their phones and people get an email
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:32.180]   Some people don't get the notifications. They just see it in google photos when they go
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:37.700]   But it's beautiful. These photos are full quality if you click on these photos. They're full quality much better than Facebook
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:42.020]   And you can you can add little uh, you know comments
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.900]   You can like things and it's an it's a stream without ads
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:49.140]   That's mics a wife by the way amira who's so beautiful sitting in a restaurant
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.940]   That apparently has parking meters called the naughty pig that's on sunset boulevard. Oh, okay
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:40:00.660]   But it's it's a wonderful alternative because really what we want to do on facebook is we want to
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:07.620]   See a stream of our people we care about and the photos because I say get all the time I say get off facebook
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:12.580]   I'm off facebook caroline. Do you you have to it's an occupational hazard be on all the networks probably
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:15.460]   Yeah, yeah, I feel like it would be
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:22.100]   Sort of irresponsible for me to like not even know what's going on. Do you kind of wish you couldn't you could like get rid of
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.260]   Instagram? I wish I could
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:26.260]   I wish I could it would be nice
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:32.180]   The strange thing is that a lot of my peers still use facebook for event invitations
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:36.340]   And I've noticed people a little bit more recently using different types of forums
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:43.700]   But it almost seems like for a lot of people at least in my immediate social circle that facebook is still a way to
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:46.260]   Guarantee that someone is going to be able to see something but
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:50.500]   I don't know. I want to go back to the days of like personal websites
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:53.460]   Well, you know this early
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:55.700]   Yeah, I'm sorry to to to step on your
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:41:01.780]   Your comment there caroline, but um, this is what I hear I've talked in lots and lots of people all over the world
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:06.660]   Leo because in europe but you have a blog I have a blog but I know lots of people in europe who use
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:11.060]   One two or three social things and those things are always facebook properties
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:14.740]   So I know people do facebook instagram and whatsapp or they just instagram and whatsapp
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:18.900]   And it's and that was one of the hardships for me is when I got rid of facebook
[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:21.700]   I felt like well, I should also give it a face instagram
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:26.340]   I didn't really use whatsapp but I should also I should get through to all three if I have any one of them on my phone
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:28.740]   I've given facebook an entree into my life absolutely
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:34.500]   And this is the interesting thing about whatsapp americans don't use whatsapp much, but everybody else
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:38.580]   It's well and that's what I hear when I say get off facebook what I universally hear is
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:43.140]   That's a that's a privileged point of view. I can't get off
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:46.820]   This is the problem with facebook where we're on the brink where we
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:49.380]   Everybody is some countries it's the internet
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:53.780]   Well, exactly and some people some lots of lots of people say I don't use the internet. I use facebook
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:42:00.020]   Right and and so it's aol for the 21st century and the scheme that mark zuckerberg is hatching
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:04.980]   As we sit here is he's trying to turn it into we chat so in china we chat is everything
[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:10.580]   It's an e-commerce that's why leprechaun. That's why he's got a currency because he wants this to be everything goes through facebook
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.940]   And so we're already like everybody I talked to says
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:18.260]   Oh, I'm not going to get off facebook because I need it for this reason or that reason caroline has her reasons
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:23.620]   Everybody has a reason why they need facebook or instagram or whatsapp and this is a problem
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:29.060]   We shouldn't care line. I thought I had heard that younger people thought maybe maybe you're not as young as you look
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:34.420]   But younger people said facebook is like your parents social network
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:40.420]   And there and people under 30 say are are snapchat or tiktok there are other places
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:46.340]   Right, right. Yeah, I think there's definitely still that reputation
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:49.140]   You but in college did you use facebook?
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:54.580]   My daughter is 27 still is on facebook because that's how she stays in touch with her college friends
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:57.780]   I did yeah, I mean
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:02.580]   Facebook was used in terms of like finding college roommates freshman year
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:08.580]   Um doing introductions and that's sort of pivoted on to instagram, which is you know again, still a facebook property
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:13.460]   So it seems like you're still sort of relying on this biggest common denominator
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:21.060]   Like there's this assumption that you have an account on at least one facebook. It's it is really the reason
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:24.500]   Facebook is an incumbent and it will be hard to unseat is
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:28.500]   So-called network effect you have to be where everybody is
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:34.100]   So, uh, I guess apple had some sort of shindig on tuesday
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:41.220]   By innovation only there were a few people who said okay if you're gonna have an invitation that says by innovation
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:44.260]   you best innovate
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:46.420]   Devindra
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:51.860]   Now first of all you probably already have an iPhone, but you can't say it because it's embargo
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:55.380]   I don't have it, but I have touched them and they're very nice
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:00.980]   Oh, you could say that a video phone. Um, yes
[01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:03.700]   The iPhone 11
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:08.660]   It was a weird it was kind of a weird event for apple first of all they had so much to talk about that they had to jam it
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:13.140]   And they didn't start with their traditional ode to money making and the stores
[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:18.900]   But they kicked they kicked right into apple rk plus and then tv plus and then they went to the watch
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:22.580]   By the time they got to the iphone which I thought was going to be this story of the
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.780]   The hour they only announced one the iphone 11
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:32.660]   I said the most successful iphone this year was the iphone 10r here's its successor the iphone 11 now with two lenses
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:40.900]   And I thought well this is interesting the the big I think the big story there was the price which is 50 bucks less than the iphone 10r
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:43.460]   At its launch 699
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:49.300]   Uh, and then they said oh oh and by the way there are some other iphones the iphone
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:54.820]   Pro iphone 11 pro and the iphone 11
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.300]   Flowmax
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.460]   I mean sorry pro max
[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:01.460]   I say flow max because I can't remember
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:06.820]   The all the all they all have slow fees. There's a lot. They all have slow fees slow mo
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:09.940]   Selfies
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:15.940]   So, um these this is apple is now in a tick-tock-tock situation, aren't they since the iphone 6
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:20.180]   They don't used to be every other euro being s and kind of the same form factor
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:26.100]   But a little bit improved and then a big improvement the next year like the 10 was a big improvement, but the 10s
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:28.260]   Was a talk
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:30.660]   And this is really a talk to the talk. Isn't it?
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:38.340]   I think it kind of that speaks to like how uh smartphone upgrade cycles are working now too like most people keep their phones two or three years
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:41.940]   Um, it kind of makes sense. There's no point like killing yourself to
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:46.340]   Bring something new and groundbreaking out every two years when you can kind of
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:50.180]   Coast on how people actually buy these phones and take some more time with that hardware
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:54.420]   Uh, so yeah, I'm not surprised that the series phones aren't too revolutionary
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:59.060]   It is nice having an extra lens across the line. Uh, the three lenses on the pros
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:05.620]   Uh, that's gonna be really interesting. Um, they really cleaned up the phone names too because the 10r and the 10s
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:09.700]   Those were all really dumb and confusing because it was a Roman numeral. So it looked like x
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:15.780]   It's just it was a mess. So iphone 11 nice and clean. I feel like i'm pro just like macbook and macbook pro
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:20.580]   It's all good. Um, and I think we're all expecting the big big upgrade to be next years
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:28.100]   Uh, when we're gonna see 5g most likely the 2020 iphones. Yeah, but is there such a thing georgia as a professional phone?
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:31.300]   I mean really
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:34.340]   Do you know professional for the phone that you have in your pocket
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:40.180]   Better than but you know, no, I understand a mac and a mac pro
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:45.300]   I understand a macbook and a macbook pro. Yeah, or even an ipad and ipad pro, right?
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:51.860]   Yeah, that's not your start to stretch it. Yeah, iPhone more pro is just easy and quick and it makes you feel a little bit more elite
[01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:54.580]   so you know, but
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:59.780]   They need something that's short and snappy and easy and people understand that you're getting a little bit more for it
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:05.300]   And I think the the thing for me that makes it pro is like as someone who spends like
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:10.820]   Literally all day on your phone because I need to like listening to podcasts or making software that's making podcasts
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:15.940]   It's like I just need more battery life and I think the fact that this year apple finally put more
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:18.740]   More battery in the back of these things
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:23.300]   Um, you know for me like having that extra battery life is what makes it pro
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:26.100]   Actually, we know it's more battery
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:31.460]   You you make a huge case so it now let me ask because I wasn't clear is this five
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:36.580]   So the iFAM pro max are saying has five hours more battery life than what?
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:42.420]   The 10s max like they're equivalent so it is it is head to head it is more but we don't we don't know
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:49.060]   Five hours. Yeah, we do know that the new display they're saying I think the new oleid is like 15 percent more efficient
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:54.980]   And the the new processor is likely more efficient too. So these this is where the battery life is coming from probably
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:48:01.540]   I've also been hearing from a lot of people have installed iOS 13 the public beta and 13 one that that's much more efficient
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:04.820]   They're getting much better battery life. So it's great. It's on all three fronts
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:09.860]   Apple the new processor is the a 13 bionic
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:12.820]   Is that right?
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:18.980]   Beliefs though. Yeah, sorry. So I think I think that's the that's the other annoying thing by the way with the pro designation
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:25.220]   Uh last year the 10r and the ten s phones had the exact same processor. Yes, and that was a big price difference now
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:29.140]   It's like an iphone 11 basic and iphone pro still with the same processor
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:29.540]   Yeah
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:33.380]   And that's I I don't know I kind of wish there was a little more of a bump there
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:37.540]   Just to really earn that pro title because right now we you have the extra camera
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:43.060]   Uh, you have the oleid really nice refresh old lids greens and the kind of slick not slick
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:50.980]   But like the matte glass back and the stainless steel construction. That's kind of all you're getting. That's surgical stainless surgically
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:55.220]   Yeah surgical grade. Yeah, that was really weird because like i'm not going to perform
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:57.940]   an open heart surgery with my phone
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:01.460]   I could see that in a scalpel, but a phone. I don't know
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:06.100]   Yeah, I think for me the most frustrating thing about the whole
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:12.660]   Um, you know 11 11 pro 11 pero max is that as you can see here. They ship the case
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:16.180]   For your new phone. Oh, you get ahead of the actual new
[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:18.500]   I hate that you get a box from ai
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:20.740]   And you go oh boy. It's here. It's
[01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:23.380]   Oh my word is here
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:30.820]   And you open the box and it's just the flipping case a lot while you really you really all in on apple because you bought the apple clear case
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:32.820]   Which is $40
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:39.380]   And as far as I could tell functionally identical to the 799 one I bought surgical grade clear plastic
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:41.700]   Okay, that's what you're paying for
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:46.420]   But you know it'll fit just right so that's probably important
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:56.340]   Um, okay. So the so the this is a seven nanometer processor. This is actually I think apple deserves more credit for its custom processors than they're getting
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:03.860]   Uh, this looked like and it was interesting because they brought somebody for the first time I can ever remember from the processor group up on stage
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:06.820]   Oh, yeah, it was like an intel keyed out for for a second there
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:12.580]   I mean, it was like what? We're not half billion transistors or something. It was just it's mind boggling what they're doing
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:19.860]   I think they're my guess is they're highlighting these guys because they're eventually going to be making processors for the entire kit
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:22.260]   Right all the way up all the way up to the computers
[01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:28.100]   Yeah, I think if we're seeing snapdragon laptops already and you know windows machines running on snapdragon
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:32.420]   So they they are kind of setting the stage. It just kind of makes sense like oh by next year
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:38.100]   If we see a macbook powered by the a14 or whatever, uh, we wouldn't be too surprised. I guess
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:41.860]   This week apple joined amazon
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:43.780]   Netflix
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:50.420]   In the realm of being an entertainment provider on their own with apple original programming on the new apple tv plus service
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:57.700]   Which debuted november first free if you bought a qualifying apple hardware product in the last couple of months
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:00.180]   and uh for a year
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:03.140]   And uh 4.99 a month for everyone else
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:09.860]   Launching okay. I'm going to say it. This is whoever the marketing genius who came up with this one. They get a cookie
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:15.220]   apple is boasting that this service is the world's first originals only
[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:17.060]   streaming service
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:22.500]   What that means is that they didn't buy any catalog content. There's nothing derivative here. J's
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:29.140]   There's no sitcoms or no repeats or or detective shows from the 70s or anything that you've seen before
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:36.020]   It's only a handful of shows that were made specifically for apple tv plus and there is an argument to be made that
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:39.300]   With such a limited supply of programming
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:42.900]   It's kind of hard for apple to make the case that this service is worth buying
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:47.940]   Then again, if you bought any apple hardware in the last couple of months, guess what you can get it for a year for free
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:50.740]   instead of having to pay for 99 a month, so
[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:54.420]   The services out the the shows are out
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:52:00.100]   They're not doing a weekly release or a binge drop. They're doing a hybrid where they've released
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:04.180]   I think three episodes of a lot of shows some things they've dropped a whole season
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:08.580]   But they are going to do weekly releases of their uh top line shows from this point
[01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:12.020]   So rather than doing the netflix thing quite honestly they don't have enough shows right they would
[01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:16.980]   Drop them all and then they would go away for several months and nothing would happen on the service
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:20.740]   So instead they're doing weekly releases after in uh
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:26.660]   The case of things like c and the morning show and for all mankind dropping three episodes on day one
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:32.820]   So we can talk about this is from a strategy perspective if you've seen the shows we could talk about whether the shows are any good or not
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:37.220]   I'm gonna bet that they're better than planet of the apps, but beyond that. I don't know dan
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:43.380]   Uh, what have you seen of apple tv plus? I've watched the first three episodes of the morning show
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:47.860]   Um and that that's so far. That's it. Uh as far as the originals thing go
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:52.580]   It did remind me of I think it was maybe in the late 90s or early 2000s nbc
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:54.980]   had a
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.020]   A slogan that they would run sometimes when they were reruns if you haven't seen it
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:52:59.300]   It's new to you
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:01.140]   And I always thought that was such a brilliant
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:05.220]   Tautology of like well of course like if you haven't seen it it's new and in the same case
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:09.940]   I feel like that's sort of what apple's spinning here. Um, I I've actually like the morning show
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:11.700]   I know that's received kind of mixed reviews
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:19.380]   It's something that kind of appeals to me and it's un I feel like it reflects certainly that they put a lot of money into the show
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:21.140]   Uh, it looks good
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:26.980]   It's got really top talent even down to like the supporting castor like there's a lot of faces that you recognize
[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:31.220]   Uh, is it the kind of thing that's essentially going to go out and win say an Emmy?
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:36.100]   I don't think so. I don't think that it will uh, but I think it's a solid effort
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:40.180]   And it's enjoyable enough that when I finished the first episode I kept watching
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:43.780]   Uh, and if there had been more I probably would have kept watching them by now
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:47.940]   So, you know in some to some extent that's all that really matters
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:51.380]   Uh, and from a larger business question, there is a
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:54.260]   There is a question of what success looks like for apple here
[01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:57.380]   Obviously if you're giving away your service for a whole year to
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:02.180]   Most of at least your most devoted customers probably the people most likely to pay for the service
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:05.140]   Uh, then obviously you're not pulling in a lot of revenue
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:09.060]   That's purely based on the content that you've spent millions and millions of dollars
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:14.900]   If not built actually there's billions of dollars, uh, on us that's yeah, so you spend a lot of money
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:19.220]   That's a lot of investment to recoup and it's not something that you're necessarily pulling in a lot of subscription
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:22.500]   Money from on day one or even on day 365
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:27.860]   So I think this is a larger play from apple and this is still sort of the
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:33.780]   Planting their flag in the sand who say like hey, we've got this as an option
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:35.940]   Uh, this is you know
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:38.020]   This is a competition to amazon
[01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:42.900]   It's part of our whole package that we are sort of offering to people who use the apple ecosystem
[01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:45.380]   And you know, it's gonna be
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:51.220]   It's gonna be good stuff. I mean like I I think there's nothing so far that I've heard is absolute trash
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:54.740]   I know there's some stuff that has gotten worse reviews than others
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:58.900]   But I I think they've realized and to a certain extent in order to
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:05.780]   Exist as this mega tech company in this day and age that that original content for whatever reason is a part of that equation
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:08.980]   So I'm curious to see how they end up justifying
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:14.020]   Sort of like does it bring in people to buy other devices or subscribe to other services
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:18.980]   What is the end of the day value proposition for this or is it just something that we feel like?
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.780]   It's an investment in the longer term
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:26.020]   Ecosystem and it's kind of hard to figure out exactly how much money we're gonna make out of it
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:31.620]   Right because it's billions of dollars that they're spending on this content billions of dollars
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:38.740]   really, uh, this was available in Canada among many many other countries. That's one of the things that's
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:45.460]   Uh unique. I think in this launch is that apple built it for international and so it's not gonna
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:50.820]   We're gonna talk about what AT&T is doing with HBO max, which is a us only service essentially
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.620]   Um, but you got to see this stuff in Canada, right?
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:56:00.340]   Yeah, I mean there are services that have fairly good like netflix has built out fairly good international representation
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:05.540]   But because it is so like the licensing model is so fragmented and it's filled with these little different fifthums
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:10.180]   You don't have the same catalogs globally and it's incredibly frustrating. I'll go to watch some
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:14.740]   I I read I subscribe to cbs all access and i'll go to watch a show and i'll hit the button
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:18.820]   And it'll bounce me into one of my local cable apps because they have the rights in Canada
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:22.580]   And then they want me to put in a cable subscription, which I don't have and so I can't watch the thing
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:26.980]   That's part of the service that i'm already paying to watch and uh, it's endlessly frustrating
[01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:31.300]   But because this original is only apple owns all the rights to them and they can put them in hundreds of
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:35.060]   You know hundred plus countries right away, and I think that's great
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:37.860]   I think in general if apple decided they had to do it
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:40.420]   This was probably the best way for them to do it
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:43.780]   It's a very apple way to do it. It's like if we have these billions of dollars
[01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:45.780]   We want to help tell great stories
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:49.300]   Let's go out and let's just tell the best stories like we don't make
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:54.820]   Four phones a year the way one plus does we make like we have our our shot of phones all at one time
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:57:00.020]   They're just making a few series all at once and they're going to be top notch series
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:05.540]   I mean the morning show isn't the newsroom and see is not game of thrones by any means
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:07.060]   They started off
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:12.180]   With good ingredients that weren't stirred very well. They got better over the episodes and to dance point
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:16.180]   Like I would have just kept watching the morning show if all the episodes have been available
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:19.700]   And I would have just kept watching see if all the episodes had been there
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:26.020]   And I get why they're not because there's a free week trial and you could probably get through all of the content and then cancel immediately
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:31.620]   If you did that, but it's it's good enough and it's getting better with the opening salvo that i'm curious to see
[01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:33.940]   And I don't know if they necessarily have to make
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:41.860]   A lot of money here. I think they just have to get their platform going and then use it to again increase the value of the overall apple ecosystem for people
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:47.780]   Davenger, what do you think? I know you uh you care about tv and film. What do you think about what apple's doing here?
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:54.020]   I do and i've been following this closely and I was really excited to see like what would apple do differently and turns out
[01:57:54.020 --> 01:58:00.980]   Kind of kind of nothing like my my review title is apple tv plus is fine and it is like none of the shows are terrible
[01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:06.660]   Um, they're all perfectly watchable in certain ways, but yeah the morning, you know
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:14.980]   The morning hour feels like the newsroom and it feels a lot like erin sorkin without erin sorkin as I think the new york times review had said
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:20.340]   A lot of the all these shows in many ways feel like things we've seen before and it seems like
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:26.660]   At least right now apple is taking kind of the netflix approach to some of their content where it's like well, this is this is okay
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.380]   I guess i'll watch this because it's on a service
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:31.220]   um
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:34.580]   To what dan was saying. I think this is the opening salvo and I feel like
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:39.060]   Launching this thing in a hundred countries that's pretty impressive because uh disney plus
[01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:44.980]   Is only I think it'd be available in a couple once it launches in november or later this month. Yeah
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:50.820]   Um, so the scale of what apple did is impressive showing that they could produce this streaming platform
[01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:52.100]   I mean
[01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:56.180]   We knew they could deliver the stuff because of itunes and people have been buying that stuff for a while
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:59.940]   But showing that they could produce original content. Um, it's more like
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:04.020]   They prove that they can do it. I'm interested to see where they go from here
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:08.100]   Especially like that mnicham lunch show coming up soon
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:13.220]   Uh, they talked about some content coming into next year too. Nothing seems incredible
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:16.180]   Nothing seems like oh man. I really have to subscribe to this
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:22.260]   It does seem like oh, this is a nice benefit because i'm an apple customer because I just bought an iphone or an ipad or something
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:27.060]   I I don't think they're doing this for subscription money at all and that's why cost five dollars for sure
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:30.020]   Yeah, I wonder about it's tough to do it. I do
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:37.540]   I just want to say it's tough too because they've also not done the thing that a lot of the other competitors have done where it's like let's license
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:45.300]   Uh, you know large existing ip or own existing ip right disney gets to roll out all its marvel and star wars shows
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:47.380]   And that's a huge way to bring people in
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:52.820]   And you know nefflex obviously had its marvel shows back in the day and got to use that to sort of bolster
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:54.900]   It's original like early on
[01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:57.220]   I don't see apple
[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:01.460]   Deciding he wants to play in that pool certainly not from corporate partners that are that large
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:06.500]   Uh, it seems to be a very apple way of focusing on let let's kind of do this ourselves stem discern
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:09.620]   And I think that that presents potential challenges for them
[02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:12.820]   Um, and in terms of them building up their repertoire
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:16.020]   I think it's still possible that you know a show that comes out next year from them
[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:21.620]   Could pick up enough buzz to be the the show that drives people to the network right the water cooler show
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:23.940]   I think that's kind of what they're in search of is there
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:30.420]   Not as very game of thrones in genre, but game of thrones. I the show everyone is talking about when it goes on every week
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:32.180]   That is what they would like
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:35.140]   I just don't think they've necessarily figured out what show that is yet
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:37.700]   It does feel a little bit like these shows were created in a lab
[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:41.860]   Oh, yeah, they're trying to find that they're trying to strike gold
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:44.580]   And I get that but I I wonder
[02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:46.500]   um, if
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:52.500]   You're you're actually never going to do that if you're trying for the big hit what you need to do is find some people who are
[02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:56.180]   On the verge of superstardom as a writer as an actor
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:01:01.140]   And you have they have a great idea and it's going to bubble beneath the surface
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:04.500]   And they're not going to be a thousand stories in the hollywood reporter about it
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:11.060]   But it will be the thing that ends up breaking through just like with game of thrones other than people who had read those books
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:16.900]   Nobody knew anything about it and the showrunners had never done anything before and it became the biggest tv show ever
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:20.020]   These all feel like, you know, let's go to
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:24.420]   Reese witherspoon and jennifer aniston and craft something like the newsroom
[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:30.020]   Or let's spend a lot of money on a high concept thing kind of like game of thrones and it gives you see and we'll put jace
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:32.020]   Momoa in it and okay great
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:38.500]   But they they're coming out of the lab. Are they really going to be able to just look if you could make game of thrones in the lab
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:42.020]   There would be a hundred game of thrones and there's only one
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:46.740]   Um, although there are a lot of as much as i like that, you know, it is it is let's get run more
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:53.700]   To do a space show because we like battle star galactica and you know, it's it's a little bit different, but it's like that rene you were saying
[02:01:53.700 --> 02:02:02.580]   No, no, I was I was agreeing with you completely and I think also they managed to get the big stars by in some ways green lighting the vanity projects from their own production companies
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:04.740]   Instead of growing them inside
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:06.740]   Apple. I mean it's a good mix of both
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:10.580]   And that the risk is that not all these vanity projects where these big stars
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:15.780]   Are going to give you the quality of show that you get from a writer producer like erin sorcan or you get from
[02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:24.660]   Lighting fire to the entire world with no one's what apple hasn't done is make a giant deal with a creator like what you've seen elsewhere
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:27.620]   JJ abrams
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:34.500]   Several other creators that that johnna rimes ryan murphy right all of these where they're like you have established hits and now
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:36.660]   We're going to give you a lot of money and again the question is
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:43.540]   Are you going to get a new established hit from that or you know or would you be better off spending all that money on
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:47.540]   A bunch of people who are up and comers and apple
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:54.020]   I think maybe has just been out bid on those. I don't i'm not sure that's a strategy because they bid on a berm's famously
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:57.380]   I think there's a report that abrams turned them down even though their bid was higher
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:03.060]   Than you know other places where he went to so i'm really interested in like apple's creative approach to like what
[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:07.700]   What were they telling him in terms of like what stories you could tell or what restrictions right again and put on it?
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:10.420]   Yeah, and that was a huge their bid was double
[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:11.700]   um
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:12.500]   Yeah
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:17.300]   Warners that was he was a little worried about the film. He didn't he didn't want to be locked in
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:20.020]   They wanted him doing apple products
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:24.100]   Yeah, apple products only and he's he was like no. No, I want to do my own stuff too
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:28.980]   And I will say one of the big narratives coming into this launch was apple
[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:31.140]   You know, tim cook is giving notes
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:35.380]   Tim cook is saying you shouldn't really put things on in these shows that we can't show in an apple store
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:40.420]   The most cutting phrase that came up in the entire discussion was that what apple wanted to do was make
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:44.260]   uh, expensive nbc shows, which is a real burn
[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:46.500]   Let me tell you and I got to say
[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:53.060]   I think that um a lot of that came from people who got fired off of shows or were disgruntled in some way
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:57.780]   If you look at the material that's out there, there is no shortage of
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:00.980]   edgy material in the apple tv shows
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:03.540]   The three m drama's or tv ma
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:07.380]   No, it's not family friendly stuff entirely
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:11.780]   I would say five or ten years ago before all these before we had this
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:15.060]   Like surffit of content from all of these different services
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:18.900]   I think any one of these might have been a show that really caught people's attention
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:22.740]   But the problem is that these some of us the bar is so high. We're in the platinum
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:28.900]   A right the peak tv right there is so much stuff that making something stand out really requires it
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:34.500]   Be amazing and I think all of the shows sound like they are good solid shows
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:38.100]   And not every show has or couldn't be the greatest show of all time
[02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:45.380]   But I think that just because the competition is so fierce nowadays and people are dealing with essentially a lack of time
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:47.460]   Right, there's only so much tv you can watch
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:51.780]   Especially if you had need your time to read twitter or whatever that you're doing with the rest of your time
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:57.540]   That like it's you're fighting for your you're fighting for eyeballs a lot and I think that's that means you really got to bring your a game
[02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:02.580]   And I think this is you know, this is be game. It's not bad, but it's like it's not
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:06.340]   It's not necessarily the thing that's going to win people over to your service
[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:11.380]   Have you been watching more of the apple tv plus stuff? I read a review of the morning show
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:14.500]   Final episode which I haven't seen yet, but it should be out
[02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:16.980]   This week or next
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:22.020]   And they said it's the best last episode of any series in history. That wasn't the guardian what?
[02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:25.780]   All right, i'll give it a second chance
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:32.020]   But don't watch too much apple tv plus not when you've got a whole bunch of great twitch shows you could be watching
[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:38.340]   We had so much fun doing twit in 2019. I am so grateful to you for subscribing to our shows for
