[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this week in Tech. Episode 16 for July 31st, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:26.520]   Kevin Rose is missing in action once again, ladies and gentlemen. We think he's in San
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.000]   Diego, we're not sure. We saw him briefly on Skype and then as soon as we called him
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.520]   he hung up. I don't think he's more driving for an accident.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.920]   But Patrick Norton is with us, we're glad to say back from his. Were you in Palm Beach,
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.600]   wherever you were? I was in Key West Florida. You weren't Key West. Key West Florida does
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.840]   not suck. I've never been there before and I plan to go back again. So Patrick Norton
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.240]   is back but he's not home with us. He is in Las Vegas at DEF CON 13.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.520]   He's actually about a half mile away from DEF CON 13 because I won't log in anywhere
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.640]   near the network at DEF CON. He's on Skype at an undisclosed location where hackers can't
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.880]   get to. David Prager is with us in Los Angeles. From Irvine, California, we're so glad to
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.560]   have him back Steve Gibson of shieldsupgrc.com and of course the great spin right. Thank
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.920]   you everybody for being here. Oh, I forgot to mention John C. Devorak.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.920]   Devorak.org/blog. His blog? I like your blog, John. You put a lot of content out there.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.480]   I've got two other guys posting there and we try to keep it interesting with one or two
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.800]   themes. One of them government and competent, seen in some tech news and then weird stuff.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.480]   I enjoy it actually. I really enjoy reading it. Devorak.org/blog. Or just devorak.org.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.160]   It'll jump there anyway. It all gets to the same place. So I guess we should really start
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.440]   with an update on DEF CON because Patrick's been there. Have you been having fun? Yeah.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.760]   DEF CON is kind of like a weird sort of homecoming rolling. We can knowledge festival and party.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.440]   It's always highly amusing to see what people are up to and what has people spooked and
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.240]   what has people having fun. There's been all sorts of really cool stuff happening over
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.760]   the last couple of days. We think there's been a new record set for the longest distance
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.920]   reading in RFID tag. There's definitely a new distance for an amplified Wi-Fi network.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.720]   Actually 125 miles by a bunch of teenagers who basically they did the Wi-Fi shootout this
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.840]   year from they found basically a small mountain outside Las Vegas and these kids set up two
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.960]   giant satellite dishes and put one on this hill outside Las Vegas and the other one just
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.600]   outside of St. George, you do that. And they did a 125 mile connection off of a pair of 300
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.240]   milliwatt cards. What was the original record? They set the record last year somewhere around
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.520]   55.1 miles with some 30 milliwatt cards last year. Oh this is more than double.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.960]   Yeah. Well they use 300 milliwatt cards this year. A pair of 300 milliwatt cards.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.280]   I guess the story is about 11 o'clock on Saturday. They shot a distance of 125 miles.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.400]   Wow. They sent a Guinness record last year and they think this might qualify them for a new
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.240]   Guinness record. Is there any- Wait can you stop for a second? What was the, you tell me they did
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.960]   the 300 milliwatt? Yeah they did this with a pair of 300 milliwatt cards and they attached them to
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.160]   basically you remember the classic satellite television receiver dishes from the backyard
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.560]   the big 10 12 foot dishes. They used to go up with each of those as the antennas to do the shoe.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.920]   Okay. Are they passive though? They're not powered. They're not powered. They basically
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   use, it's my understanding they had a 300 milliwatt card at one end, a 300 milliwatt card at the other
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.480]   end and they were each connected to the antennas with no amplifiers. That's amazing. He's not like
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.080]   they were running three or four watt amplifiers at all. And of course his line is signed. Yeah.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.360]   You couldn't do that without a line of saying. And did they have people who both
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.200]   simultaneously? Obviously they're not driving back and forth. Well I haven't had a chance to talk to
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.320]   the guys but apparently they set up the antenna at one end that it was actually remote controlled
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.520]   so that they could make a couple of degrees or maybe more of adjustments in case it wasn't quite
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.200]   pointed in the right direction. Because what a lot of people have said is the biggest problem with
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.760]   doing these really long distance Wi-Fi records is actually being able to point the antennas at
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.800]   each other once you get out of, you know, you know, once you kind of start, you know, dealing with
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.760]   shooting over the horizon I think it gets a little troublesome to figure out where somebody is.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.400]   Yeah no kidding. I mean one tiny, you know, quarter inch adjustment and your miles off.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.840]   Wow. Well it sounds pretty amazing 125 miles with 300 milli watts. Yeah. Yeah they're, they use a
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.160]   team pad. It's the name of the group that did it and they were using a couple of VCOM 325 PCM CIA
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.440]   cards. What kind of data rate did they get though? I mean it must be very simple.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.280]   Well the computers we're running Linux, the link quality, this is a quote from Wi-Fi
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.960]   Toys.com which has a great article on it. So Wi-Fi-Toys.com and it said their link quality was so
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.440]   fantastic they got 12 millisecond ping times, ran shell commands, secure shell commands and
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:20.160]   even used VNC remote desktop. No that's amazing. Wow. Wow. Yeah Wi-Fi it's been interesting. Wi-Fi
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   has really been all over the conference. Jennifer Granik addressed and there was a, is part of her
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.680]   sort of ten top security questions or ten top legal questions talked about. Those were one of
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.640]   the things she talked about was whether or not it's legal to log on somebody's Wi-Fi router,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.560]   a protected Wi-Fi router, the war driving guys were talking about that today. And the general
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.920]   consensus is that unless you're in Florida it's okay. Yeah well what's interesting is that the
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.000]   thing that they said is except for in once you know basically the Florida case is one of the only
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.320]   cases where somebody's been logged into an unprotected Wi-Fi and was basically arrested for
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.800]   logging into an unprotected Wi-Fi or an unprotected WAP. In most of the cases when they say somebody's
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.240]   been arrested for war driving or somebody's been arrested for stealing Wi-Fi it was usually because
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.600]   they were caught doing something else at the same time. In one case a guy was basically
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.120]   sending out child pornography. Well that's, but that's the question I mean I can see why they'd
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.320]   want to prosecute him for that. Yeah but I mean like the, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.520]   the Wi-Fi violation was a small side step you know there's a small footnote to the actual
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.880]   activity that was taken. So if you log on and you get some email you, well what did she say? Did she
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.040]   say that it's the consensus is legal? Well the problem is the consensus is that if you, you know,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.320]   it was interesting us one of the reporters had seen it actually interviewed a prosecutor at the
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.840]   Department of Justice who did not want to be named but they basically said you know we can,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.200]   you know, this is one of those moments where you start thinking they before you explain like how
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.960]   they might prosecute somebody for this and it's kind of like just because you don't lock the
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.680]   front door of your house doesn't mean me walking in through the front door of your house is trespassing.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.040]   Right. It's still illegal to go in. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.160]   But going into somebody's house is not the same as having somebody drag you in the house.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.080]   When you're like sending out a Wi-Fi signal it's going out into the street. You're not going
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.320]   to be in the guy's house. Well yeah but then we get into the question of how bad are the tools
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.800]   should you be as you know should you be responsible and know how to use you know the SSID identifier
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.360]   signal that you're logging on to the right Wi-Fi station. That's true. I mean you could go by accident.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.200]   Dorit is there a sidewalk running from the house to the street John? Is that an invitation for me
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   to walk in your front door? Walking inside. No but what's the difference between just standing there
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:51.920]   and having somebody drop the house on you. This is not you know so I'm sitting here passively
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.160]   and I'm being inundated with your signal is really an imposition on me. They should sue the homeowner.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.800]   I mean you know they've got this thing backwards and I've been writing about this for a couple of years
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.880]   and they're going to have to do some case load because right now it's a confused myth and nobody
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.000]   really knows if you're going to get thrown in jail or not but as far as I'm going to be
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.440]   you're responsible for that signal. If you want to send it all over creation
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.120]   hey and somebody linked it to it that's not their fault necessarily. Your Wi-Fi got in my chocolate.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.200]   No your chocolate got in my Wi-Fi. Exactly. So but what it gets down to is there's no real case
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.040]   law for anybody to work with on this until you actually yeah not yet. What I've been advocating
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.600]   is that there have to be public policy once that's established and you know if you just tell people
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.440]   look if you're going to do this if you're going to you know you're the responsible person you've got
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.840]   the Wi-Fi router sitting here. If you don't want to put a simple password on it I'm not talking about
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   you know somebody out there trying to crack passwords we're talking about totally unprotected
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.640]   broadcast. As far as I'm concerned what about the person who wants to send the signal out for free.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.000]   I mean there's plenty of those in the Bay Area so how are you supposed to know?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.520]   I'm obviously you can tell what side I'm on. I agree with you John and I've been saying for a
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.760]   long time I took a lot of heat I was in the net stumbling forms over this a couple of years ago.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:15.120]   I was saying it's I was saying it's a diminumous use of a resource. What if as here's the example I
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.240]   gave if you leave your garbage can on the street and I'm walking by and I throw my piece of trash
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.080]   into your garbage can. I'm using your resource you're paying for the garbage but it's a
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.680]   diminumous use it's not going to be like I'm trespassing on your garbage can if you use if you
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.720]   borrow a sip of bandwidth from somebody to get your email how can you complain you've been damaged
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.920]   in any way by that. No they're paying a flat fee anyway it's not as though that you know because
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.560]   you showed up they have to pay more money. It's analogous to the garbage you know unless if I don't
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.600]   fill up your can if I throw a piece of a Coke can in there what's the big deal? Well the other thing
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.680]   is if you look at the terms of service for most broadband providers speak easy being a notable
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.400]   exception they will try to nail you to the floor if you're sharing your broadband connection. Oh really?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:06.000]   Well that's interesting. Yeah it's in the terms of service of most of most ISPs. Yeah but that's
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.480]   just a bluff. Who has ever been prosecuted or who's ever been shut down because of something like
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.760]   that. They don't want you to do it to put up a splash screen and start you know telling them
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.720]   the process. I think some of the some of the larger and so supposedly some of the larger
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.800]   vendors have gone after some people where they fought like you know five houses in the neighborhood
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.200]   where pulling one broadband connection. You could do that. Steve's been playing with OpenWRT which is
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.880]   the software that modifies your Linksys WRT router and one of the mods is setting up your very own
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.640]   your hotspot. Yep and you are able to crank up the output power so that it'll it'll reach further.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.200]   And of course there's all kinds of little antennas now you can add to these things to increase their
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.360]   range. Yeah you can get seven extra decibels with that new Linksys antenna and that's only just a
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.000]   little bitty add-on. You can buy the big antennas all those guys have them and I've been collecting
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.600]   them. I have to talk about collecting junk. I've got a bunch of these large antennas that are often
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   can be used and they have a pretty white pattern. They can push them. If you don't want them John I'll
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.160]   take them. I've been using them somehow. I was in um I was in the CNN San Francisco Bureau this week
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.560]   doing a thing for showbiz tonight and one of the news people were going you know you can use a
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.160]   Pringles can to steal Wi-Fi and apparently there's some high school in California that's banning
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:29.520]   Pringles can antennas like that somehow. You but coffee cans work much better. Yeah everybody says
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:36.240]   the coffee cans much better. Well what cracks me up is uh is that um first of all that these guys
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.200]   were talking about it and you know I mean we did this years ago but second of all that then in
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:48.160]   fact it is an issue apparently um uh some high school uh the high school student faces eight felony
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.400]   well let me see where it is. Cantana is illegal. Police arrested a high school student. They found
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:01.920]   a cantana in his room. Oh my god. What did they arrest him under under what law? According to the
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.960]   Sacramento Valley high tech crimes task force. Cantanas are illegal. Where where where's the link
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:17.840]   for this? This is yeah this is in tech dirt dot com uh I'll send you the link um a series of arrests
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.280]   of people for using open Wi-Fi networks which we've been talking about. Now this the issue is
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.160]   according to the Sacramento Valley high tech times task force these cantanas which they say are
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.960]   designed to steal Wi-Fi. What's the difference between that and a commercially sold antenna that
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:39.040]   you can plug into you know maybe those are illegal too. There's according to the quote high tech
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.760]   police officer they're unsophisticated but reliable and it's illegal to possess them.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.280]   This sounds like folklore. Um let me see if I can find the yeah. Well there's been a lot of cases
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.000]   there's been a lot of cases where stuff's been misreported by newspapers. This is from the Sacramento
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.320]   Bee. Yeah it's like it is. There's been a lot of bad reporting on it. I mean what is it
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.600]   technically it is illegal according to the FCC the whole point of having different you know pigtail
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.120]   connectors on different brands of Wi-Fi cards was to prevent people from mixing and matching
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.280]   antennas that common area antenna combinations had not been approved by the FCC.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.160]   You know and I don't really think the FCC is going to start you know hunting down everybody
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:29.680]   who's bought a you know a 24 DBI you know parabolic antenna and connected it to a Wi-Fi card but
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.960]   technically that is illegal if it hasn't been approved and tested by the vendor you know and
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:41.440]   FCC approved. They're quoting and I'll give you the guy's name since it's a Lieutenant Bob Lozito of
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.840]   the Sacramento Valley high tech crime unit. This is the quote from the Sacramento Bee which is a
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.600]   reliable newspaper. They're unsophisticated but reliable. He's talking about a Pringles can antenna
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.040]   and quote it's illegal to possess them. Now this is glued to credit. Whether that's true or not at
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.200]   least some police officers believe it. You got send me a link to that that goes right on there.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:08.320]   That's there's my column for uh for PCMEC. That's what we're here for John. Hey it's a great
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   one. Packers, packers, prey on unguarded wireless links. It just when I heard this you know I just
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.840]   thought my god I'm sending it to you right now John. It's just it's stunning and I guess it doesn't
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.680]   matter whether it's really illegal or not if the police believe it's illegal you could still get
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.560]   arrested for it right. What are they gonna throw you? I can just see the jail filling up with kids and
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.760]   you but coffee can. Well that's the thing the cantana doesn't work so anyway. You know there's
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:40.160]   actually a company called cantana and I think their website cantana.com and they make a commercial
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.040]   cantana. I mean it's a little more uh you know flicker than the than the than the cheapy.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.320]   Didn't we find Patrick that the Pringles can just didn't have enough metal in it. I mean really
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.840]   it's a cardboard too. I just thought that it was just it it falls apart. It crushes it's I mean the
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:01.360]   work but um the uh I actually uh you know like I said I like to use the coffee cans a lot better.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:09.200]   So you know you fell in you. You you band has a lot more caffeine too. And and you know Steve
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.280]   should know as one of the most hard quirk you and between you and Patrick you probably do half the
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:22.160]   output of Columbia. Yeah coffee beans. Between the two it were as it were. But you realize this is the
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.240]   this is the third week in a row that we keep coming back to and talking about the fact that it boils
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.960]   down to people using other people's bandwidth because they might be doing suspicious activity and they
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   don't know how they're going to trace it since it's someone else's since they're not paying for it.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.880]   Even in the article in the Sacramento Bee it keeps talking about people stealing credit card
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.520]   numbers from the Lowe's Hardware store. I mean hey are you still stealing your Wi-Fi today?
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.600]   I'm using it from across the street right now.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:52.720]   Works great. It does. That's why I'm not paying for it because I don't have to.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:16:00.080]   But if I didn't have any access then I'd pay for it. Uh you know I I guess this is just it's
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.840]   what you were saying John. I mean nobody's made any policy it's we're all just kind of making it
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.240]   up as we go along. And how many cities are there right now like the city of Hermosa Beach California
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.520]   provides free Wi-Fi access to anyone in range that gets the city that's paid for by the city?
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.400]   Right yeah I mean with Wi-Max you know the thing going on now with Wi-Max is just kind of curious
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.880]   because the cable companies and the phone companies are trying to get lost. Patrick
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.360]   Factor is a new one which I'll be bringing the blog into this. Actually maybe I'll throw this on the
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.640]   column. There's a new law that they're trying to pass which will ban the municipalities from
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:39.360]   doing what Hermosa Beach does by federal law. Well this is to me is a big issue because these
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.960]   federal law because I know states have been passing laws for a while now. Yeah let me see if I can
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.320]   find a reference while we're chatting here. Because that's really bugs the heck out of me. Uh uh and
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:56.160]   it's it's clearly because uh you know uh ISPs you know the big ISPs don't want um you know uh
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.840]   states to get in the business that they're trying to make some money at and of course the biggest uh
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.440]   the most ridiculous one was the the case in Pennsylvania. And that's called the Pennsylvania
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.040]   case law which was a they passed actually passed legislation because the city of Philadelphia I
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.600]   believe or Pittsburgh. Yeah it's Philadelphia yeah. They wanted to put up a big you know a day to
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.680]   11 system and then you know get gravitated to Wi-Max and make it as a civic thing so everybody in the
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.600]   city of Philadelphia would have broadband it would end the digital divide it would do this it would
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.720]   do that. Comcast and Verizon got together with the corrupt governor and then the next thing you know
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.000]   you end up with a uh some laws passed and they finally backed off on some of the some of the
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.480]   provisions in this law because the public got hold of this but now apparently this is going on
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.320]   on a federal level and I'm going to dig it up here because I'd love to know what Senator
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:51.600]   Congressmember is pushing this one. Uh some crook. Yeah there were I think it was 11 or 15 states
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.800]   that were I believe it was for Verizon. I said I should say that I assume it was Verizon
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.000]   was pushing similar law legislature to what they pushed through in Pennsylvania. I think this is
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.800]   risky because I think you start making these kinds of activities illegal you push this is
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.560]   the same problem I have with going after file sharing. You push a whole segment of the population
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:19.840]   that is considers itself law abiding into this realm of not being law abiding and at that point
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.960]   these these kids basically are going to say hey I'm already a crook I'm already a criminal and
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.600]   they're just going to go for it and you're going to have a whole generation of hackers who are so
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.000]   fed up with the corrupt government that they're completely outside the law and I don't I think
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.400]   that's very dangerous. Yeah well and it's also you know government is notoriously bad at legislating
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.760]   technology you know they'll right the law wrong. Absolutely I mean that's what's happened if
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:52.480]   Cantones are illegal somebody wrote the law. What else is going on at in Vegas right now Patrick?
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.840]   How did you went you did the spot the Fed did was that fun did you end up getting there in time?
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.120]   Well I've actually I I missed the spot that has gone on as they moved it to another location no
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.800]   no I wasn't your fault they moved it to another location but there's going to be another one
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:12.480]   right before the award ceremony today although I can say that I did meet a couple of members of
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.920]   three letter agencies while I was there. I just this is one where where you know you as as a
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.480]   attendee of Defcon say I think that guy's a fed and then they do this if the fed or
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.440]   supposed fed goes along with it they do a 20 questions and I'm just surprised that nobody has
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.560]   yet spotted Patrick as a fed don't you don't you think that surprises me yeah he doesn't he
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.360]   looked like he's a cop like undercover well he looks like a lousy undercover but
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.560]   like a secret service guy you know he needs to be talking to himself. You've never seen me.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.760]   You need a little earbud and a lapel mic Patrick you get busted right away.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:56.640]   You have a lot of fun. Yeah what I need is one of those little flip down you know fanny packs
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.160]   you wear around the front that hides the gun in the spare ammunition glitch.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:08.400]   Do you think a lot of people at Defcon pack heat? I don't think anybody at Defcon well I take
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.720]   that back and I'm pretty sure a few people at Defcon pack heat but I'm pretty sure they also pack
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.640]   heat when they go into the 7-11. How many people at Defcon pack lock pick kits? I have a picture of
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.680]   three people demonstrating their lock pick kits. There was a huge series of tracks on this year
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.840]   on lock picking and even a session on safe cracking. That's become a really serious hobby for a lot
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.200]   of people. Oh my god there's some of the some of the. Hey we need a safe cracker we've got a
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.800]   safe that to be honest about it. If anybody's out there that can do this we have a safe in our
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.840]   we have this duplex and Berkeley and we put a safe in it and then this we've looked it up and
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.200]   the safe mechanism failed and to be open sometimes we don't want to just die. I actually
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   it's your stash in there John. I'm looking for a safe cracker I'm curious. I mean anyone wants to
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.880]   just send me a name. No no John. A guy I went to a guy I went to college with his family ran a
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:09.360]   business that sold safes in Manhattan from 1888 till I think 1995 or something. He could do it. So he
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.000]   probably knows somebody. Yeah if he can't do it he probably knows somebody you can. Can't most
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.480]   aren't most locksmiths kind of trained in that or is that such an esoteric field now that it's
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.520]   locksmith wouldn't help. I think safes are a little esoteric. Yeah well if you can't pick it I know a
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.080]   guy who's really good at making thermite. That's the problem. There's something that we don't want
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:35.440]   to damage. I'm telling you it's something from the 60s he's been saving. Yeah right. It's actually a
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:45.920]   gemstone. Oh a valuable gem. Well you've just raised the price of the safe cracker John.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.280]   That's not that valuable. That's what it keeps saying. It would survive the explosion though right?
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.000]   I don't think so. It's an opal. Oh yeah that opal will get burned right up sure.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.360]   Hey so was this guy Michael Lynn who was the former Cisco employee? Was that a
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.440]   defcon or was that a black hat when he was presenting it? Well he was black. He first of all he's
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.320]   not a former Cisco employee. He was he's not a former ISS employee. Right. So I'm calling
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:19.440]   a security security research firm. And he uh actually Jennifer Granik actually kind of brokered
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.960]   his deal because he was about to be sued by ISS and Cisco. She brokered his deal with them.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:32.800]   And then he uh in the words of a friend of mine who's at the uh who's uh was bad at both black hat
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.280]   and defcon. He's pretty sure he's hiding somewhere looking for a rock to hide other firm. Let me
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   give you the who what when where why on this this ISS Michael Lynn is an ISS employee security
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:49.840]   expert who was going to give a presentation at black hat on how to use these well known flaws in
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.400]   Cisco's routers to hack them. Cisco sued and Cisco and ISS agreed to pull the presentation.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:02.880]   If that Cisco hired some interns to to rip pages out of the black hat conference bulletins and to
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.440]   re-burn all the CDs then Michael Lynn quits ISS as I'm delivering it anyway and delivers it
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:15.840]   at which point he actually he didn't get to. He started doing sort of an alternate
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.560]   presentation and about 10 minutes into it just went for it and started doing his original
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.240]   presentation. Oh so he quit he quit by default at which point everybody sues everybody else
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.480]   and then but there was a deal brokered as you said so nobody's gonna you know be sued or what
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.800]   what happened what's the upshot of it. Well he's he had the he uh there's there's a couple
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.280]   articles online that are probably going to be a little more accurate than I am right now but
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.680]   essentially he had to turn over all of his source code all of his research and pretty much agreed
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.480]   and never do any research on Cisco routers again in the future. And yet this is a well-known
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:55.440]   hole isn't it Steve I mean this this well no it it was completely quiet and no one knew about it
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:02.000]   and it was it was this it was it was Lynn who decided it was really really dangerous to keep
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.360]   it the secret because this is a huge potentially a huge problem he felt for the internet. This is
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:14.080]   in the uh in the Cisco internet work operating system. Yeah I mean it it it potentially allows
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.440]   them the it's the so-called shell code sort of the holding grail would be to be able to take over
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:26.480]   a Cisco router remotely and and get root on the router and you know recall kinds of havoc on the
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:33.280]   internet. Now Cisco has a patch for this yes. Yes there there are there are patches available
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.640]   and it turns out that when you look at it more closely it's it would be hard to use this thing
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:46.240]   to do much damage because you're not able it involves using using a malformed IP version 6 packet
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.840]   which basically crashes the router like any buffer overflow does or if it's if you're really
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:59.200]   good it allows you to get some privileges but the packet itself is so messed up that one router
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.240]   won't pass it to another so you're not able to target a distant router you're only able to deal
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.840]   with the one that you're directly connected to. So you need a physical connection to it?
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.880]   You need a physical connection now in in theory if you did this correctly you could you could
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:18.960]   design something so that you you take over the one you're connected to and that router then takes
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   over the ones it's connected to to create sort of a propagating attack but that's purely theoretical
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.600]   at this point. And so Michael Ruhsung has gone into hiding then he's done?
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   And apparently the FBI has started up something too I heard just recently that they're doing an
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.840]   investigation. Yeah what's what's interesting to do one of the things that there is somebody does
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:50.160]   backbone testing and who did that's a pretty long seminar yesterday and she actually said she
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.720]   is not that concerned about it but the general advice is if you're running the Cisco you know
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.840]   routers to update them patch them and patch them now all right but that the patch has been
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:07.520]   available since April so. The problem is with routers discussion. With routers people are slow
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.520]   to patch and even more slow than they are to patch their operating system it's a yeah it's kind of
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:17.280]   this is a good time to not be slow with that because it's a lot of people were tired a lot of people
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:22.160]   were a lot of people were upset with what Lynn did I think partially because they have to protect
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.560]   you know large and diverse systems and a lot of people were you know a lot of people were pretty
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.640]   impressed you know there's a lot of people were like wow that was amazing I wouldn't have done it
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.440]   because you know I wouldn't have done it but but a lot of people were pretty impressed and he
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.120]   decided to to get the information out there. At the same time his career as a security researcher
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.920]   is probably over now. Well there's some interesting debates back and forth because there's a couple
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:54.880]   of the security research firms I have and this is completely unverified rumor but there there is
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.120]   some speculation that a couple of firms have offered him jobs. Security research firms are
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:05.680]   notorious not notoriously finicky about who they hire are they I mean they don't really care if
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.160]   a guy's good they're gonna hire him in fact they get a lot of points you know hiring people like that
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.760]   has anybody installed I was gonna do this and I didn't get around to it before we broadcast
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.920]   today that the 2.0 patch for PSP because I've heard some amazing things about this I don't know
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.360]   in a PSP why do they know I was the one here own a PSP I do yeah and I was hoping Yoshi would be on
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.840]   this one because I'm sure Yoshi's done it already. But the John was probably one I've done it a
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.880]   pile somewhere. Yeah Johnny have one in that pile. Actually Tony got me off some time ago. Oh really?
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.400]   Did you say something bad? I don't know I think it's just that you know these lot of these people
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.800]   they switch around their agencies a lot and Sony is one of the worst for that and then you get
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.680]   taken off a list and you can't get back on it because you don't know who to talk to. I've had
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.840]   bad results with Sony I called them before I was doing I mean I was doing a Regis and Kelly and I
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:57.760]   wanted to show I remember they have that wireless TV the location free right and they and I said I
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.720]   want to show it on Regis and Kelly I said no we don't have and we're not nevermind. Wow I said what?
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:09.520]   Yeah that's totally Sony Sony is one of the probably one of the poorest companies when it comes to
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.960]   a techie oriented PR they believe in fact you know when they first rolled out the
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.320]   VIO the initial one years and years ago that there was a desktop machine they actually made
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.640]   the comment that we're not interested in you know we're at PC magazine we wanted to review it and
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.880]   they said we're not interested we don't want that type of people interested in our computer we
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.240]   want the public apparently Regis and Kelly they don't want them either so I don't know what I guess
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.920]   who do they want well they probably think that you're just like a nerd your
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.320]   pure nerdy groove right and they don't need you yeah the housewives don't watch what I'm on well
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.080]   frankly those early VIOs were not very impressive so if that's why exactly they didn't want techie's
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.680]   to see him exactly but they spent a lot of money on the booth when they uh when they introduced them
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.400]   it was purple zodiac out of business tap wave I'm kind of sad about this I really liked this
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.280]   zodiac it was a palm but it was also game oriented I thought it was very cool a lot of good reviews
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:09.520]   uh I guess nobody bought it so to speak I never heard of it you remember the tap wave it with
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.960]   the zodiac it was a sideways palm it was a little gaming device but it was also you don't remember
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.400]   that huh no it had also been a nice little media machine yeah did you could you you could play
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.000]   videos on it couldn't you yeah absolutely yeah oh wow
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.920]   how different is it from like some of the uh arcos uh well it's a palm that's the main thing is you
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.160]   would be buying a palm device and playing a premium for a somewhat larger screen and game
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:42.640]   pad style controls on this thing we gave it great reviews on tech tv I know a lot of people
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.960]   loved it uh it was around for a couple of years right it was around for a couple of years they
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:53.440]   made little cartridge you know st card games for it uh it did photos as well as and videos as well
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.800]   and then but uh I guess you know it's not a good business to be in right now it's a
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.200]   tough you know what I find really interesting is that we're already seeing people producing
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:08.800]   movies on both DVD and PSP discs yes I mean it's happened immediately yeah like wow but aren't
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.560]   they all Sony movies I think Sony also had a lot of has a lot of influence the movie industry and
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.160]   so they influenced a lot of that to get it onto their universal media disc their their um d's right
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.040]   which I don't know what the capacity is of those it's smaller than DVD which means I would think
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.560]   that the compression has to be a little maybe yeah but it's such a small screen you don't care
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.000]   I mean yes certainly you wouldn't want to hook it up to a tv and watch it off of that but it looks
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.320]   fine on a small screen. Pickle vision yeah exactly anything else anybody wants to talk about
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.440]   should we talk about this google microsoft beta one yeah did you get it you would look at it
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.160]   weren't you the new copy of it? I spent a couple days with it what do you think it's going to be
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.640]   really interesting it's what's also interesting is like I got to spend some time with a couple
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:01.280]   people who are related to people on the windows long horn and IE7 development teams
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:09.120]   apparently it's they're running in seven different directions at microsoft and they've been changing
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:15.680]   the the focus of the the long horn team constantly yeah in the last two years well I remember
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   talking to somebody about the file system and they had already written a good portion of it and
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.840]   decided to start all over again last year I mean it just must be very demoralizing for them.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:32.480]   It sounds like it's interesting the windows vista outside of the the nifty you know field of grass
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:38.720]   when you open it up you know it's got the it's got the glass interface if you've got a 3d card
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.440]   that'll support it which is the transparency on the window it's the arrow interface look or stop
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.400]   it's the arrow interface look or style which is kind of clean they're doing some interesting
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.640]   stuff they're finally doing a lot of security to prevent uh base would prevent spyware for
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.720]   being able to write stuff anywhere it wants to in the operating system a side effect to that and
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.360]   the beta one that I was using was you can no longer you know store files directly on the c drive
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:07.840]   well that means of course they'll take it out before they ship it well yeah well they they may not
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.160]   because they're part of what they're doing with the with the search is being integrated into everything
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.400]   and and they're using virtual folders so the idea is that they're gonna I think they're gonna try to
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.520]   lock down the location to where you can where you can actually place your content in an effort to
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.200]   try to you know give it a more unix like uh you know file folder yeah but the miniature the minute
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.720]   make it more robust the minute all of these uh ISVs the software vendors see this and say but
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.800]   wait a minute my program relies on writing to the c drive they're gonna they're gonna say oh yeah
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.120]   you're right I guess we better not do that okay I found that uh the the bill we were talking about
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.760]   earlier what's that oh yeah the federal federal bill to yeah it's called the broadband investment
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.400]   and consumer choice act I like the way they were at least they do it every time and it was then
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:56.880]   introduced by senator antin and co-sponsored by our friend uh john mccain really yeah and
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.560]   if and i'll just read there's a couple of websites i'll put it on my blog later today or tomorrow morning
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.200]   yeah well uh well which I guess we'll be running about the same time and I did number nine which is
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.760]   the one of the elements of this thing is pre-empt local governments from building competing
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.600]   networks the act basically adopts a Pennsylvania plan if the local or state government wants to
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.760]   build a network it must issue a request for proposal to see if any private company wants to
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:26.400]   build a network instead you know only if no only if no private provider offers to build a
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.240]   comparable network in the state or local government build and operate the network any system in
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.800]   existence at the time of the act is grandfather but only if it does not expand anyway this is
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:42.320]   goes on and on there's a couple other things uh it takes away uh whatever whatever regulation
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.440]   there is eliminates any state or local control of quality of service or prices and of course all
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.920]   of that is to improve consumer choice yeah there's a consumer choice thing yeah eliminates any
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.120]   build out requirements or anti redlining provision uh eliminates good private right of action
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.160]   against the video or telephone providers your only recourse is the fcc complaint process
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.920]   it limits fcc authority to regulate anything but 911 eliminates any requirement or for phone or
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.200]   cable companies to resell capacity no more of the uh you know it can't buy any lines
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.040]   eliminates the need to open up competing long for long distance guys it's just basically a
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.680]   throw it's a it's just one of these you know omnibus builds that design to screw the consumer
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.440]   and of course it'll get through because nobody will pay any attention to it because it's too
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:30.640]   complicated and uh it'll just go right through it could well why don't we tell everybody who's
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.360]   listening good thinking is right there congress critter all 12 of them are gonna
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:41.280]   get what they are in european or lio posted on the twit website and we can that'll do it well
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.640]   we'll do it with a few 200 000 people listen that's good that's a start yeah tell your friends
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:53.920]   you know we're gonna get this going here i'm sitting here fuming it's unbelievable they keep
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.680]   doing this stuff i mean it's one thing after another but you know it's like like who's interest
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.920]   i mean these some of these people that are in congress need to really you know that if you're
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:08.880]   running for uh the house of representatives if you're in the amount of times you get reelected
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:16.160]   is run at a 96 to 98 percent rate which means the only time you can even get into the house if you
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.400]   want to run is you have to find somebody's retiring and then you have to do it's an open
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.000]   race but if once you're in you might as well just you know you can just throw your feet up and do
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.720]   whatever you want and i i just just baffles me that the public puts up with this it's the old
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.840]   adage that everybody hates everybody else's congressman but their own you know they keep
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.000]   reelecting our guys great but everybody else is terrible well the thing that's happened over
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.880]   the last few years is what at least what i've been seeing is where you have special interests
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.040]   not really working within their own congressional boundaries for example you'd have
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:53.280]   like the senator from utah representing the liquor industry uh to make sure that you can't ship
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.720]   cross state lines and things like that which benefits a couple of the big distributors
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.800]   uh you and you have people out in the middle of nowhere or west virginia representing hollywood
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.960]   interests because you know they it's like their local constituency doesn't really care it's like
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.760]   you know if this guy wants to represent hollywood no one you know there's nobody to vote against
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.120]   that because it doesn't seem to have any uh impact on the local economy right it's just
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.520]   weird to me the way the whole thing is structured sorry
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.600]   uh does that count as politics or can we say all that
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:29.280]   no i'm actually not i think it that's all tech that's all dead senator i mean some of the most
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.520]   ridiculous laws that have been passed i mean they're just so self-serving i'm just going to keep my
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.520]   mouth shut so it's all ranted so hp is pulling out of the so hp is pulling out of the ipod business
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.800]   why did they ever get into the ipod it is it how
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:50.160]   why are they pulling out do we know that well are they said it wasn't the quote a huge deal
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:55.600]   for hp in other words they i'd sound like they didn't sell very many of them they
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.160]   at most ipods are still apple branded ipods h proly it was the same price wasn't it yeah
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.960]   well whatever the hp i'd want the apple i think the idea from apple's point of view was they got
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:10.720]   a more better distribution and maybe some windows users would be more reassured by buying it from hp
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.560]   but everybody knows a mac product according to the uh stories about hp sold about eight percent
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.920]   of all ipods in the june quarter so it wasn't that's probably yeah i'm surprised it was that
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.320]   high yeah i am too i thought you know maybe that so sam san was in town uh this last week and
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:35.280]   they had they were showcasing all their new uh electronic gizmos from the camera and and the mp3
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.440]   player division and they've got some uh they're they're getting pretty aggressive with the mp3
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.520]   players have to say i like sam i've always liked sam san has accompanied i think they do good stuff
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:50.080]   um the ipods obviously not going to be dominant forever who's gonna who's gonna break the ipod
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:56.640]   monopoly when and how it's gonna happen somebody that knows how to make a really cool looking product
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.520]   you think it's looks i think a lot of it's looks and you know apple has always been credited with
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:08.640]   having and i was faced with having a lunch with the ceo of frog design a couple years ago and he
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.440]   was mentioning to me that uh apple is known in the design industry as having the absolute best
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:21.280]   industrial design team in the world jonathan ises who's the guy who did the odd brilliant guy
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:26.240]   and it's not just the look though i mean i think they also have the easiest to use interface
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.280]   i think i've been i've recently spent a bunch of time playing around with some other hard drive
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:38.240]   players and uh boy there's some incredibly awkward interfaces out there no kidding i mean just
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   impressively painful to use and what's really amazing is some of them you know they're still
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.720]   not actually catching the contents of the drive so there's a lag time as it sort of figures and
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.600]   and the more songs you have the longer that lag time is you know every time you launch the the
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.520]   player i thought it was a more price sensitive market than it really turned out to be i remember
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.680]   when the mini came out i think by patrick you agreed with me we thought it was just
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.760]   too expensive for too little storage and that nobody would buy it i'm boy were we wrong
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.400]   um what you guys seen you can spend you can save money you i mean look del you can get a del gj
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.520]   20 gigabyte dj now for 162 bucks half yeah no which which one were you talking about a second
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.080]   i know the ipod mini remember when it came out oh yeah was hugely expensive
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:28.000]   have you guys seen this new moby blue gigabyte cube digital audio player that's sold at walmart
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.560]   no yeah that's a hoot i think it looks kind of cool it's a hundred twenty nine dollars for
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:39.040]   twenty five millimeters on a side oh with the look one inch yeah one inch by one inch by one inch
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:47.120]   moby the singer or moby m-o-b-i m-o-b-i moby blue moby blue blu uh it's got a o-l-e-d display it's
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:54.320]   got to you know fm tuner the usb 2.0 place 10 hours according to the website it's cute looking
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.840]   how much does how big is 20 you said 20 gigs no no no no no no no no one gig it's a solid state
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.880]   solid state one gig for one to world they of course they want to take on the shuffle
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.360]   i think i said man you got a display you can actually see what you're doing yeah but you don't
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.080]   want to sit on it it's got points on the corners yeah yeah i don't know i mean i don't know how
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.680]   usable that display is going to be because i've used some of the moby blue players
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:21.360]   they're not well a couple people have seen them better a display than no display i think well
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:27.520]   i don't know i'd be honest with you i've used i've i've tested like nine different flash based mp3
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.040]   players in the last two years and i got to be honest with you a lot of the displays on them
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.760]   are useless and the menu is you know if when you get up to a gigabyte and you've got 300 songs
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.080]   some of them don't even do foldering which means you actually have to skip forward to the song
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.640]   you want so is it going to be that somebody's got somebody's going to do a better ui is that how
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:49.520]   you're going to beat the ipod how do you beat the ipod i think the apple is a status symbol right i
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:55.600]   mean it is among kids it's like hey i you do you have an ipod or one of those clones i talked to a
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.000]   symbols die over time well like yeah some someday something's going to come along
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.440]   i talked to a designer said this the best thing this guy was a brand expert the smartest thing apple
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.440]   did was make the headphones white and his thinking was you don't know what mp3 players somebody's
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.960]   carrying you can't see it there in a pocket but you always know if they've got an ipod because
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:20.080]   they've got the white headphones and that was the best thing apple did for branding interesting i
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:26.160]   can't i can't stand those earbuds any earbuds ever since i started using these atomotic earphones i
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.600]   i hate everything else but you look like a dork if you wear big you know cans over your ears oh no
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.920]   no these those little adam well the one i don't know why i use the atom i love the i think they stick
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.200]   them in you can stick them in your ear i don't know if they're the most fantastic but although
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.280]   they're very good no they're very stock stuff they're fantastic of course they also cost about
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.520]   half the price of the ipod patrick's been patrick been trying to get me to do that for years i
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.440]   finally went and i and now i'm a hook i can't use anything else well you know one of the problems
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.520]   with those old-fashioned earbuds is that they project the sound straight into the ear and they're
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:01.120]   dangerous on that one you're hearing what well you know earbuds there's dangerous technology
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:08.480]   i'm deaf i'm so deaf anyway why do i uh i'm so deaf hey are we worried about the uh foam coming
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.760]   off the shuttle uh uh or what what's the deal on that i the gosh i hate to be one of the astronauts
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.280]   and hear that oh yes something else fell off i think i think everybody just demoralized
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.680]   in that now because they were all you know after all this delay they were finally thing
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.880]   thing okay we got this all figured out and you know apparently they know that they're gonna have
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.760]   i mean it's part of the design lots of little pieces are going to come off they just know that
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:39.680]   but it's and and of course those pose no risk at all to the piles on the shuttle but it's when
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:46.400]   these one pound chunks come off that it is a really a problem well i think the problem is that they
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.440]   they've always had stuff falling off they spent a lot of time and money trying to reduce the amount
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.480]   of stuff falling off and then they also spent a lot of time and money trying to be able to analyze
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.520]   stuff that falls off so as a result they see everything that happens and they still have to
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:06.560]   deal with a problem that stuff has always fallen off and now we have cameras that they're showing
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.040]   everybody stuff that we wouldn't even know about before well i like the backflip i thought that
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:16.000]   that was kind of neat yeah i mean they they got some great analysis and now of course they're
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.040]   they're actually considering using one of their space blocks or adding another one to look at uh
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.440]   i think near the nose cone of the uh of the shuttle because they have some some bits of material sticking
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:34.960]   up from the front that of course is a result of them being able to do over analysis well i'm always
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.560]   surprised there's two things that have surprised me about this one is that how can this is all
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:45.120]   happening now this thing has been flying around for what 15 years i don't know longer 1981 1981 it's
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:51.280]   okay it's been almost 25 years yeah it's been up and now this problem is like sudden i mean
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.600]   what was things falling off before where they usually are they losing using lousy glue i mean
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:01.280]   what's changed i mean what's changed between then and now and the other thing is it seems to me that
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.840]   they should have always been doing an inspection of the shuttle when it's in space that you know
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.520]   like any pilot does with his with his craft when you get a chance to inspect it you inspect it
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.880]   to just to see what the hell you know going on with the thing before you have to take it back
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.760]   and land it apparently one of the problems is that the shuttle's been around for so long as you
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:26.000]   say 25 years and hopefully it's going to last us another five is that many of the technicians who
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.920]   who developed the craft have retired and so we don't have the trained personnel anymore who like
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.240]   you know knew the nuances of how to get the foam on and and keep it on yeah that's probably true
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.560]   that happens with all technology that you linger right if we can get another five years out of it
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:52.320]   i think they're trying to get 19 or 20 more missions out of our existing um you know uh fleet such as
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.240]   it is diminishing fleet then everyone's going to be happy
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:04.240]   well it depends on whether or not they're going to fly something else and then before the end of
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.720]   the year now they're even wondering about because they keep having to go back to their proverbial
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:16.320]   drawing board they want to face it out by the sorry the depressing news do we have to do
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:23.120]   i'm trying to find something upbeat trying to find a happy spot getting arrested for can
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.560]   can uh the technologies are falling apart i thought something very cool at the very end
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:34.480]   and meet the press this morning tim russer announced their podcast yeah everybody's doing podcasts
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:41.200]   yeah and now we're falling down the charts you know we used to be number two oh oh oh wait wait
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.280]   wait don't get that don't get so worried about that because i finally found out today
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:52.160]   from somebody how and maybe somebody from apple tell us if this isn't true but the the story is that
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:58.400]   the iPod ratings are based on new subscribers in the last 24 hours ah that would make sense not a
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.320]   total number of subscribers that would actually make sense because it seems very volatile and by
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.720]   the way something weird happened this week and i was you know we were number two and i was watching
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:12.880]   this porn podcast the violet blue porn podcast we're watching you're listening to you know i was
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:18.080]   watching it only i was only watching the charts i was watching it climb up towards us and then all
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.800]   of it and i thought boy i wonder how apple feels about the fact that the number four podcast on its
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:29.520]   list is a porn podcast what's a porn podcast it's uh well it's uh it's a it's a erotic every year
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:35.360]   of phone sex it's uh it's i haven't listened to it it's by somebody named violet blue and uh i don't
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.160]   know what it is it's some talk sexier i don't think so i think she does interviews some of those
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.880]   old dirty joke albums and then podcast you know what those would probably do very well yeah old
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:51.120]   maybe the old uh red fox and rusty roads or whatever name was it's it's uh well here's the thing i
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.600]   thought maybe i was ready to start a conspiracy theory because as it climbed and climbed and i thought
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:02.960]   wonder how long apple is gonna and all of a sudden it falls precipitously it tumbles down and it's now
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:10.160]   number 45 so uh i'm wondering uh what's the story morning glory there was a little bit of
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.400]   intervention on apple that's what i think now currently we're number four ebert and roper
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:20.720]   number two skip to calathy which actually is a good podcast uh from bat pig studios is and i'm in
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   an independent podcast i'm so i'm glad to see that they're number three ebert and roper are ahead of
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.920]   us they're number two oh please what what is their podcast is it an audio version of the show or
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:34.080]   do they do some as a supplement they do reviews they're 20 minutes long i think it's the whole show
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:39.440]   they do uh they do reviews i don't listen to it i want to listen to a movie review i think two thumbs
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.600]   up for stealth uh but i happen to like ebert and roper i like them too well you know what i like
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.360]   about them you go to the last five minutes they run down their thoughts and your eyes all you need
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.040]   maybe that's why it's such a popular effect that's all they should do is just podcast the last five
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:58.240]   minutes it'd be a lot easier i liked it better when they when siskel used to always get fights with
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:04.320]   with ebert gagreek i'm learning some more about the itunes music store as well patrick i found out
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:10.400]   from a very reliable source that itunes music store caches the podcasts now there was some
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:16.160]   speculation about that before but apparently the top 200 podcasts are being served not from our
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:23.920]   server but from apple's own servers which means our stats are completely off oh that's annoying it
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.640]   means we have no idea how many people are listening well it's annoying on that respect although we
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.720]   still have such high stats that i know we have it just means we have more listeners than we thought
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.560]   i can't wait till google releases their google podcast that's going to make a big difference i
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.480]   think in a way it's good though because what it means is you can be a success on the itunes music
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.880]   store and not have to worry about being banned with you know slaughter yeah which what it was
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.960]   probably a good thing yeah does that give somebody time what google's up to with their podcast thing
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.560]   does anybody know i just made that up i i just assumed that they were gonna get
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:57.280]   David's third of ours what that they might do something you know our podcast search engine or
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.600]   something like that there's gotta be i was sure hot scope videos going nuts have you seen pod
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:07.200]   scope dot com p o d s c o p dot com they search our podcast and a number of others and they do what
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:15.600]   they do it's interesting they do i scope pod scope dot com they do a um uh oh it was not a c r voice
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.240]   recognition they actually listen to the podcast and turn it and uh and are able to index the words in
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.960]   the podcast it's dictionary based so you know don't do a search for twit or uh you know a port but if
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:33.760]   you did a search for uh you know uh a dictionary word you know a search for you can't do cantana but
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.520]   you could do you could probably do antenna or or wifi uh and it what's interesting is you can play
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:46.400]   segments of the podcast with that portion so it's actually very i think a very efficiently put in
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.320]   wifi looks and listen we couldn't find any hits uh maybe that's not an
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.960]   dictionary let me try yeah you would need to do techie terms yeah better or it's gonna
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:00.080]   type in i typed in windows vista both words in the dictionary and it says we looked and
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:05.120]   listened but we couldn't find any hits well okay so this sucks in other words well it's gonna be a
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:11.280]   really hard thing to do too i mean you know the whole the whole speech recognition against a dictionary
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.560]   deal i mean with all of us talking at the same time on top of each other and on most podcasts
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:22.400]   are terrible you'd probably get enough words though to make it of some value yeah you know i i don't
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.440]   i think it's a start you're right it's a difficult challenge but i i like the idea i think it's
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:34.240]   going to take a look at how to make it work speaking of google i uh just for you john i google
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:40.560]   violet blue the uh podcast that was the naughty podcast that was rising so high it's uh open source
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.840]   sex ronika sex edmoor with sex edmoor with open pilot blue it's open source open source open source
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:54.400]   sex epiphany doors no now john was the joke that had to be made
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.640]   it's a open source sex 15 beginning with a little bit about sex podcasting i also talk about being
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.040]   interviewed by newsweek the wall street journal a funny news week anecdote then i read the
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:08.800]   as previously promised antiques roadshow smut by author don se davidson so she's reading erudite
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:13.280]   reading iraq discerning ears see is it but but but but let me just point out
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:18.960]   newsweek and wall street journal interviewed her why because she was number four on the podcast
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:24.400]   on the i-tunes podcast interview you or no they didn't well leo's not you know i'm not
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.040]   he i'm the name of violet you are but not in that way i think it's just i think it's the wall street
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.840]   journal saying who is this beating us because we're number six who is this beating us i've got to
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:38.720]   find out how the podcast yeah the wall they have a tech podcast they do yeah wall street journal
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.760]   tech news it's it's short i don't know have you listened really no i don't know hey you know why
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.640]   we need to listen to these guys we got our own we know more than they do do we i think so
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:55.600]   probably i just want the pot scope and typed in bush and i got you know looking for george bush
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   obviously yes and in fact there's a bunch of stuff or you get a ask for information about
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.960]   supreme court nominee mostly yep and you could probably uh i believe you could play
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.640]   sections of the podcast from there
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.840]   that i i don't you know it's it's brand new who knows who they are or how
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.840]   but you know how well they'll do but i it's a i like it because it's an it's an attempt
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:21.280]   and did you say the wall street journal has a tech podcast yeah it's number six on the i-tunes
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:27.840]   i i found on something called podcast 411 on their 64th show will do an interview with Walt
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.400]   mossburg and katie i don't know katie billet from the wall street journal but that's someone else
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.240]   that's somebody interviewing them why would they want to get interviewed about tech stuff when
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:41.040]   they've got their own tech well now that's publicity so we'll never we'll never get walt on this show
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:47.680]   i'm afraid um i like mossburg i like him too but i just don't think he'll ever do our show
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.120]   well we could ask him moss moss mossburg if you're listening i personally like to
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:59.520]   i have access i have access to the twit treasury mr mossburg i'd like to offer you 25
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:04.880]   dollars in cash to be on this part i don't think you can take it i think he's got he's
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:10.000]   he's required by the the uh ethics of the wall street journal have to take anything worth more
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.560]   than a t-shirt we'll do it under the counter i'll tell you what i will i will i will make a
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:20.880]   no i will make a twit t-shirt for walt mossburg so it will be on the twit cash all right walt
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:26.960]   but gauntlet is thrown we've got to check waiting for you no no i'm sorry a bag of quarters
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:34.720]   waiting one thousand quarters waiting for you i hope that's right i didn't offer
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:39.120]   them much of money then did i thousand thousand thousand quarters isn't that 25 bucks
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.160]   no no that's that's that's that's that's that's a lot of money i'm no walled i'm sorry i take it back
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:50.240]   you can't take that money anyway it's impossible you decide that you know he makes four hundred
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.160]   fifty thousand dollars a year does he really well actually we think it's maybe more than that now
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.720]   he's beep well you know because he was going to quit at one time and they had nobody over there
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:03.920]   is he now i'm asking the wrong guy john but is he the most powerful tech journalist out there
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.640]   i don't think there is a powerful tech journalist to be honest about it and i don't think he's
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:13.600]   that you know he's not the one mark off not the one nobody is there's no powerful
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:20.240]   tech journalist because nobody gives a crap about gilmore gilmore is a blogger yeah he doesn't even
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:25.520]   have a he doesn't even have a platform talking about tech is not used to mostly about complaining
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.440]   about the bush administration yeah you know we're talking about blogging i mean most of the
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:35.520]   guys who've gone into blogging have big are still kind of targeting blogging more i mean they talk
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.880]   more about blogging as though they're all right because of a cult well it's like podcasts that's
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.440]   all podcast talk about what we're doing oh yeah that's right never mind let me it wasn't there
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.360]   wasn't there was it that used to do that list of the most uh influential tech journalists uh it used
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.520]   to be uh marketing computers and it became technology marketing but it it lost it you know it does
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.920]   it's a meaningless list it's put together by pr people and the people on that list i have to say
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:03.840]   it's because the pr people like them right i never made a list well not always john was always on
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:09.120]   you were always on it for a while and then they took me off and uh you know i got bumped off
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.000]   to think eventually it was my dream and now you know well you could have been on it because they
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.840]   had broadcasting section they had people on there they had their names misspelled they're not even
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.520]   doing broadcasting at one time they moved Fred Davis up to the uh out of the blue they moving him
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:28.720]   onto the list of the influential for something he never even did who married he never did it he
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:33.760]   was over it got people broke by the time it lived i mean it was a miserable list it wasn't very
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:39.040]   well done it's pretty funny yeah it's it and that's the i guess really i make that point because
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:44.720]   all of these lists are silly top podcasts you know all of this stuff is silly well you know having
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:50.560]   been in it we would like you if you have a chance to vote for no no yeah for us you know i i've been
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.480]   in a lot of these meetings where these things are decided and it's a bunch of guys sitting around
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.320]   drinking coffee and you know saying what do you think i don't know he's a jerk but i don't want to
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:04.000]   put him on but he's pretty influential and it's brilliant let's put on soul and so the lists are
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.440]   basically made up in the in the edit room and they're not the reflection of just a few people it's
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:15.120]   almost a joke yeah what about this at black hat this a demonstration that they did uh maybe you
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.720]   saw it Patrick where the guy showed that he could receive an RFID or read an RFID tag from you know
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:25.360]   what was it 50 feet away a hundred feet away yeah i was actually telling you about that they
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:31.920]   they did it they can only do it 50 feet at black hats uh because uh they only do 50 feet of black
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.120]   hat because that was how big the room was so they could go far they're huge antenna i'm sorry they
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:43.680]   could go farther they did a little over 69 feet at uh Def Con and actually i know both of the guys
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.520]   who are doing the research and i'm trying to remember the name of their company uh is his name Kevin
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:54.640]   Mahaffey i have it on my blog let's go look it up well and the issue is that the us for instance
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:59.040]   is going to require RFID's or start putting RFID's in its passports soon you're gonna see RFID
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:04.560]   everywhere if if your identification card has an RFID and somebody can read it from a hundred feet
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:12.800]   away uh what kind of privacy implications does that have yes Kevin Mahaffey well it's uh yeah but
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:19.120]   it's a kind of fine his company it's calm wait are you talking about flexilis flexilis.com that's the
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:27.600]   one so um you know all you need to do is you you go down to an art supply store someplace that has
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.880]   you don't even need thick stuff but you just need a piece of lead foil and you take your lead
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.680]   foil and you just cut it out to be about the size of a dollar bill and you put it in your wallet
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.440]   and they're all the carts inside between the two pieces of the foil when the when the when the
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:46.000]   wall is folded in half and there's no nothing's coming out of there i got a foil jacket i'm
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.280]   gonna wear foil jacket would work also you know the bag film bags that you could put you stuff in
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:56.000]   there oh yeah well that in fact when you get the uh here in the bay area you know they have the
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.560]   tol tags and when you get the tol tag it comes in a special bag that insulates it and they say if
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:07.520]   you don't want us to collect the toll when you drive through the across the bridge put your RFID
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:12.960]   tag in a bag in this bag keep this bag with you and it's just a little it looks like my lard just a
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:18.560]   little plastic bag it could be yeah it doesn't take much i usually i do know that i've kept that tag
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:23.120]   you're talking about in my glove box and it nailed it from there oh really yeah right from the guy
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:27.760]   here beep going off in the glove box but i noticed when i don't want to you know use it because
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.840]   sometimes when it's getting near the end you don't want to over you know run it out if you sit on it
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:41.600]   that's because you gotta let that out that's what they called Walter Cronkite old iron butt because
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:48.080]   he could just sit in the chair and anchor the newscast for hours and hours and hours that's what the
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:53.040]   space shuttle needs we need another Walter Cronkite he did more for the u.s. space program than any
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:57.760]   any ten astronauts together by the way any back to the RFID I miss Walter Cronkite I do so
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.640]   experiment with some different substances like see you know even aluminum foil may
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:07.280]   prevent the things from getting tagged it's just it's radio so your metal would theoretically be
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:14.800]   uh be able to shield it yeah hey guys we've used up our our allotted time i thank you all for being
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:19.760]   here we don't have time for questions but it's great uh i don't Kevin Rose where are you where

[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.840]   yeah safe crackers please email john davorax.org
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:08.160]   steve gibson's at grc.com everything going well for you steve when are you going to release this new
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:16.080]   leak test program i'm going to start working on it shortly i've got we're going to do some
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:22.400]   another upgrade round to shields up i've come up with a way of making essentially allowing
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:29.680]   shields up to figure out how many packets it can send even on a guy's firewall connection so that
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.400]   it will be self-pacing will be able to do much faster and much more comprehensive scan and it'll
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:40.640]   bust through the firewall essentially yeah wow should people uh forget software firewalls are
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.880]   that is it just useless you know every layer of security that you can add without inconveniencing
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:54.640]   yourself i think is a good thing but you know i'm just so pro nat router as a hardware firewall
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.680]   right that i think that makes a lot of sense that's the way to go. David Prager how are things
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:05.440]   going at system i know you got a new issue out uh yeah we put we wanted to put something out you
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.320]   know really right now everyone's getting up to san francisco getting an office and once that
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.720]   happens it's really going to get going but uh why did it definitely put something out i'm real i'm
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.360]   i'm a big fan of actually of uh david randoff who is the broadcast engineer that helped us out
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.840]   and doing something that that uh i guess a lot of people had some interest in some people didn't but
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.400]   it's it's a it was a it was a cool guide to uh audio and video cables and home theater
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:36.480]   system three but uh yeah but there will be a lot a lot more coming out very very soon systm.org
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.800]   correct or revision three dot com is that going to be the new say everything's going to go to
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.720]   revision three dot revision three is the production company and then there's like there's the
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   dignity show there's the broken which by the way is being worked on and there's a lot of people
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.160]   understand that oh there is going to be another broken oh yes oh yeah oh good and there's actually

[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.600]   trying to find a place that is equidistant between uh everybody in san francisco me up here in uh
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:26.800]   sonoma county and devoreca in the east bay and i think we've got a spot that is actually as close
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:33.120]   to physically at the intersections of those three lines as you can get uh should be equidistant and
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.840]   it's either larkspur or fair facts guys so um we'll let you know as soon as we uh we find the
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:44.240]   location uh two really good candidates and both of them have beer on tap and uh and uh and uh

[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.720]   standards hey yeah i was gonna say never let it be said john is it live in the dream baby
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:45.840]   yeah he's crap is that why you got into this business john to get free crap you know i never
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.400]   thought about it i'll admit that's why i got into reviewing software i just want free software
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.560]   it's fun but you know i mean it just feels you feel good i well when i was really in a
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.480]   four-world column it was the same sort of deal you know i mean just this stuff just came every day
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:04.000]   and it was kind of neat yeah well it's actually a burden uh not that i'm complaining about it but
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.840]   it's fact is you get a lot of stuff you don't have time to look for and you feel guilty about
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.160]   right i can't and to refuse most things to be honest about it it's only when i'm targeting
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.680]   something i need to see it i'll call a vendor up and tell me need to i agree with you it becomes
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:20.560]   a burden you've i've seen john's gas station uh have do you still have that above the gas station
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:27.920]   uh no that's long gone but that was a typical example he had a room big one too what must have been
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:35.360]   couple of thousand square feet over a gas station jammed with crap the people had sent him yeah
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:41.040]   in fact the first the first time i ever went to your house john you had a pile in the living room
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.560]   yeah well you know whatever house i have there's a pile in the living room this weekend tech
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.200]   tech the shortest distance from the mailbox to the office the living room most of the pile
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.480]   not to kind of but you know we got wasted right now we're at the end taking first job
