[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.520]   Because with every purchase Visa prevents, detects,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.460]   and resolves online fraud.

[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.020]   This is Twit.
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, episode 154 in which we gather together
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.220]   and discuss the latest news from the world of technology.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.300]   And of course, there's always a great panel assembled to do that.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.120]   We had so much fun last week with Kevin Rose and
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.320]   Patrick Norton, the old guard on the show, John C. Devorak.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320]   He's back.

[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.120]   Hey, John, how are you?
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.200]   I got some complaints about last week's show.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.360]   Oh, yeah, because we picked on Kevin.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.480]   No, no, because it was said to be boring or it went off topic.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480]   I can't win.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.480]   Or it's too busy.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480]   I can't win.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.480]   It's too busy.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.640]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.160]   It's too busy.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   We talked a little bit about this.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.640]   New word, by the way.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640]   Business-y?
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.200]   It was too busy.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.240]   I got that from a couple of people.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480]   Other people say it was just, you know, it wasn't interesting.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480]   I don't know.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.480]   I thought it was fun.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.480]   I liked it.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   I had fun.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480]   I liked it too.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.480]   I thought it was great if people don't like it.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.480]   I'll tell you what happens with Twit.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   We just put together a different panel every week trying to mix it up.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.960]   You're one of the few consistent parts of it.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.040]   And then it's different because of that.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.880]   It's a different character every time.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.200]   Last week, I knew it would be a lot of, you know, inside baseball because it's old buddies
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   talking together.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.720]   But people were asking for that.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.160]   They said, "Oh, Twit's gotten too newsy.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.440]   We want more camaraderie."
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.000]   So that was the camaraderie episode.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.960]   We'll do this will be the news episode.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.680]   I do think though that, and Scoble blogged this, that a lot of tech guys have focused
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.600]   more and more on business and less and less on kind of enthusiast topics.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.360]   Yeah, he's one of the guys who said this kind of like, "Baseball."
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   Businesses or...
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   Nice motion.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   What, Sagan?
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.760]   Oh, I didn't introduce you yet.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.120]   You can't talk until you're introduced.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.720]   He's not allowed to talk.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.920]   You ain't new neither.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   Oh, sorry.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   Whoops.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.800]   Also, here Will Harris from Channel Flip.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.560]   He's at ChannelFlip.com, Mr. Harris.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.160]   It is indeed wonderful, but only...
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.960]   The wonderful.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.640]   The spectacular.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.720]   And that voice, my friends, is Don Risinger.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.520]   Late addition to the panel.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.200]   I heard Don, we called him like two minutes ago, said, "Can you be on Twitter?"
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   That's right.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   Hey, thanks for having me, Leo.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   It just means you're not doing nothing.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   It's a Saturday afternoon.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   It's a Saturday night.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   It's a Saturday night here.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   You think I'd be out.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   You know, I'm a young guy.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.960]   You think I'd be out, you know, at a bar or whatever.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   Oh, no.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   Hold on a second.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   Saturday night, what time is it?
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   Six, fifteen.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   Six, fifteen.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.600]   So you're at dinner time.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.680]   What are you like living in Florida and you're 70 years old?
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   I wish I was.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.600]   He's been to the early bird special at Denny's.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   He's fed his...
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.240]   Had his fill of mashed potatoes and oatmeal.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.240]   And now he's ready to podcast.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.840]   I'm ready to do it.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   According...
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.480]   I've got a bottle of wine at the paraplegama, so I'm right here and ready.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.280]   In your new apartment.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.320]   I'm sorry, flat.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   Very exciting.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.240]   Are you still in Oxford?
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   Well we moved just outside of Oxford.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   Okay.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   So just out of the sense.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240]   Oh, there's the end.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   It's the beginning.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.240]   He's got to the suburbs.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   Next stop, baby ville.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   Do you have to go through a department of Homeland Security to get to baby ville?
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.160]   Because if you do, don't bring your laptop.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.680]   Man, what a story that was.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.000]   What is that all about?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.120]   Federal agents may take a traveler's laptop or other electronic device to an off-site
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.600]   location for an unspecified period of time without...
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.680]   And this is the part that is so unconstitutional without any suspicion of wrongdoing.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.560]   This is from the US Department of Homeland Security.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.640]   They may also share copies of the laptop's contents with other agencies and private entities
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.520]   for language translation, data decryption or other reasons.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.040]   These policies dated July 16th were issued by the US Customs and Border Protection Agency
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.800]   and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.440]   Isn't it illegal to...
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.560]   This is the part that bugs me.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:15.560]   This is without any cause, without just cause to seize and inspect a laptop?
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.800]   Or is there something about crossing the border that you have to you aggregate your rights?
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.040]   I think it's all about crazy fundamentalist politicians that are doing this crap and they
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.760]   don't really care and they're making all these crazy laws and they're trying to make it...
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.160]   I think it is illegal but they don't care.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.640]   That's something that we don't have to care about anymore.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.560]   Yeah, let me try...
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.440]   Let me chime in here.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.880]   Until we actually get somebody to call in or let us know...
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.200]   They throw these things out there as I think as a cover-your-ass situation for the one
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   time they may confiscate somebody's laptop.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.520]   But until I see laptops actually being confiscated or iPods actually being confiscated like they
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.680]   will do if you're bringing some good salami from France I might add.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.680]   Until I actually see that...
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.600]   That's because they don't pasteurize their salami in France.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.320]   Until I actually hear stories or I have somebody complaining, although I have heard this in
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.000]   the past and they used to always have the ability to detain you and go over the laptop
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.560]   because they were doing their...
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.320]   Commonly the Americans and the Canadians go back and forth on this kind of thing.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.800]   Until I actually hear some stories...
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   You're saying they're not doing it.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.040]   Here's what Michael Churdoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, wrote in USA Today.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.400]   He said, "The most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers."
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.720]   I'm sorry, I can't even say it with his straight face.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   He should know.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.880]   Do you know who we need for the definitive answer?
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   Where is Blogger Bob when you need it?
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.240]   Blogger Bob of the TSA.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.800]   Why should Michael Churdoff know?
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.680]   I'm just kidding.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.880]   But if you look at him, he's kind of creepy.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.400]   Now he does point out, he does point out, and this is true, and somebody in the chat
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.880]   was saying this, "Look, they can go through your bags without...
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.880]   Everybody's bags.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.840]   They don't have any need to have any level of suspicion."
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.640]   He says, "This isn't going to happen until you get to a secondary check," which means
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.760]   there was something we suspect you for some reason.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.000]   Whether that's just cause or probable cause is another matter.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.520]   I imagine the test for probable cause is much lower in cases like this, right?
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.600]   Because you're trying to end up in a country.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   Yes, you walk across the border going, "That to America.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.120]   That to America."
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.040]   And you, the next thing you know, you're in a secondary screen.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   Tattoo America.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.200]   What are you talking about tattooing it?
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   That's a tattoo America.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.440]   That's a tattoo America.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.440]   So you say that to these guys?
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.240]   I think I'm going to look at your laptop.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   I mean, come on.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.640]   It depends on whether they define contraband as drugs and weapons or MP3s and ripped DVDs.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   Does that mean?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.640]   Well, ripped DVDs.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   That's the fear.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:03.080]   That's the fear, it seems to me, that most of this complaining has come about.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:09.600]   Stem... is based upon is the fear that, "Oh God, I've got a couple of MP3s that I illegally
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.080]   copied and they're going to take my laptop and they're going to...
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   This is nonsense.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080]   It's not going to happen.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.720]   I think it's fair to say that if you're a foreigner coming into America, you pretty
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.920]   much expect to get screwed over anyway.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   They take your thumbprint.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   They take your...
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920]   They question you.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.320]   Do they take you to the print?
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.480]   What I find really...
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.000]   I mean, I don't want to get into the...
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.640]   What's the process of coming into the country?
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.760]   I'm not a tall African American.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.920]   But as a business person or a leisure traveler from the UK, you're allowed to come and stay
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.720]   for like 60 days in America with no visa for any kind of business purposes, any kind of
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   leisure travel.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.360]   The only type of business you can't come into America with no visa for is journalism.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   You've got to go through a really, really elaborate process to get an American visa if
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.520]   you're a journalist because they sure as hell want to know every journalist that's coming
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   into this country.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.160]   Is that because journalists are often crypto fascists and terrorists or...
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.880]   I know I just love that.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880]   I think they just...
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.440]   I don't know.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.960]   But it's just the case that as a journalist, you've got to go through a lot of extra hoops
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.760]   as opposed to any other type of business.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.360]   Do they fingerprint you when you come in the country?
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.960]   Fingerprint, photos, passport, scan, everything.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.120]   Well, let's go over the...
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.040]   Let's go over the process, Will.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.960]   You're coming into the country.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.200]   Let's say you're on the...
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:39.800]   You're on the probably the British Overseas Airlines Corporation BOAC Comet coming in landing
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.040]   at JFK.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.000]   Much of all, as you got, Blogger Bob says, "Hey, don't sound American."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.120]   So number one, you've got the little forms on the plane to fill out.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.880]   We've got the back of the film like, "Are you a terrorist?
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.520]   Have you ever been affiliated with a terrorist group?
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   Have you been convicted of...
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.520]   Oh, yes I am.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.400]   Have you ever been in any illegal work since the country?"
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   And it's like, "No, you're not."
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   I am a terrorist.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.480]   Who answers yes to that?
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.320]   What kind of nutball...
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320]   That must be the nutball screening.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   You've got a screening.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   That's not the terrorist screening.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   You've got a right thing.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   Where it is just staying.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.880]   So how long you're staying and what hotel or what residence you're staying at the time
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   you're there.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.680]   You've then got to go into the visa clearance hall, which is like a line that takes about
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.960]   two hours to clear.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.000]   You're not allowed to use your cell phone in the entry hall because that's a security
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   risk.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.780]   I saw a guard pull a gun on a guy who was talking on his cell phone in the security
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.240]   hall, which I thought was crazy.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.360]   You've then got to give your visa.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.240]   If you're a journalist, it's got to be valid.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   You've got to have a photo taken.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.600]   Both your thumbs scanned.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.440]   You've got to give a plausible reason for being in the country to the person, give the
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.240]   date of your exit, and then assuming you can do all that, then you can go on your waist.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.000]   The process from getting off the plane to getting through, pretty takes about two hours,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   two and a half hours.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well, that's because you're a foreigner.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.320]   Well, I think you left something out.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.040]   What about that whole money laundering career you used to have before your journals?
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.480]   I think that might be a tip off in this paper.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   No, I've heard a lot of people.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.760]   I have a genuine problem.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.400]   I do actually have a genuine problem.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.560]   There must be some terrorist called Willem Hazira or something somewhere because I cannot
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.680]   get on a plane without having a passport check.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.160]   I can't use those auto-checking things online.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.000]   I can't use the self-check kiosks.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.280]   They also, you've got a problem.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.160]   Every time I go to check in, someone has to mysteriously go make a phone call to check
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.000]   my passport every single time.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I did your own list.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Yeah, I asked them once I got to go.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Adam Curry is on this.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I went...
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Adam, check in.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I have to have this.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   She was like, "Yeah, you're on the list."
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.800]   I looked at this on this list.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.680]   Adam, how did Adam go on the list?
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.720]   Adam gets it's at least two hour thing.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.640]   He comes in, we talk about this on the No Agenda show.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.480]   Not a lot, but every time he comes into the country, we go over it again.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.840]   They all know him, which is really weird.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.320]   "Oh, yeah, Adam.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.400]   Yeah, well, you're on the list, so we got to put you through this and that."
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.600]   So he finally found some guy that would tell him there's apparently a guy with the same
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   name, Adam Curry, who is out of North Dakota.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:14.040]   They found that much out, who is some sort of a guy, a person of interest that they would
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:21.640]   like to grab, I suppose, and just for the process, just because it's a bureaucratic joke,
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.560]   they have to make him go through this whole process of questions and answers and what
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.120]   he'd do in here and all the rest of it.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.880]   I wanted to ask, "Are you coming in as a journalist?
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.640]   You're saying, 'I'm a journalist.'"
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.840]   Well, it's not that I come in and shout, "I'm a journalist."
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.800]   But if they ask you, "What are you doing here?"
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.080]   and you're reporting on something and you say, "I'm just here for leisure purposes."
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.800]   If they later find out that you're reporting on something like you file a story and they
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.400]   happen to notice it, then you can just be chucked out summarily.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.560]   How are they going to happen to notice it?
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.520]   I don't know.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.720]   I don't like to take the chance.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.800]   If it's Guantanamo-Ezer, then frankly, I'm going to go get the user.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.520]   The thing is, when you go to China, they always advise you, whatever you do, you put down
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   manager.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   Oh, really?
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   Never ever.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   You're a journalist going to China.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.000]   You never take that as a journalist, even if you are.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.080]   If you're doing whatever it is, the thing that they want to see is under that line,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.200]   and it's just the way it works in some of these bureaucracies.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.520]   When you get a visa for China, your job is manager.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   Good.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.360]   How about business man?
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.520]   No, no.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   Manager.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520]   Salary man.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   I'm just telling you.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   Manage.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.040]   You take it or leave it.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   No, I'll take it.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   I'll be a manager from now.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   I'm a manager.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   I manage.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   You're totally a manager.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.040]   I am a manager.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.040]   We're all managers.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.680]   The very liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the US in April said, "The government does
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.640]   in fact have the power to conduct searches of an international traveler's laptop without
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.240]   suspicion of wrongdoing."
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.400]   So you don't have a protection.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   US citizens are not.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.240]   If you're crossing the border, they have the right to inspect without suspicion.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.480]   I will let you know how it goes in a week or so.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.480]   You're coming.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.920]   I feel so crazy about this because these pro privacy initiatives, some of them are getting
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.920]   out of hand.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.400]   I was talking to this week in the digital home about the Google Street view and this guy
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.320]   says, "I'm going to sue Google for $30,000 or whatever it is because it's devouring my
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.200]   property and you put pictures of me and all this stuff."
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   Oh, please.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   It's a fan.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   It's getting turned.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.960]   It's driving down a public street with a camera in it.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   Exactly.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   And you can see it walking right down the street.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.520]   But then I look at this and I say, "Well, maybe those people need to focus their attention
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.520]   on this sort of thing.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.680]   I mean, this is crazy.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.320]   It never ends and not to mention, you know, we're being inundated with these issues.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   I agree with Will.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.360]   I mean, I have to drive to Canada and have to face all these issues with customs.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   Now, it's enough is enough.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   Enough is enough."
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   Well, okay.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.040]   I'm going to play the devil's advocate on rising here because, I mean, somebody has to.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.400]   If you're, you know, it's the same thing on driving down the street.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.800]   You don't have the same privileges.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   Driving's a privilege.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.080]   Crossing into the US is a privilege.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.040]   It is not a right.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.120]   And so you don't have the same protections as you would just, you know, standing there.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:19.240]   So as a US citizen, the police don't have the right to search you without probable cause.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   They just can't.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   It's illegal.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   Unconstitutional.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.880]   It's for the amendment.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.960]   But it's a different thing.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.840]   You kind of abrogate some rights when you say, I'm going to cross the border or I'm going
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.840]   to drive a car.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.480]   I mean, they're actually still like a problem.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.400]   Very, very insular way of looking at things.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.960]   It's like you're fine as long as you never ever leave America.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.480]   If you don't do nothing wrong, what do you got to worry about?
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   What is it?
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.440]   You know, in what if you got to hide rising up?
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   What have you got to hide?
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440]   Oh, I got a lot.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   So I don't worry about that.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   I'm not going to say it here.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440]   I'll go to jail.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   Like he said, but no, there is a minute.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   Hold on there.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.040]   Boy, what you talking about?
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.880]   What do you got?
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.120]   Slow down, cowboy.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   Slow down, cowboy.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   What are you on?
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   Non risinger.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.360]   Oh, only cow.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.920]   That was quite an admission, Don.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920]   You sure you want to leave that?
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.760]   Shall I add that up?
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.760]   Please do.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   Never know.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.760]   I'll lose every job I ever had.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.240]   Oh, he's a drunk.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   We all know that.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   It's okay.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.240]   I'll just be on the list.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.040]   So let me, you know, this is by the way, just so we don't make it sound like we're the
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.760]   only country with these crazy things going on.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:29.800]   Let me read, I happen to have the passenger customs declaration that you use when you're
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.040]   going into Korea.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.080]   And they also do the same thing where they ask you a bunch of questions to see how, I
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.480]   think it's just the stupid questions.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.520]   How dumb are you?
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.760]   So it goes like this.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.920]   Customs declaration by traveler.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.600]   Are you bringing into Korea?
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   One.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.200]   Firearms, knives, crossbows or other weapons.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   Crossbows.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.160]   Bullets, poisonous radioactive substance and monitoring facility.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.760]   Do you have a trebuche in your packet and your bill, just nunchucks.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.240]   That's all I have.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   Suppose.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   Yes or no.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   No, wait a minute.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   That's number one.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.580]   Number two, illicit drugs such as opium, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cannabis
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.480]   or any medicine such as diet pills that may be prohibited or subject to restrictions by
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.480]   law.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.480]   Yes or no.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.160]   Prednisone, is that okay?
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.800]   Don't think so.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   Maybe crack.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.760]   It goes on with these kinds of things like a good down to number seven.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.520]   Are you bringing in counterfeit currency?
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.240]   Yes or no?
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.240]   Eight.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   Eight.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   Are you bringing in pornographic materials?
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.240]   Yes.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   CDs, photos.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.240]   Hold on a minute.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.480]   Why is it so bad?
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.200]   Why can't I bring in a copy of hustle?
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   What's the big deal with that?
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   No, no, you can't.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   It's a different kind of country.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   No, no, no, you can't do that.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.200]   You leave it at that time.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   No hustler on you.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.680]   Would you want to, what were you traveling with a copy of a hustler for something?
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.960]   I often wonder, you know, they have the airport magazines stores and they sell stuff
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   like that there.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.560]   And I wonder, are you going to read that on the plane?
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.520]   Like you're going to sit next to somebody and you're going to go, "Whoa!"
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.520]   On the plane.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.520]   You're going to go in the men's room?
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   The men's room.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.520]   You're going to do.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.520]   That's right.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.520]   I can't.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.440]   Why would you buy a girly magazine in the airport and then read it in the plane?
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.240]   I mean, I mean, I sometimes I'm watching movies on my computer and I go, "Whoa!"
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.240]   Because there's like a little nudity or something and I'm a normal movie and I'm thinking, "Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:37.880]   Because there's like a little nudity or something and I'm a normal movie and I'm thinking, "Whoa!"
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   And you sign your name.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   So there you go.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.920]   So really, maybe what this is all about is then now if you've purged yourself.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.200]   And so if they do catch you with that stuff, now they've got you on record.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.360]   In writing with a signature saying, "I don't have it."
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   So they got you extra.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   Oh, it's bull.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.440]   Well, have you guys seen this show?
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.600]   It's like locked up overseas or something like that?
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   I think it's on the National Geographic.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   You probably don't have it in the UK.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   I'm sure that.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   You've seen it.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   Oh, you have seen it.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   It's unbelievable.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.600]   These guys, I mean, they get locked up in there and these crazy...
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.640]   I was watching one where the prisoners were running the prison and the guards were, you
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   know, they're just totally scared.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.080]   I'm thinking of myself, "Now that's a place I don't want to be."
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.560]   So maybe I would, you know, be honest if I was bringing, I don't know, cocaine to Korea
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   or something.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.160]   You're bringing any of these things.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.640]   Anyway, you should go...
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   By the way, you should travel light.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   I tell everyone to do this.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.800]   But cocaine doesn't weigh much.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   You're counterfeit money.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   You still waste.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   Leave the nunchucks.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.040]   The crossbows at home.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.520]   Just, you know, buy stuff overseas and bring it back there or ship it back.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.960]   So curiosity, are crossbows still in widespread use and circulation?
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   Apparently in Korea.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.600]   You know what?
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.760]   I'm going to tell you one thing you don't want to do at the airport and that's get
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.360]   any apps on the iPhone store.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.440]   Because you will crash it.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.520]   You will crash your iPhone that you get on the airplane.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.520]   I love the apps.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   Is this now a...
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.320]   Is this now a established fact that if you update an iPhone app over the air, you're
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   going to break it?
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   I'm the only one who's saying it.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.080]   It's my assertion that the iPhone, all of the unreliability I'd had with the iPhone and
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.120]   I've had to restore it to a hard restore three times, four times.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.720]   All of it has gone away when I stopped downloading applications on the iPhone and only download
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.040]   them on iTunes and sync.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.040]   Same thing with updates.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.800]   And it's my contention that there is...
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:26.040]   And by the way, I have to say that I mentioned this to Nicholas Jikkoff who is the guy who
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.360]   wrote Quicksilver for the Mac and he works on Google.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   He all...
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   Yeah, we were talking about on Mac break a week.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   He wrote the...
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.280]   Or co-wrote the Google iPhone app.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.560]   So he's an iPhone developer.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.120]   He said, "I think it's true too."
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.640]   It's I think a partial download that if you get a broken download, it will just smash your
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.400]   iPhone and you're stuck.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.160]   But anyway, it's purely empirical.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.600]   It's circumstantial evidence.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.480]   But I have to say in three days, no problems at all.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   None.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   And I've got 40 ads.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.440]   I've been pretty lucky with my iPhone 3G.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.520]   My old iPhone, he crashed all the time.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520]   I had to restore it.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.520]   I think like five, six times.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.680]   This one, not one problem yet.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.120]   And I have actually downloaded some, not through iTunes.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.480]   I've done it right on the iPhone.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   I've had pretty good luck.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   So I'm surprised.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.240]   Maybe I'm just in the minority, but I don't know.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.920]   But here's my thinking is that most of the time these downloads are fine.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.960]   So a lot of people I have said, "Oh, Leo, that's not true.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.320]   I downloaded a lot of time."
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   Most of the time they're fine.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.520]   The thing is that's the thing that once in a while goes wrong and can really screw you
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520]   up.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.720]   So it's fine unless you get a bad download or a part...
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.200]   I think what it is, is partial downloads.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   So I probably should stop then.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   I would recommend it.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.200]   Yeah, I would recommend it.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   Yeah, I'd be trying to get the net-chat iPhone app yet.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   Now that's an interesting story.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.440]   All right, let's talk about this.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440]   This is from Noel River.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.200]   They do some great iPhone apps.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   For about five minutes, you could buy this application on the app store that allows
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.920]   you to use your iPhone as a tethered modem or untethered modem.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.400]   So you could use the 3G network to surf on your laptop.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.840]   It was there briefly and Apple immediately pulled it.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.840]   Why?
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   And it's back again.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   Is it back?
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   Back again.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   Well, the question is...
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.320]   Yeah, I'm going to download it immediately.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   It's 10 bucks.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.680]   Well, the thinking is first of all, here's the question.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   First of all, how do they...
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.520]   By the way, there's an app on the Nokia phones that does the same thing only.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.920]   It's actually a little more interesting because you have to hook the laptop to the phone.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.000]   Well, on your own, does it use Bluetooth?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It uses...
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.560]   What it does is it uses the wireless, the Wi-Fi connection.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.720]   Yeah, they're actually the Nokia one uses Wi-Fi.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.400]   And then you just reach back out your 3G out to your cell phone and say, "Well, the point
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.880]   is a lot of cell phones allow this, but the cell carriers hate it because you're getting...
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.920]   You're not paying for their extra price USB dongle.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.680]   So they've increasingly on phones disabled this in the US.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.280]   I don't know what it's like in the rest of the world.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.360]   And the thinking is that AT&T said...
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.760]   And then Apple approved it and AT&T said, "Wait a minute.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   So what's it called?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.760]   It's NetModum?"
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.760]   NetShare.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.760]   NetShare.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.680]   I'm going to see if it's on there right now.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.240]   Yeah, it says...
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Let me see.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.480]   I'm downloading it.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.480]   DirectLink.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.480]   No, it's not.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.480]   I found a program called NetShaker.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.160]   Oh, no.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.080]   It's an album by Nocturnal Emissions.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.560]   That's not it, isn't it?
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.560]   Sorry.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.560]   I'm studying.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.600]   Oh, you're right.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.600]   It's off.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   Yeah, it's not there.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   It was there.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   It was there.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   It was there again.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600]   It was a scandal.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.600]   It came and went.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   It was there back again.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   All right.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   You have to...
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600]   Then there was a link for a while.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   I think Wired had it.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   And then now it's gone again.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.760]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   So what's interesting...
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   It's all AT&T.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   I think it's...
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.760]   It must be...
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   Because Apple has to approve these things.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.560]   And it's just one of those things where...
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.840]   You know, you just know it's the cellphone car, is it hate it?
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.920]   They hate it, hate it, hate it.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.400]   Are you getting 3G on your...
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.840]   I could not get 3G anywhere.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.840]   I was in San Francisco.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.840]   I didn't get 3G.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   I was so annoyed.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.840]   I think we should sue them.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.120]   Yes, sue the bastards.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   Let's make them cross into the United States and we can confiscate everything.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.120]   It's like...
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:06.720]   You know, I don't get 3G everywhere around London, everywhere around Oxford is 3G central.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   It's fantastic.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.520]   I'm very disappointed by the...
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.120]   There's no 3G anywhere I go.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.240]   Now, Leo, did you see the USA Today report?
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.160]   I think it was up yesterday where they said that Apple, when in exchange for that $300
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.280]   subsidy from AT&T extended the exclusivity contract another year with AT&T?
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   They did.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   I didn't see that.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.840]   Yeah, according to USA...
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.160]   It's on the digital home right now.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.240]   It's the second one down.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.200]   Basically what USA Today said was that Apple had an agreement with AT&T that said it
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   would be over in 2008.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.680]   So next year they could start selling with Verizon and the rest.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.920]   By getting the subsidy, they said, "We'll extend it one more year and we will make it
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   exclusive in AT&T."
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.120]   Now, I think it's a dumb move.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120]   I think it's a stupid movement.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.120]   Get out of the contract.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   Get out of the deal.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   What is that?
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.360]   I mean, well, Apple's a publicly held company.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.080]   They have a fiduciary responsibility to share all this to make the most amount of money
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   they can.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.760]   But do you think this is the most they could make?
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.400]   Well, that's my assumption.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.080]   Obviously, we don't really know the whole situation behind the deal.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.720]   My assumption is that Apple said, "Well, we're going to crunch the numbers and put $300
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   a pop.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   We figured we can make this much."
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.840]   So I think in the short term it makes sense from a shareholder perspective and a stock
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.000]   price perspective.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.920]   But over time, you're leaving the vast majority of self-owners in the United States out in
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.160]   the cold and for what?
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.640]   For nothing.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:27.120]   You have T-Mobile and I'm a firm believer that Apple should and could and probably will
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.800]   create a CDMA iPhone.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.000]   There's no reason not to after it's all said and done.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.760]   You have what three, four services here in the United States alone where you can capitalize
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.160]   on those users.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.480]   If they're selling this well, just on AT&T at that price, can you imagine how many iPhones
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.920]   Apple could sell with everyone else in the fold?
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.080]   I'd far prefer to have a T-Mobile version.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.480]   I'm not crazy about AT&T in any respect.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.480]   I can't ever see them doing CDMA.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.280]   The rest of the world is GSM.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.360]   Yeah, you might as well stay with, yeah, at this point.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.920]   CDMA is like sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, and a scale like CDMA.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.120]   Well, my thought on it is because RIM does it.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.040]   I mean, they're competing big time with Brian.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.000]   You can get a black brand Verizon right now.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.280]   Is that going to be the differentiating factor if they weren't to go to CDMA?
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   Is that what RIM's going to talk about and just shove it down on a throat saying, "No,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.600]   look, listen, we have our blackberries going on Verizon.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.720]   The iPhone is not available there.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.840]   And so look, we can give you the best service ball, but you know whatever they're going
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.840]   to be asking you.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.560]   You know, is that the differentiating factor that Apple doesn't want?"
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.000]   And I think, you know, I don't know how you can do that without competing with RIM.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.800]   Oh, wait, I want to thank Delicious right in the middle of our show.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.720]   They just changed to Delicious 2.0.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   Right.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.800]   Yeah, you see that?
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   I was not.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   Just now.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   In the middle of the show.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   No, it was yesterday.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   Was it?
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   Yes, they switched.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   Maybe you're just at Delicious.com.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   Yes, they did.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   It's good.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.960]   It's got a whole new look and I can't log in anymore.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.280]   They changed their my account.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.000]   Oh, is it the Yahoo?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Is it the Yahoo?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.600]   I might have to use the Yahoo thing.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.800]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:11.560]   So speaking of unhappy internet service providers, I guess they're kind of related to the...
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:17.240]   I think if there's anybody more hated these days than the cell phone companies, it's the
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.640]   cable companies, Comcast.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.440]   That's a segue for you.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:31.840]   So the FCC says on Friday, Comcast broke the law by slowing internet traffic for subscribers
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   using BitTorrent.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:38.720]   They would break these BitTorrent connections unilaterally, illegally, according to federal
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.480]   regulators.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.480]   And the FCC releases a press release saying, "Victory of the rule of law.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.760]   Now let's move on.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.960]   By the way."
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.480]   No fine.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.200]   No penalty.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.600]   Not even a slap on the wrist.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.240]   Just don't do it.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.600]   And Comcast says, "Well, we're not doing it anyway.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.960]   We believe our network management choices were reasonable, wholly consistent with industry
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   practices.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.320]   We've never done that."
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.440]   Comcast doesn't have to change a thing.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.280]   Got no penalty.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280]   Talk about toothless.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.040]   I don't understand, Comcast.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.480]   Comcast may be the dumbest company in the history of technology, or at least in that business.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.120]   I mean, in what 2002...
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.560]   I think it's about this on ours technically.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.440]   2002 and 2007.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.840]   The company was voted like the worst company in the world by a customer.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.840]   Yes.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.720]   Big worst customer dissatisfaction.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.880]   It has a website dedicated to its suckiness.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   Okay?
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   It's that bad.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   Well, everybody does.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.040]   I'm sure there's a Twix Sucks.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.840]   Twix Sucks.com somewhere for sure.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.920]   Yeah, but Comcast sucks.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.880]   I remember seeing a survey once where people said, "What's the worst thing that could happen?"
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   The worst thing in the world.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.680]   Comcast was actually higher than a heart attack.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.760]   It was worse than a heart attack.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.760]   That's how much people...
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   I'm not kidding.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.320]   For a company that's hated so much as you all allege...
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.800]   You love it?
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.440]   I don't dislike them.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.360]   I get good service on my cable modem.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.360]   I get good speech.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.520]   I actually do too.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   Never goes down.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.520]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:16.560]   I mean, my outages had maybe one or two that required a reboot of the...
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.680]   I'm not sure if it was me or them, but it goes away so fast you can't tell what the problem
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   was.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   I just can't complain about the...
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.680]   It's not expensive.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.920]   So you won't be running Switzerland.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.520]   Switzerland is a tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.920]   It's an ISP testing tool.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.160]   A way to see if you're in...
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.480]   In fact, I wish you would run it.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   We should all run it.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:43.120]   A way to see if your ISP is doing any of these things that Comcast said it's not doing.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.080]   It's an open source command line program designed to detect the modification or injection
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.320]   of packets of data by internet service providers.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   And they're particular.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.960]   I'm downloading it right now.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:03.480]   It's eff.org/testyourisp/switzerland.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.640]   This is very interesting.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.160]   The more people who run this and come up with the results, the better.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.400]   It's unfortunately it's command line.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.200]   It means nobody's going to run it.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   All right.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   Good.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   I'm going to run it too.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.160]   Is your ISP interfering with your BitTorrent connections, cutting off your VoIP calls, undermining
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.880]   the principles of network neutrality?
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.160]   We're on a VoIP call now and once the last time it's been cut off.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.160]   Yeah, I'm on DSL.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.960]   No, John, you like Comcast and all, but are you getting what you pay for?
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.760]   I mean, you would get like 20 megabits or something.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.760]   Are you getting 20?
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.760]   30 down.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   30 and 6.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.240]   And you're actually getting it too?
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.840]   I'm getting, I know the up is a lot better than it was.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.720]   Can I just point out just to make this even more politically relevant.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.640]   Someone in the chat room just suggested finding out the CEO of Comcast and finding out who
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.880]   he just made campaign contributions to paid $1,000 to the Congressman Marky Committee to
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.880]   get Congressman Marky re-elected.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.480]   Marky's good, isn't he?
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   So, I think Ed Marky is in fact one of the guys who's fighting for net neutrality, oddly
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   enough.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.160]   I'm not getting it.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.480]   Is the FF thing a switch slash Switzerland?
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.360]   I get a page not found.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.360]   All right.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.800]   So Switzerland is spelled with a W. You know that, right?
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   Uh huh.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   Yeah, FF.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.160]   It's a source forage project.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.040]   Actually, you could probably go to, let me see.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.040]   I'll try this here.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   Hold on a second.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   I like Switzerland slash tester IP slash switch on one, right?
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.240]   Oh, slash tester IP.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   Right.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   Oh.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.640]   So long or you go to source forage and search for Switzerland.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.440]   I've just downloaded it.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.920]   It's a, I don't know.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   This is a tar file.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.160]   No, I got another test.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   You're right.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   That was a mistake.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   That was a mistake.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   Oh goodness.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.160]   I got to build it.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   It's not going to happen.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   It's not going to happen.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.720]   You're going to build it.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.960]   You got to run a make file.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.360]   Oh, what is wrong with these people?
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   You know what?
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:09.920]   You need a little gooey that you put on your Windows machine with a big red button.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.840]   Tester IP test drive fee.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.440]   And then that's all they do.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.520]   EFF.org slash tester ISP slash Switzerland.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.280]   Folks, if you've got the, the, the, the know how and every, you know what?
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.600]   Everybody listens to it knows how to do this.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   Build it and try it.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.040]   I'd be very curious what happens.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.440]   Have you been following the scrabulous scrapple?
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.880]   Scrabulous, which I think is fantastic.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.960]   And I, you know, I, it's a, it was basically scrabble for the, for Facebook in January
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.800]   has bro rattled some swords.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.280]   They have the worldwide rights to the game scrabble and they said, guys, you got to
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   shut this down.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.920]   It's two brothers got to shut this down.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   Nothing happened.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   They sold the rights to electronic arts, which immediately started developing its own Facebook
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   application.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.520]   Now we've got some trouble because you've got a big company who says we're going to
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.520]   do it.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.640]   And they, and so finally, why didn't electronic arts give these scrabulous guys a pot full
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.880]   of cash and go that way?
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.440]   Mike, I think we talked about this last week.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.440]   My question exactly.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.120]   Uh, it seems like the best thing to do would say, here guys, you know, here's a million
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   bucks.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.000]   Maybe the scrabulous guys wanted more.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Maybe they were intractable.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.240]   Maybe they said, no, we're not going to sell.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   I don't know.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.760]   But that seems like the obvious thing.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   Just Hasbro.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.160]   They did a beautiful implementation.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.800]   It was one of the most popular applications on Facebook.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.600]   Facebook finally shut it down last week.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.040]   The scrabulous guys come back one, like one day later, they redesigned the whole thing.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.120]   They called word scraper.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.280]   And it's my guess, a little bit different.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   My, my guess from reading a bit about these guys is they wanted more.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   They thought they had the best app on Facebook and they wanted a few, at least a few million
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.240]   and that one million, you know, you might, as you say, you know, you'd offer them a million
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.560]   dollars and say, thanks, you know, let's take it and work on it.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.760]   They wanted more than that.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:55.480]   And the fact they obviously had this new version ready just kind of says, you know, they knew
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.000]   that they were, you know, they're playing hardball.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   You're right.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   They were prepared to take a minute and walk away.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   They're playing hardball.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.640]   Took them 48 hours to get this other thing up.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.440]   Now, here's the question, is word scraper different enough?
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   And it's not clear.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:17.280]   In fact, San Jose Mercury News interviewed Ethan Horowitz, an IP lawyer at Kirk and Spalding,
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.920]   King and Spalding in New York.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.160]   He said, it's going to come down to little things like squares and circles and double
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.160]   triple and so on.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.920]   He says, what they've done is taking a step in the right direction.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.880]   But I don't think it's a big enough step.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.320]   In other words, it's still too close to scrabble.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.800]   You can even change the rules on this thing.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.000]   I mean, it's not, you know, custom boards.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.200]   You could make the board look like scrabble, but you don't have to.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.480]   Oh, you know, who cares?
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.920]   It's scrabble for God's sake.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.400]   Now, let me ask you something.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.800]   I mean, when it, maybe I'm totally off here, but I think it'd be cheaper to sue than to
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   buy it.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.200]   I mean, if they want $10 million, $5 million, why wouldn't you say, listen, you know, we
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.000]   have only IP, we own the IP.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   So we're going to take it a court.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.680]   We were a huge corporation.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   That's the big stick.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.200]   No, I'm not arguing about that.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.920]   You guys might be cheaper if you had them, if you bought it and didn't do you any good.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.360]   But if you wanted an online version that actually worked and people were already used.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.680]   Well, here's the irony.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.680]   Electronic arts.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   That would be worth the money.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.160]   Electronic arts put up their version of scrabble.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.720]   It doesn't work.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   So it's been all janky.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.880]   No, the whole thing, you know, this whole story, I realized because I was doing this
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.280]   on the tech five news thing I do every day.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.240]   I was doing a daily story about scrabulous.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.160]   And I realized that the only reason this thing is even remotely interesting as a news
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.720]   item is because we like saying scrabulous.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.800]   No, it's just an interesting name.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   It's a great app.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   And we and many, many people play.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   How do you play?
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   I play.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   I had like eight boards going at once.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   I bet you you play it will.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   You're British.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   You're literate.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   I'm American.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.040]   I'm not so young.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   You people like words.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   I'm British and I'm so literate.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.080]   I don't even need to play scrabulous.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   No, you're way above that.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.880]   No, I don't do that.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.920]   Don, did you ever play scrabulous on Facebook?
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   No, I don't play.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.920]   You know what?
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.760]   I hate board games and why should I play an electronic version?
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.120]   Why am I not surprised?
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.800]   But you're literate.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   You're right.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:22.260]   You know, you know, world that in the world of idiocresies, nobody will play scrabulous.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.000]   Just remember that.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.320]   So let's move on to another story.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   Please.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.840]   A less scrabulous story.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.600]   And Nvidia, which is not nearly as much fun to say.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.200]   Nvidia is doing something very weird and it's upsetting to me and you just raised this
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.920]   issue before we started, Will, and I am a little perturbed.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.720]   So we here at Twit Live are building the ultimate gaming machine.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.720]   I'm very proud of it.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.720]   It's a beautiful machine.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.760]   That's so far six or seven thousand dollars.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:55.960]   It's going to be a killer based not by not not not not because we decide.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.360]   It's not ahead of time because the listeners and the viewers wanted it.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:09.680]   We based it on Nvidia video cards, the BFG 280 GTX three of them in SLI, which is beautiful.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.040]   And it looked like the best motherboard to put this on was based on an Nvidia chipset
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   the 790.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.040]   I will now they're pulling them.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.120]   Apparently there's problems with the chipset in Nvidia.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   According to Slash.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.360]   Not it's about to exit the chipset business.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   Oh, that's not.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   I heard they're not.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   What a crock.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   No chance.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.160]   Well, no, I think what's today.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:33.760]   I don't know what today's date is, but on August 4th, yesterday yesterday it was.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.120]   Nvidia came out and said that's nonsense.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   We're not doing that at all.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.360]   We're staying in and we still have a big horse in the race.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   We're not doing that.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   It's on Digi Times.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.320]   Yeah, Digi Times said that Nvidia is denied.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.440]   Nvidia's had some major problems in the last couple of months.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.840]   They had first announcement that a lot of their mobile GPUs were faulty and had been
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.760]   shipping faulty for the last six to 12 months.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.640]   And they're going to have to take a massive charge to possibly to fix them all.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.560]   Their basic solution for the fact that all their chips were overheating was to update
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.480]   the BIOS so the fans ran all the time.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.160]   So you got like an Nvidia based graphics card laptop.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.960]   Now your fan runs like twice as often.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.760]   So that was problem number one.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.560]   Problem number two is they discovered that there was some major issues with the 790I
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   chipset.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.120]   Well, one were using an Agum by the one.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:27.760]   Yeah, and a whole bunch of the sort of Taiwanese motherboard makers like Foxconn and Azuz and
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:32.040]   Gigabyte have all dropped their latest 790 products and are saying they're not going
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.880]   to be making any more motherboard using an actual 790I.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.400]   Yeah, well that's probably going to be one of them I think.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.680]   And then at the end of this week, Nvidia's CFO mysteriously just resigned for no reason
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.440]   whatsoever with no warning.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.920]   And we're just like spending more time with the family kind of thing.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.160]   So it's all looking a bit iffy for those guys.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.160]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:00.960]   And I'm a little bummed because frankly I've already purchased all the parts.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.960]   They're in the mail.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.560]   Well, I think the most expensive parts, the desktop graphics boards, those appear to
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.560]   all be fine.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.560]   So the 280s, the 260s.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.240]   Yeah, I got three of those, the 3280s.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.800]   Yeah, those are all fine.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.480]   It's just 1,600 bucks worth of video cards.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.720]   This is the case, the power supply for this thing, it's a 1,200 watts of power supply
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.280]   because it's got three video cards in it.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.920]   Then it's huge and it's water cool.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.080]   The power supply costs more than most PC 700 bucks for the power supply.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.600]   The case is 400 bucks, 1,000 bucks for a case in power supply.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   And I haven't even got anything in it.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   Who did you go with for the power supply?
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   PC power and cooling.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   Oh, nice.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   You guys?
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   You don't agree?
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   No, they're owned by, I believe they're not owned by OCZ.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.600]   Yeah, they are.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   In fact, we're using OCZ RAM, DDR3 RAM because it becomes pre-configured for water cooling.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   It's got a little lock on it.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.880]   It's always a toss up between OCZ and Corsair, pretty much whatever you buy on the power supply
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   or memory front.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:08.560]   You know, as we're all talking about these big time computers, I just bought the EPC-1000H
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.920]   and we're running XP.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.920]   Fantastic.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.920]   I love it.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.920]   XP.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.920]   You bought it for late, PC?
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   Oh, it's the little one.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.920]   Yeah, yeah, the little one.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.000]   And I install Linux too.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   So it's beautiful.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.560]   I'm running both and it's just absolutely...
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   You think you have the one to get?
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   Highly recommend it.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.560]   Oh, I love it.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   I love it.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   It's fantastic.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.060]   You know what's funny?
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.680]   I bought it for $649, but you can get on Newegg for $549 right now.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   I don't know if it's available.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   I should probably get more of it.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.920]   I should buy that.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.920]   That sounds great.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.800]   Talking about XP, I saw the most amazing thing this week.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   It was...
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.320]   I went to a Sony event in London.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.800]   The video is on channel flipping.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.480]   They were showing off their latest Sony Vio notebooks.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.440]   Was it running the Mojave operating system?
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.040]   Wow, that's another topic.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.080]   But it's top of the range.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.080]   Amazing Vio notebooks.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.360]   And they've all got these massive design for Windows Vista stickers all over them.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.360]   I'm like, "This is your latest thing."
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.360]   Yeah, yeah, we love these.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.760]   We're shipping millions of them.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.760]   They look fantastic.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   And I was like, "Oh, yes, sir.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.760]   Are they designed for business?"
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   And we also ship Windows XP in the box.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   I'm like, "What?"
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.760]   In the box.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:17.480]   Yeah, we ship Windows Vista pre-installed, but we also give a couple of Windows XP discs.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.000]   Because we know a lot of our business customers don't want to use Vista.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Wow.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.760]   And so they're shipping the XP discs in the box along with Vista discs.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.760]   Wow.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   How crazy is that?
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.360]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.320]   I guess that's what business users want.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   What do you think?
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.880]   Now, what I'd like to ask you guys, because we do a Windows podcast, Windows weekly.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.640]   All the rot is up in arms.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.720]   And this Mojave experiment kind of backs him up on this saying, "Vista's getting a
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.720]   bad rap.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   Here it is.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.720]   It's been a year and a half.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.720]   People should be buying Vista.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   What are they crazy?
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.720]   They're buying XP.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.640]   This Mojave experiment was kind of an interesting idea.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.880]   It was like the Folgers Crystal ad.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:58.000]   We secretly substituted Folgers Crystal for this fine coffee.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.480]   And oh, it's Folgers Crystal.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   It takes great.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.040]   So they took, I think, 150 people.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.840]   And they said, "What do you think of Vista?"
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.080]   And the people said, "The average rating was 3.4, something out of 10."
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.080]   "Yeah."
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   Nobody wants Vista.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.560]   They said, "Well, we'd like to show you the new Microsoft Windows.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.160]   This is Mojave."
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.160]   And they showed them Vista.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.760]   They didn't tell them it was Vista and did a bunch of things.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.320]   And then say, "Why do you think of Mojave?"
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.080]   "Oh, love Mojave.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   Love it.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   It's wonderful."
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   Well, guess what?
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   We've put X.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   This is really Vista.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   Ha ha!
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.120]   Now, of course, they're only showing out of the 100-some people that they interviewed.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.600]   They're only showing about 30-40 videos.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.040]   I don't know what the other people said.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.840]   Well, you know, I wrote, actually anyone out there listening to this podcast should go
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:42.960]   to marketwash.com and read the column in my analysis of this specific situation, which
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.240]   to boil it down is the following.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:51.320]   Microsoft has got their heads up their ass to even be doing this because all it does
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:59.920]   is indicate that they allowed a public perception of Vista to go so astray that they had to
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:05.520]   find some trick to get people to realize that Vista is not that bad, but in so doing,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.800]   they just proved that they don't know what they're doing because they have to.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.640]   The question is, why did they have to do this trick?
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.840]   Because they're so boneheaded, they screwed up so badly with the marketing of Vista.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.840]   Absolutely.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.400]   It's unbelievable to me that they would do this and you can go to the Mojave Project
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.600]   dot org or com or network.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:26.840]   Now you can watch this thing.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.840]   Mojave experiment.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.840]   Interesting.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   You say, what is wrong with you people?
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.840]   You're just admitting that you're idiots.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.840]   Well, you know, interesting.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:40.160]   It was a really interesting British comparison, which is the Conservative party over here,
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.120]   which is sort of like, I guess, the equivalent of your Republicans.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.520]   I did a survey a couple of years ago when they were sort of down and out in terms of
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.520]   British politics.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.280]   And they discovered that it was something ridiculous.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   Like 70% of British people agreed with their policies until they were told they were the
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.160]   policies of the Conservative party.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.760]   And then they go, oh, wow, that case.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.360]   And they go, oh, oh, my God, no.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.640]   And I seems like the same as Vista is like, you show them, show anybody Vista without
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.760]   telling them this Microsoft Vista and they think, oh, it's okay.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.560]   And as soon as you tell them, this is just like, oh, no way, no way.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:15.600]   I've heard even my, we have an accountant that comes in, is really nice woman that comes
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.920]   into books and stuff, a channel flip.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.080]   And I mean, she's the most middle of the road, non-techy woman whatsoever.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   It's purely like she has this laptop, but she carries it around in her big laptop bag.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.880]   She plonks it out and she fires up the computer and opens up the accounts thing.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.880]   And she was like, I wanted to buy a new computer, but is there a way to get one without Vista?
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.480]   I get that question all the time.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.840]   And I'm like, how do you even know?
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.840]   How do you even care?
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.000]   But it's gone so mainstream now, this perception.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.240]   Well, here's the question.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   Is it, is it legitimate?
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.600]   Is it a legitimate perception?
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.480]   Is Vista that bad?
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.640]   I don't, I don't think it is anymore.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.880]   I mean, number one, the company sold 170 million licenses as it is.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.840]   I mean, it's not like it's not doing well.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.520]   Number one, number two, I don't think it's that bad.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.280]   The driver support is back up to where it should be.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.760]   I've talked to Microsoft a few times and they've assured me that things are going to get better.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.400]   And whether or not that's true is another story.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.880]   But I think it's just this perception and like going back to what John said, that perception
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.440]   got this bad if you, I mean, because of Google.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.600]   I mean, this company is so focused on Google, it's almost forgotten that it's a software
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.600]   business until the month ago.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   Let me interrupt you on that one because I agree that you're right.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:29.280]   They're too focused on Google, but in that regard in this column that I wrote, I blame
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:36.480]   the whole thing on Apple because Apple since 2006, over two years now, they've been doing
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.160]   those PC versus Mac ads, which are nothing more than attack ads.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:46.640]   And especially the more recent ones, attack ads against Vista and Microsoft has sat there
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.240]   and watch these ads go by for years and years and did nothing.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   Yep.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   They had their head up there.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.800]   You use wherever you said it was.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.720]   Well, I don't think it's that they had their head up there behind it.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.800]   I think it's that they were really going with that school of marketing where you don't pay
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.520]   any attention to competitors claims because if you pay attention to them, you draw attention
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.040]   to the claims you draw attention to competitors and you validate it.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.120]   You didn't have to draw attention to it.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.240]   But Apple put those ads everywhere.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.000]   Yeah, they put those ads everywhere.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.960]   There was no you couldn't draw more attention to it by countering it.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   And I love Microsoft's response.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.960]   Okay.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.400]   I love Microsoft's response to this Apple thing that Brad Brooks came out a couple months
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.760]   ago and before they started this whole thing, that's a VP and Microsoft.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.720]   And he says, you thought the sleeping giant was sleeping?
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.000]   We've woken up and it's time to take our message forward.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   I mean, shut up.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.400]   I mean, please, I mean, just shut up.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.560]   I mean, I saw that, you know, the thing there's a real weird irony, which I didn't
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.360]   discuss, which I've always gotten a kick out of.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:51.080]   You know, people, you know, I've been writing for computer magazines for a long time.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.120]   And all along you hear, well, you know, the only reason everybody's writing all this positive
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:00.320]   stuff about Microsoft is because they're a big advertiser and they, you just do what advertisers
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.000]   say, which is common thing you run into.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.440]   And the magazine thing, the joke of it is Microsoft's never been a big advertiser.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.440]   They've been a cheapskate.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.000]   They don't know anything about marketing and they're advertising budget.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.040]   I don't know what it is or where it goes, but I'm telling it, never showed up in PC
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040]   magazine.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.680]   I'm going to have to get a copy right now and take a look in the advertising index in the
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.000]   back and see who's advertising.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.960]   I would venture to guess that out of a 12, any 10 issues, you'd find no Microsoft ads.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.600]   But nobody wants to, nobody wants to hammer on Microsoft.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.600]   Do they?
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   I mean, we're doing now.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:39.120]   No, but Microsoft spending $300 million on its latest PR, PR campaign or this whole
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.040]   new, this whole new campaign is huge.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.080]   And it's like what double or three times is going, well, they haven't, they haven't done
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   anything yet.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   They're still doing it.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.240]   Well, no, they started, yeah, what was that interactive site?
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.560]   There's an ad there you click on and brings it to the truth about Vista or whatever,
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.560]   a couple of weeks ago.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.400]   Well, that one, that Mojave experiment website must have cost them a hundred grand.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   You know, it's funny.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.080]   I mean, that's the fanciest thing I've seen and it's like pointless.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   And you know, it's funny.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.720]   It's in flash, not silver light.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.240]   Oh, that is funny.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   They don't even trust their own damn technology.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.080]   Here, let's, let's just see what, what somebody said about.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.440]   So it's just an informal discussion.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.800]   I'll be asking some questions and just answer them as, as you can.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.400]   This is San Francisco, by the way, they did this.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.320]   If people could see Windows Vista firsthand, just the bad things I've heard about it,
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.720]   not just her negative things.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.040]   I never tried it myself.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.720]   I wouldn't touch the thing.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   Cora Williams.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.520]   So this is the first thing you see now.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.520]   All right, I've been 30 seconds on this site.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.720]   I'm done.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.160]   So what is the, what is the takeaway?
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.520]   It's the sucks.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.720]   They launch with the negatives.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:50.480]   Yeah, I didn't think of that, that, that, that the organizational structure of that pitch
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   is pretty bad.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.320]   That's the thing when you went, we just went to the site.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.760]   Now most people do not spend more than 20, 30 seconds on a site.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.400]   At that no point did you get to a point where anything good to was said about Vista.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.880]   It was only, oh, it's terrible.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.280]   I hate it.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.400]   This is even this.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:12.120]   If you walk away from that site board within the normal 15, 20 seconds, you're walking
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.760]   away with more bad, more bad stuff.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   More bad stuff.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   Perceptions.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   God.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   If you're a shareholder, what is your mindset here?
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.200]   Your mindset is my company failed me.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.360]   My management failed me.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.960]   I mean, how the hell are we going to let this happen and watch and preside, have this management
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.560]   team preside over this degradation in our brand and it just kind of like, oh yeah, we'll
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   fix it.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   We'll fix it.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.560]   But is it too late?
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.720]   I mean, you figure Windows seven is coming down the pike soon enough.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.760]   You know, the end of next year or the beginning of 2010.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.600]   So is there enough time here for Vista to get into the business realm?
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.720]   I mean, Intel and GM have both said they don't want anything to do with Vista.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.040]   So how do you play that game?
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.560]   I mean, how do you get into how do you get Vista into the enterprise before one, oh,
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.520]   seven, even when when Bill Gates said, oh, it'll be better for business.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.840]   One, oh, seven will be better for business and everything else.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.840]   So I screwed up company.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.840]   They just screwed up.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.480]   That's just they are.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   They're screwed up.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   It's Google.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   I really think it's Google.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   They're focusing on Google and it's chasing their tail.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   And they're tailing.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   Is the result.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   Is that what they're chasing?
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.480]   I mean, you can't be both.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.480]   You have to do both, you know?
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.480]   I'm not going to argue against you.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.640]   Push out a new version as soon as possible.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.840]   Just just even they don't need to even need to admit they're wrong because I don't think,
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.200]   you know, they were that wrong, but they just need to create the perception that they're
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.600]   admitting that they're wrong.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.400]   They obviously can't push out a new version and just and just pretend like every time
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.760]   they can't do they can't do anything.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:37.560]   Their ability to control perception of the company has been somewhere along the line
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.560]   lost.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.000]   When what you describe, they can't do.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.520]   They can't do it.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.560]   They can't do anything that has to do with perception.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.720]   It's completely out of control.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.120]   It's out of their hands.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.760]   They used to, you know, really do a good job of controlling perception about the company.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.880]   But now it's outside influence that's doing it and they don't seem to have a clue about
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.880]   it.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.440]   And it just goes crazy and Apple versus PC ads will keep coming and they're going to
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   make it worse.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.000]   And he's saving grace here anywhere.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.480]   Let's talk about Yahoo yesterday.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.960]   The Yahoo board met.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:15.840]   This was the showdown, the deadline, August 1st, Carl Icahn managed to before the board
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.240]   met score three seats.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:23.480]   So he's kind of withdrawn his hostile proxy fight.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:29.320]   On the other hand, it seemed like everybody loved Yahoo at the board meeting.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.320]   T-boom Pickens didn't.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.320]   He booted.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.840]   Now, is he involved in this too?
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.840]   Seems like he's running for a while.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.240]   He sold all his shares.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.640]   He said he was fed up with this company and boom, he's out.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.600]   He wants to, he wants, he's like, he's running for president.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.640]   Now I see him on every news channel.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.840]   I got a plan.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.000]   I have a plan.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   He's running.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   He's like Ross Perot.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   He's running for president.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   I have a plan.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Wow.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   You know, I'm just there.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.720]   You're going to be checking.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:59.080]   The Yahoo shareholder meeting was that apparently AOL is objecting to Jonathan Miller being nominated
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.520]   to the board, like formerly objecting.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.920]   Miller is one of the former head honchos at AOL.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:12.520]   He was one of Carl Icahn's picks to go on to the Yahoo board and AOL is objecting on
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.800]   the basis that he's got inside a knowledge basically of a competitor.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   Oh, that's a well.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   That's a good point.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.480]   That he, you know, he left AOL.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.000]   He was tied into not working for a competitor for a certain number of years and he's off
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.160]   to the Yahoo board and now they're complaining.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:30.200]   shareholders I heard I don't know voted overwhelmingly in favor of the current board.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:36.280]   They gave him a strong thumbs up, which is so I don't understand.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.880]   They just know what they get.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.240]   Their $10 stock price is.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.240]   Well, that's the weird thing.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.600]   You know, that's just what everybody thought is that the Yahoo shareholders who were offered,
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.600]   you know, what is it?
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:52.040]   $31 for their $23 shares of Yahoo stock would would rebel at the shareholders meeting.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:53:00.440]   They voted 79.5% in favor of the chairman Roy Bostock up to up from two thirds last year.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.440]   He got more votes.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:06.160]   85% in favor of Jerry Yang.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.720]   I mean, this is a strong endorsement.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.280]   Apparently they're not upset about the.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.280]   I mean, they should be.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.840]   I mean, they're looking at an $19 to about $20 stock price right now.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.600]   They could have $33 on that price.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.640]   They could have walked away with a good amount of money.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   Number one, number two.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.040]   It's like maybe, you know, obviously I don't want to put words in his mouth and whatever
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:29.040]   else, but Jerry Yang has, in my opinion, at least presided over.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.760]   Well, basically screwing over his shareholders in a lot of ways.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.840]   He's made all the wrong decisions.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.160]   He's pushed Microsoft away.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.800]   And to be honest, Microsoft was the only way that Microsoft that Yahoo shareholders could
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.440]   walk away with a pretty good premium on their investment.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.640]   And how can they do that now?
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   How can they do that?
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.640]   I mean, it's.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.640]   Oh, you're full of crap on this one.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.640]   Now you tell.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   Why is that?
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.720]   Well, for one thing, this stock's been as high as 80.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.680]   And the other thing is you're not necessarily buying a company just so you can dump it on
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.680]   Microsoft.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:02.040]   This is not like some sort of a two-bit startup that begins life so they can suck or some
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.200]   big company to buy.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.000]   And these guys are a pretty big operation.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.840]   I mean, they got a 20.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:13.480]   Yeah, right now the market caps down to 27.7, which is nothing to sneeze at.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:17.880]   I mean, they're the number one website more often than not on the internet.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.760]   They have a lot of potential.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.880]   Jerry Yang just got in after Terry Seller.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.320]   They didn't do much in the company.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.320]   How long has Yang been in?
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:30.040]   You get less than a couple of years trying to reclaim the early momentum that they had.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.600]   I don't think it's a big deal.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   I don't.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   I'm not in the camp.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.640]   They're, oh God, let's dump the company.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.840]   No, I want to save Microsoft Yahoo.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.680]   Like, they're not a startup.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:43.720]   They shouldn't be judged like a startup because, you know, they're not just trying to get
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   bored or something.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:50.720]   But on the other hand, you know, I've seen startups with more direction and more purpose.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.720]   Okay.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.480]   So they're, you know, I don't think we should, but they have some good.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   You can't say they don't have some.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.720]   They've been around for so long.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.440]   You know, they should not be in this position.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.240]   They're basically, they are like a startup because they don't know what they're doing
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.920]   and they haven't got anything apart from this one thing, which is, you know, their popular
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   yahoo.com home page.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.560]   If you took away the Yahoo.com home page, what is Yahoo got?
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:15.000]   Frankly, you still make them sound like Microsoft.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.480]   Well, I mean, on the other hand, to take the other side of the story, I would have liked
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:23.240]   to have seen Microsoft gobble these guys up because I think it would have been the end
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   of both companies.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.520]   That's what I think.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.480]   I think from a consumer point of view, it's really, really good that this didn't happen.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:33.080]   Well, you know, like, John, you talk about market cap and you talk about these other
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.080]   things.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   And that's true.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.560]   And the revenue at Yahoo is fine and they're making the profit.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:41.680]   But as a shareholder, as you know, as Joe Q public shareholder who just invested a thousand
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.680]   shares in Yahoo, right?
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.840]   And when I look, all I really care about at that point, in all sense, I mean, is the price
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.840]   of the shares.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:55.340]   And if it's 1980 today and if I can make whatever, what, $15 extra on my investment
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.600]   per share, a 15 grand.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.360]   Well, that's what's wrong with this country, Don rising here is people are saying, let's
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   just make money.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.960]   They're not thinking long term.
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:07.600]   Well, I mean, if you look long term, Yahoo, what does it really have going for it?
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.480]   I think it's got a lot of stuff like Google.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.480]   It's got great properties.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   It's it there's admittedly.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.480]   What are it's great?
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.320]   What are its great properties, Leo?
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.960]   Well, I mean, search may not be very strong.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.120]   I think they're going to get the online advertising thing up and going.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.080]   I think that's going to work very well.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.680]   They've got a good deal with Google.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.800]   It's worth $800 million a year.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   They have some very.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   It's a Yahoo property.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   That's a good.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   It's a business as part of their business.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.960]   They've got some great properties.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.000]   I think they're not really using them very well yet.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.920]   But there's TV.com could be really strong.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.160]   I think Yahoo groups.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.120]   I mean, there's a lot I think Yahoo finances the best of.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.640]   Yeah, who finances fantastic.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   Everybody still uses it.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.880]   What's wrong with Yahoo mail?
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.640]   It may not be number one.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.720]   It's probably number two after Hotmail.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.640]   I mean, I think Yahoo's number two search number two search in this business is pretty
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.640]   darn good.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.960]   I don't think they're foundering.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.960]   They are profitable.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.960]   We're losing money.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.960]   I think you could say that.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.480]   Well, no, I mean, number one, Yahoo search in the US at least is like 21%, something a
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.920]   little bit higher obviously worldwide.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.920]   But Google's 80%.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   It's Google's 80%.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.120]   It's Google's 60%, 70%.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.400]   Right, exactly.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:18.640]   But you know, search has always kind of been the key to the advertising platform for Google.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.520]   Then we moved to advertising, which is where Microsoft really wants to go.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.680]   It's where Yahoo should be wanting to go.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.560]   Where Google really commands the industry, it's in charge.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:32.800]   If Yahoo isn't even in that space, which it barely is right now, how can it really look
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.480]   to the future and say, "We have a lot of opportunities for growth.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   We're going to make a ton of money in advertising and we're going to supplant Google as a leader
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.480]   in that space."
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.880]   I don't see that happening.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   I mean, basically you're looking at it.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.320]   You need to come and see it by the way.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.320]   That was the wrong property.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:48.320]   I apologize.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.880]   You'd think it would be broadcast.com, which is profitable.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:54.280]   broadcast.com and there's nothing there.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   So all the logic that you have done is correct from kind of a cold-blooded perspective.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.240]   But the fact of the matter is, there's potential here.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:12.320]   Now, that said, I will agree with everyone who ever says the company's disorganized.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.680]   And you come talk to people that are working there or people that were going to work there
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.960]   or people that are in and out of there.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.080]   They'll tell you the same thing, that there's no structure.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.680]   It's like a glob.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.360]   There's no, but they don't have an organization type of person in there.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.720]   They don't have an alpha-slown as what they need.
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:34.680]   Some guy who can come in there and instead of just trying to buy more crap, it's almost
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.560]   like a junk collector, this site.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.560]   But they have some value.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:41.000]   But these things are of some value and I think it's possible they could cobble this
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   together.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.480]   Nobody knows who reports to who.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.560]   I mean, it's just a complete mess that company.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.280]   I mean, it's very poorly structured.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.520]   It's a disorganized thing.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.520]   Some things work.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.520]   Some things don't.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.160]   And they buy dumb things now.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.760]   Well, essentially, though, selling it at this point would be saying, "Okay, we give up.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.760]   It's more valuable."
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.160]   And I don't think it's worth, I think it's worth, I think it's reasonable to say it's
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.920]   worth more than 33 bucks a share.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:05.400]   Well, not that, but there's apparently a number of patents.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.080]   If you really start looking into this, and I've written about this too, and I think it
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.600]   was in Market Watch last week, there's a number of very obscure patents that these
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.840]   guys, every so often get into patent mode.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.240]   And they've filed lots of interesting patents that don't seem to have anything to do with
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:24.160]   their business, and it's believed by some people that one or two of these patents is
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.560]   really what Microsoft's after.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.760]   So they can put the screws to Google, perhaps, and they're not after anything else.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.280]   So that's interesting.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   I thought that's interesting.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.480]   This week was not Google, sorry.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.320]   Best thing that Yahoo did this week was their take off of the search engine, the Yule?
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.320]   Yeah, I was saying.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.800]   They built, which is now the take off of Cool.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   What the heck was that?
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   Cool.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   It's pretty cool.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   It was junk.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.040]   Oh, it is awful.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   Is it awful?
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.360]   Do we think the cool junk?
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.400]   They claim, first of all, they've indexed more pages.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.400]   They're not going to use page rank.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.640]   They're going to use what they say is a better way to rank stuff.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   It's terrible.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.640]   It's a terrible site.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.720]   I mean, I did a bunch.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.240]   I mean, I did a column.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:10.920]   I hate to keep plugging myself, but what else I got to do in my spare time.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.640]   This week in PC Magazine.com, go check it out.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.120]   I did a search on, you know, Sergey Brin.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.440]   They got nothing on him, but they got a bunch of stuff on their own people.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.080]   I did a vanity search.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   They can't even find Devorak.org/blog.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.360]   I mean, Devorak, they can't even find my, it seems to me that if you look somebody up
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.520]   on a search engine, the first thing it would do is say, well, I wonder if there's a, perhaps
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:39.720]   a domain name, you know, that that guy, which has got the guy's name in it.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.000]   It did really well on my vanity search.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Did it find the deal?
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   First thing.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.160]   These index sites, I think index pages, I should say, I guess is a difference, but I
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.480]   think it's a bunch of hogwash.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.560]   I just did a quick little thing on, on cool here.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.560]   Twit, right?
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.560]   We did Twit.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.160]   127,440 results.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.200]   I do it on Google for over four million.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.400]   But are they four million?
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400]   Are those better?
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400]   All better?
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.400]   I mean, how many do you need?
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.280]   Did you need the extra 800, whatever million?
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.400]   No, but the ones I guarantee the ones on Google are better.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.400]   They are.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.080]   I mean, I go on to, on Google is twit.tv first one.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.800]   I go on to, to cool, whatever.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800]   This week in tech.com.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.800]   Same site.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   That's the same site.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.800]   Same site.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.800]   That's right.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:25.440]   My new favorite search engine of all is, is the Pragerpedia.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.680]   I love the Pragerpedia.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.680]   We talked about this last week.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.680]   I tried.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.920]   The first I did, I logged on to Pragerpedia.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.560]   I typed in Will Harris and it came up with a, with a real answer and I thought, well, that's
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560]   it.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.760]   Pragerpedia is, is it for now?
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.760]   Pragerpedia.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.760]   Well, anything.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   Pragerpedia.net.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.560]   It's, it's absolute genius.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.040]   So the one thing I found out about the cool search thing, which I got a kick out of, which
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040]   I'm not the blog.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.120]   I have the, I took a screenshot.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.680]   It seems to match photos, you know, it will take your thing.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.400]   If I were you, I'd be mad about the photo part.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.280]   A random photo.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.200]   And then they got one with me and, and if my picture was shown, I'm John Stossel.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.720]   No, I agree.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.880]   The photo algorithm is not working too well.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.720]   It's kind of strange.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.280]   But I do like the magazine layout.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.000]   I like the categories.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.480]   Here's the real problem cool has and it's, and it's inexplicable with all the money they
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.480]   spent on PR.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.480]   They got the biggest launch I've ever seen a site have.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.200]   In fact, such a big launch that they were down most of Monday.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.440]   What the hell is with the name?
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.440]   You can't spell it.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.440]   You can't pronounce it.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.440]   It makes no sense.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.120]   And by the way, they claim it's Gaelic, it's Irish for knowledge.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.000]   It's not, it's not even a real word.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.360]   I have to say the best thing I just, I had to do the vanity search on cool.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.120]   I've Googled and I, and I cooled.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120]   It doesn't even work.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.600]   Is it a cooled will?
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.160]   Yes, you can't even do that.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:52.760]   And the, and the discussion page for Wikipedia articles for deletion will Harris comes before
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.760]   the Wikipedia.
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.760]   I saw that.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.400]   Well, they got that one right.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.920]   So, right.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.440]   By the way, the funny thing about the Wikipedia, which is the only time I got close to the
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:08.760]   devorac.org, you know, attribution is that it was a Wikipedia that came up like on page
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   three.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.400]   So, my Wikipedia entry, but in all the press material, they went on and on about how it's
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.400]   all too much Wikipedia crap shows up in Google.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.160]   We're trying to avoid that.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.320]   Well, Power Set made some money.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.560]   They sold a Microsoft because they were a good way to keep media search.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.360]   Maybe that should have taken that point of view.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:33.200]   I think the interesting thing about cool is that they clearly knew what they were doing
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.480]   purely in PR.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:42.000]   They do very well in all, like this, the A-list blogger searches like Scoble, you know, those
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.280]   pages are great.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.280]   They're well done.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.840]   Obviously, a human hand involved.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.240]   No, that's what I was, that's my complaint.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.520]   It was obviously hand-tweaked for people.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.520]   Yeah, and not for you.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.520]   Not for you.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.520]   Obviously, no.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.600]   I was cut out.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.960]   But they had everybody, you know, a bunch of people were hand-tweaked knowing that they
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.400]   do it because everybody does, if you have enough web presence, you always do a vanity
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.320]   search because you know what to expect.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.600]   And so if, like, you know, it seems to me that if I'm going to do a vanity search on
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:14.920]   myself, I'm expecting to see something from either the blog or PC Magazine or MarketWatch
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.640]   or even this show, I got none of those.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.320]   It's better if you search for John Devorek, not John C. Devorek, by the way.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   You get a great picture.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   No, I did both.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   I did both.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.560]   Actually, it's failed on John C. Devorek more often than not.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.000]   John Devorek actually did better.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.160]   Although the number two result is Master of 500 Hats, an article that says John Devorek
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.160]   is a big fat idiot.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   That's what you think of it.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.720]   He didn't hear that because he's answering the phone.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.720]   Let's move on.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   Sorry.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   Before we...
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   No, no, no, nothing happened.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   I get phone calls.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.200]   Nothing happened while you were gone.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200]   It's all fine.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.560]   Let me take a break.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.440]   We want to thank our folks at ZVISA and then we'll come back with more news stories.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.400]   This is a Twitch you're listening to with Don Rizinger from digitalhome.cnet.com.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.520]   There are many other places now.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   R is Technica.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.520]   Where else do you write for?
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.680]   Don, leave a bunch of stuff.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680]   Mashable.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.080]   We do computer world, information week, IT world, and also check out the digital home
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   podcast.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.080]   We do that too every week.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.760]   Now we're starting video, a daily video thing too on Cnet.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.080]   Is it going to be streaming live?
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080]   Oh, no, no.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.720]   I'm not going to compete with you, Lea.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.640]   That's the most popular suicide thing.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.960]   I think I'm the only one that's crazy enough to do this, fortunately.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.480]   Also Will Harris from the UK and the channel Flip and, of course, John C. Devorek.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.680]   This show brought to you by the good folks at VISA.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.400]   We all have better things to think about when it comes to shopping online.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.280]   You know, you want to think about what you're going to buy.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.960]   Am I going to go to Zappos to get those fine Adidas?
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.560]   You don't want to have to be thinking about online fraud.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.640]   That's why you use your Visa card.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.360]   I can't tell you how much I wish I'd been using my Visa card.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.080]   Last time I shopped online, all the purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.400]   And I wish I'd had this ad in front of me then.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.320]   Visa has many ways to prevent detect, resolve online fraud.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.000]   Very sophisticated, real time fraud detection software.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   Here's the key.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.960]   All you got to really remember is zero liability.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.720]   You are not liable.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   Fun authorized purchases.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.720]   It's just that simple.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.240]   That's peace of mind.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.480]   That's how they do it, babe.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.840]   Safe, secure, vice, vice, up back there.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:19.480]   We thank them so much for their support, for however much longer it lasts of this weekend
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.480]   tag.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.080]   All right, let's move on.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.800]   We have other stories in the upper today.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.520]   Well, actually before I finish, let's finish Yahoo!
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.520]   Real quickly.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.840]   Carl Icahn does not show up.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.640]   They haven't decided who the other board members are going to be.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.560]   But it seems like business as usual, except that I don't know how they're going to incorporate
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.200]   Carl Icahn into these board meetings.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.720]   You won't show up ever.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.480]   You didn't even come to the show?
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.040]   It's just like it's a token?
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.040]   I don't know.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.200]   It's just that's a guy's kind of a character.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.760]   Let's see what happens.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.800]   The next two months are going to be really crucial, I think, for Yahoo.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:58.400]   Are they going to pull anything out that's even remotely interesting or better off?
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.400]   I'm rooting for them.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:04.480]   I don't know about you guys, but they're an internet pioneer and I'm just rooting for
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480]   them.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.480]   I want them to survive.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.240]   I think it's better to have an independent Yahoo than a Yahoo that's part of Microsoft
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.080]   of all things.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.120]   Yeah, I hope they do well.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.320]   It's not that I think that Yahoo should just be sold and cut up and done away with.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.320]   It's just that in my mind at least, and maybe this is me being like, "John said the cold
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:27.320]   blooded accountant that I used to be," but I have to look out for the shareholders in
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:32.000]   my mind at least and the shareholders I think would benefit best if they had sold it to
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   Microsoft.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.800]   But if they're not going to do what it's going to happen now, I hope it turns out well.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.200]   Did you guys read the New York Times Sunday Magazine last week?
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.040]   Big article about internet trolls of all things.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:50.880]   It says, "Trolls are a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.760]   much everyone else online."
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:59.080]   It kind of stuns me that the New York Times, the Auguste Grey Lady, would devote an entire
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:03.440]   long feature article on internet trolls.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.960]   How do they define it?
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:11.760]   Okay, let's see if I can find a good definition.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.240]   I mean, the typical slash dot, it's currently one of those guys, everyone's a troll.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.800]   In the late 1980s, internet users adopted the word troll to denote someone who intentionally
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.880]   disrupts online communities.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.440]   I think that's a very general definition, but I think it's true.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.200]   Today the internet is much more than an esoteric discussion for us.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.720]   It's a mass medium for defining who we are to ourselves and others.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:43.960]   But trolling has evolved from ironic solo skit to vicious group hunt.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:49.040]   I don't think they're mixing up definitions with flamers.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.200]   Well, is it flamers as far as flamers as subset of trolls?
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.200]   I don't think so.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.680]   I think trolls are people who, I mean, I don't think so.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.000]   No, my definition of troll isn't this at all.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.880]   It's not a troublemaker.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.640]   What's interesting is they claim that trolls keep score using something called lules, a
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.280]   corruption of LOL or LAFL.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.280]   What are they talking about?
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.280]   Are they making this up as they go along?
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.200]   Has it been reading too much of the Lord of the Rings?
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:18.960]   Yeah, well, I've never heard of this, but lules, but okay, I mean, I presume that somebody
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.160]   did some research.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.160]   Correct me.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160]   Have you ever heard of this?
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.160]   I think they got suckered.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.400]   I think somebody told them this crap made it up and these guys roll really cool.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.800]   Lules means the joy of disrupting another's emotional equilibrium.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.360]   So a troll says, here's the idea.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:40.760]   You look for someone who's full of it, a real blowhard, not like anybody here.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:49.080]   Then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama, LAF and LULES.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.200]   The rules would be simple.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.440]   One, do whatever it takes to get LULES to make sure the LULES is widely distributed.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.360]   This will allow for more LULES to be make.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.400]   The game is never over until all the LULES have been had.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400]   Am I saying it right?
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   LULES?
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.640]   I never heard of this.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.840]   How you spelling it?
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   L-U-L-Z.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.480]   Wait, let's do a poll.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.480]   Wait, chat room.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.040]   We need your help.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.800]   Wait, and also let's do a poll.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.720]   You haven't heard of it.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.920]   I haven't heard of it.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.840]   Have you other two guys heard of it?
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840]   No.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.840]   No.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.000]   This is the New York Times.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   All right.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   Anybody in it?
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   Maybe.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.120]   It could be the New York Times is so ahead of the curve.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120]   None of us about it.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120]   That'll be the day.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.040]   Okay, so I'm asking, I mean, look, if anybody would know, it's our very literate.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:40.480]   We've got 300 people in one chat room, about 500 people in another chat room, thousands
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.000]   of people watching.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.800]   Guys, gals, what's LULES?
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.800]   Anybody heard of it?
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:53.360]   I'm looking at Encyclopedia Dramatica, and they have a definition in there, which I think
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.400]   that somebody obviously, I don't know where this came from.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.480]   I've never heard of this before.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.680]   There's not much on, if you Google LULES, LULES, or whatever the heck it is, you don't find
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   much.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.400]   Encyclopedia Dramatica is a catchphrase, which serves as a catch all explanation for any
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:14.280]   trolling you do, or any internet drama you cause to happen.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.840]   It's trying to create drama.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.840]   Now, I'm in the urban dictionary.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.840]   I'm in the urban dictionary.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840]   Yeah, urban dictionary.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840]   Oh, sorry.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.840]   Well, it's in there too.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.000]   Beginning as a plural variant of LOL, LULES was originally an exclamation, but is now often
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.440]   used as a noun, meaning interesting or funny internet content.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440]   It comes from...
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.440]   Good.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440]   Now, here's what I don't understand.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.440]   Figure this one out.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:40.080]   It says, LULES is the one good reason to do anything from trolling to rape.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.920]   After every action taken, you must take the epilogic do-by disclaimer.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.680]   I did it for the LULES.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.680]   What?
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.680]   Here's another one.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.680]   Here's another one.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.280]   This one is in a critical mass blog archive.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.720]   LULES comes from the acronym LOL, meaning Laughing out loud.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.200]   Yeah, because you're saying basically I did it for the LOLs.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.520]   I did it for the laughs.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.520]   I've heard LOLES.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.520]   Yes.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.520]   It's...
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520]   You know what?
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   This is...
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.120]   I think the times got burned.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120]   I think they got burned.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   I think they got burned.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.120]   They got a Rick roll.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.120]   Exactly.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.160]   They got Rick roll with a crock.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.800]   This is like not a main thing at all.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.800]   It's in the Sunday time...
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.000]   It was in the Sunday times magazine.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.240]   Well, who's the writer?
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.440]   Let's call out the writer.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.120]   The Fias Schwartz.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.640]   Do you think somebody told him...
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   A Fias, D-U-P-S definition.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.320]   They just told it M for the LOLs.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.880]   M-A-T-T-A-T-H-I-A-S-S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.360]   It looks like they got interviewed.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360]   I think they got lulled.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.040]   That's what I think happened.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.120]   They did an interview.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:53.040]   It looks like they did interviews with a number of /b/guys who clearly took the reporter
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.560]   for a ride and are laughing all the way to the back.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:02.000]   Now there is actually a very interesting real news story tied to this, which is that
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.400]   two women at Yale Law School sued posters who posted violent fantasies about them on a college
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.360]   admissions message board.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:15.080]   They've won the lawsuit, I understand, but the lawyers are in hiding because they're getting
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.920]   countersued.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.560]   They're getting lulled back themselves.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.480]   So there is certainly a...
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.720]   I think there is a culture on the internet of this vandalism, this gaming.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:34.320]   Yeah, if you'll read the caption, this guy, "Weave," is that his name?
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.320]   What kind of name is "Weave?"
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.920]   Anyway, this is not his real name.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.720]   It's part of a growing internet subculture with fluid morality and disdain for pretty
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.360]   much everyone else online.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.360]   Look at him.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.360]   Look at him.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.360]   He's fantastic.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.920]   Look at him.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.960]   He's beautiful.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960]   He looks like a troll.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.560]   He looks like he belongs under a bridge.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.040]   A little troll.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.560]   He's an actual troll.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.160]   I love the caption.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.000]   It's just the trolls among us and just this picture.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.920]   I don't have a link to that.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.160]   Send me a link to that.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160]   I will.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.240]   It's a Sunday Times magazine.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.400]   If you just go to New York, M&YTimes.com, I'll tell you what, I'll put it in our...
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.400]   Well, I can't put it in Twitter because they've...
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400]   I no longer have a Twitter.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.000]   Send it on a comment thing on Skype.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   It's comment on Skype.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   Okay.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:19.920]   Well, I can't.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.040]   You do that for him, guys, because I don't have access to Skype from this computer.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.040]   Skype's on its own special band.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.040]   Oh, that's right.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.560]   You got some weird lash up.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.720]   I have a weird...
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:30.720]   That's a good...
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.280]   I like that word lash up.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.960]   Yeah, it's an old...
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.080]   It's like a Britishism.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.520]   It's like when you're driving a triumph down the highway...
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.520]   It's...
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.880]   In Britain getting lashed means getting completely drunk.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.880]   Oh, there you go.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.040]   Never heard that, but okay.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.320]   You go out with lash.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.760]   What did the Brits think about lols?
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.160]   I think that New York Times just got Rick rolled.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.680]   I think you're right.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.680]   The more I think about this, when I first saw the article, I thought, "Oh, that's good.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.680]   They're covering..."
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.080]   But then as I read it, I'm glad you actually pushed that, John, because as you read it,
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:09.000]   it actually has nothing to do with the trolls we know, which are jerks and message boards
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.600]   and comments.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   Nothing to do with that.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.600]   No, this is like something.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.200]   I don't know where they get it.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200]   I mean, this is...
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.400]   I mean, it's kind of interesting, but...
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.440]   Well, I'm sure the people reading it were.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.840]   Darling, did you hear what's happening on the internet these days?
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.840]   Exactly.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.120]   They've got these things called trolls.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.680]   Oh, dear.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.680]   What is that, darling?
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:31.680]   Keep score.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.520]   They're keeps score with something called lols.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.040]   Is it like croquet, darling?
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040]   I don't know.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.040]   Have another martini.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.040]   I think I will.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.480]   Without buying into the New York Times stereotype.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.280]   Well, they're just country club liberals drinking their shadne.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.200]   Let's see.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.040]   Any other big stories?
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.400]   Man, arrested for YouTube baby food threat.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.440]   My daughter's all excited about that.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.520]   Abby's kind of giddy in here.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.520]   Do you know about lols?
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520]   Do you know any trolls?
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.320]   My daughter's in here, and she's just going crazy.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.040]   There a New York man named Anton Dunn has been posting offensive videos on YouTube in
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:17.600]   which he claims to have killed people and infected more than 1,500 women with AIDS.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.880]   His name is Trash Man.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.200]   His videos are picked up by the tabloid press.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:28.120]   Now he's under arrest for putting deep videos up about poisoning Gerber products.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.480]   Yeah, well, that guy's a total creep.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.480]   Not as good as he does.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   Thank goodness.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.480]   Now, that's a troll.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:38.120]   I wonder if he collected any lols for that.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.120]   That's my...
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.400]   Your Honor, I did it for the lols.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:48.440]   I saw that apparently Mobile Me is back up again now.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.440]   Legitally.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.440]   General, some old friends.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.520]   Cisco Franco's still dead.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.440]   Mobile Me is back up.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:03.760]   I feel like the, you know, back in the Iraq war where they had that guy, the general,
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.040]   who was just the most improbable guy, you know, we are slaughtering them in the streets.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.080]   That picture of him just with the caption like, "There is nothing wrong with Mobile Me.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.320]   Mobile Me is fine.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.320]   We are all fine here.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.360]   We are slaughtering the infidels."
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   Fine.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360]   It's fine.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.160]   It's all fine.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.880]   So they confirm there's water on Mars.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   That's good news.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:23.880]   I'm moving there.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.280]   I thought we already knew that.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.480]   I thought they kept on talking.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.760]   Every year they have nothing, another thing on Mars.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760]   Every year I think.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.520]   They're talking about this water, you know?
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.520]   You're right.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.520]   Every year.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.920]   In fact, two or three years ago when I was up, but tell you right at the tech fest up
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.920]   there, there was just one of the NASA guys.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.920]   It was a Mars expert.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.760]   I guess he was from JPL.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.320]   Was talking about that underneath the surface, there's tons of water and they all know it.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.440]   Now, every time that it comes around, they're finding water again.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.200]   We've got more water here.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.200]   So here's the deal.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:55.560]   We've seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the Odyssey, which is the
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.240]   Mars Orbiter, and in disappearing chunks.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.400]   Remember the Phoenix?
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   So those white chunks, it scraped some soil and then saw what chunks and then they ablated,
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.760]   they disappeared.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.440]   But this is the first time, according to William Boynton of the University of Arizona, Martian
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:14.920]   water has been touched and tasted.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:15.920]   Who tasted it?
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.920]   I don't know.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:17.920]   That's what he said.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.360]   I want to talk to this guy.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.840]   I want to talk to this guy.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.840]   He used it.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.840]   Now, we find oil on Mars.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.560]   When they find oil on Mars, then we know we've got some.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.320]   Yeah, then they'll be an attack.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.920]   If we find oil on Mars, we're all, believe me, there'll be lots of Mars exploration going
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.920]   on.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.920]   Right now, they found water.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.960]   The next thing that goes up to this should plant shrubs.
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.880]   Bring me a shrub.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   A shrub.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.320]   All right, let's pause for a moment.
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.760]   I don't think you get any sillier.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:54.480]   For a mention from audibleaudible.com/twit, they are the folks who do those great audiobooks.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.960]   We all love so well.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.680]   50,000 titles.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.360]   If you are in the car and you're listening to podcasts, if you listen at the gym, if you
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.320]   listen to audio content, you really ought to try audiobooks.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:12.760]   What a great way to expand your horizons, to learn, to enjoy, to entertain yourself.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.480]   50,000 books, you'll never run out.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.560]   We do a podcast with the Raj Savage.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:21.880]   She's rowing across the Pacific Ocean, and I gave her an iPod full of books.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.440]   She listens to it more than a book a day because she listens 11 hours a day.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.120]   That's averaging more than one book a day.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   Thank goodness.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.240]   I'm going to be doing 100 books because she's been going powering through them.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.520]   But she says, I don't know what I'd be doing without those books to listen to.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.040]   I'd be going out of my nut.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.200]   Audible podcasts.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.840]   I mean, audible.com/twit.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.120]   Audible and I thought this would be a good one for you.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120]   Let me see.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.160]   Oh, no, I can't find it now.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.920]   Can I give you a recommendation?
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.920]   I never let you guys go ahead.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   Sorry.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.320]   I didn't mean to jump in.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320]   No, please do.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:04.400]   No, I've been listening to Dreams from My Father.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.120]   This is a Barack Obama.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.080]   Right up, he reads it.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.480]   He reads it very well.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:14.960]   So regardless of your, of your policies on the issues, that's a very interesting lesson.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.240]   Dreams from My Father is story of race and inheritance.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.000]   Yeah, let's make that our part.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.160]   I like to listen to Audible books where they're actually read by the author rather than by
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.800]   somebody else because I always think that brings just a little something extra.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.800]   Well, if they can read.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.800]   There are some.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.800]   Well, yeah.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.880]   There are some where I think, boy, they really should have got a pro on this one.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.960]   They really could have done a good job with a pro on this one.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.520]   But no, Obama does read very well.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:44.960]   I think he's quite, quite polished in this and says it is the story of his father.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.680]   This was a Grammy award winner, by the way, for best spoken word album of 2005 before
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.640]   he was even a twinkle in John McCain's eye.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.520]   And I'm also recommend if I can, can I go for a double header because I'm reading two
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.520]   books in the book?
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.840]   I told you, I was the throng star wars, the throne trilogy by Timothy's.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.480]   No, you may not.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:12.120]   Yeah, the best post, post, uh, return to the Jedi Star Wars books.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120]   You may not.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.560]   I start with you may not record.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.960]   You know, there's actually there's so many Star Wars books on Audible, but there's so
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.440]   many Star Wars books in general, but almost all of them are on Audible.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.880]   There's so many Star Wars books on Audible that they actually have their own section.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.040]   Hey, what's a, well, on the top, the throne books are the best.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040]   Are they?
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.800]   Oh, those are ones to read books.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.640]   Definitely the three throne trilogy books on the best you'll ever.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.440]   T H R.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.440]   A W.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.440]   All right.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.440]   What a nerd.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.480]   I was so impressed with the Obama and then he picks the Star Wars trilogy.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:48.480]   Can I?
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.640]   By the way, when did this new Star Wars movie come out?
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.760]   Are they coming out or whatever?
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.360]   It is this cartoon.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.520]   It just came out or it's coming.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.520]   I saw the first one.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.080]   Yeah, it's over here next week.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:04.960]   It's a, it's an extended version of the anime series they did on Cartoon Network.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.880]   They did like a few seasons of a Star Wars cartoon on Cartoon Network.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.280]   It sounds so horrible in so many ways.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280]   Yes.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:16.960]   Apparently it's it's it's okay, but not great.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.240]   It's worth a trip.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.480]   It's not exactly, you know, worth a duck.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.440]   It's no throng drugs.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.880]   It's no throng trilogy.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.880]   No throng trilogy.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:30.120]   Anthony Daniel C-3PO reads the throne.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.120]   You want it?
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   Brilliant.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.120]   You actually got to hear this.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.040]   I got to play a little bit of it for you because it's C-3PO.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.040]   Really?
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:42.880]   You're permission, Admiral, but I doubt card is foolish enough to just sit around waiting
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.400]   for us to arrive.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.840]   Pelion observed.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.760]   An undetectable mid-range scan of the asteroid that the Grand Admiral had ordered had just
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.760]   come up negative.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.600]   Don't you feel like it's C-3PO the whole time though?
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.600]   Oh, brother.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.600]   Nice.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.600]   He way will likes it.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600]   That's the same.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   Oh, come on.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:03.280]   That's that subtle British kind of a foppish sound.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.160]   You can get anything from subtle British foppish sounds to some of the best literature
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.240]   the world has ever known.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.120]   It's all or Barack Obama.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.680]   It's all on audible.com/twit.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.840]   We thank them so much for their support.

[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:23.760]   was free.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   That way, free.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.760]   That way, for you.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.000]   You get your one book free.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.120]   The first book, but you're not signed up.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.400]   If you're already signed up, you don't get it for free.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.320]   The first taste is always free.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   That's right.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.360]   Tiz, you know, they have a drinking game.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.120]   When I bounce on my ball, they drink.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120]   I don't see.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.120]   If you're a drink, I don't know why you keep drinking.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.040]   It's a drink like that.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.160]   You might as well just like John's reaction.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.160]   What?
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:58.440]   It was a little out of context, wasn't it?
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.440]   What other stories?
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.760]   I'm going to throw it to you, Will Harris.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.000]   You seem to have a be a font of knowledge.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.200]   Sorry, I am a font of knowledge this week because I do know real work.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:11.600]   How about this web log zinc refusing or not paying its bloggers?
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.360]   Loads of web log zinc sites practically shuttering.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.560]   We should get Calicannis on.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.320]   This was his old company sold it to America Online.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.880]   America Online is struggling right now.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.360]   I'm going to say, and they provide the bandwidth for this show.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.640]   I certainly-- hello, guys at AOL.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.800]   I do hope that as you shut down parts of your empire, you'd leave us up and running,
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.800]   if you don't mind.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.120]   Yeah, the free podcast hosting is the last to go.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:38.040]   Will they claim that they were-- although the web logs in sites were mostly ahead of
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:42.760]   targets in terms of traffic and revenue, that they nonetheless were over budget.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:47.720]   And so basically put an embargo like no new posts for the next month.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.720]   What?
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:49.720]   Oh, brother.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:55.280]   So some sites like the unofficial Apple web log had to resort to just not running, like
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.920]   chuttering to one post a day.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.880]   That's the greatest site in the world.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:00.880]   That's very frustrating.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.880]   It's crazy.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:07.280]   And they put out the guy that's in charge of the web logs division at AOL, put out sort
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.120]   of like an all hands memo like nothing to see here.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.120]   Everything's fine.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.120]   Don't worry.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.120]   You don't need to be paid.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.920]   Well, didn't they say that I'll be fixed by August 1st?
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.520]   And then of course, it never really happened.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520]   Right?
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.520]   And it never--
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520]   So--
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.520]   What's going on over there?
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.520]   It's like--
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.520]   It's clear.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.520]   It's easy.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.000]   And gadget is the biggest of these, right?
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   Now, what is this?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.960]   Engage it mobile, and gadget HD, then they have download squad for the software.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.400]   So that's like their tech division, right?
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.240]   And so now, and gadget is the one that's not affected by this?
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240]   They're profitable.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.680]   No, they pretty much left Engadget as it was.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.920]   But it was a lot of the other blogs like the unofficial Apple one and some of them,
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.400]   maybe the TV ones and the slightly more niche ones.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.120]   But of course, I mean, they said we're not going to pay bloggers for another month to
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.120]   post anything.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:02.080]   But of course, the next month, they still get paid based on the popularity of the blogs
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.560]   if they don't post for a month.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.440]   Obviously, the blog's popularity goes down as they get paid less the next month.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:11.640]   So they're sort of in their interest to post for nothing, which is a lot of credit.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.640]   Clever.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.120]   So maybe that's the master plan.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.000]   It's that AOL just wants to get all its floss and free posts.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.560]   And then they say next month, hey, you did it for free last month.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.560]   Why not do it for free this month?
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.400]   Now Nick Dinn has been doing this lately too.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.160]   I mean, I don't know if you guys been watching that.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.160]   He still pays.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.160]   He does at least pay.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.160]   He still pays, right.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.960]   But he keeps on dropping that.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.240]   And I don't know, is this like a new trend developing in these blog networks?
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.240]   I don't know.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.240]   There's other ones out there.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.240]   What's the other one I'm thinking about?
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.720]   You would think that the banner ad sales seem to be very strong.
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:44.080]   This seems to be a good, despite this failing economy, it seems to be still an odd thing.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:47.040]   It might not be part of the economy.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.160]   You would think these sites will be doing very well right now.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.720]   What are they having trouble for?
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.120]   Well, you know, there's the banner ad things are getting really low CPMs now.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.520]   And everybody in the advertising business is shifting over to podcasts.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.920]   No, to video podcasts.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.920]   That's what I meant.
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.160]   Yeah, to video podcasts.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:08.480]   And they're all want to do pre-roll and, you know, there's all this new stuff.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.040]   We know you're not going to watch the rest of us.
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.920]   So let's get our ad in real quick.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.920]   All right.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.120]   I mean, I think we're sold out.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.400]   I want to say something to it.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.520]   The Twitter audio podcasts are sold out.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.240]   We're very close to it.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.840]   In fact, we've had to add inventory.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.040]   So there I don't I think the economy is not so bad for some.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.040]   I don't know.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:32.560]   Well, I think what's going to happen is that as the economy tightens, advertising spend
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.200]   moves to more measurable media of which, you know, internet is one of the big ones.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.000]   Although it's still experiment.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.760]   In terms of sort of like the web blogs and the and the gorgas, they're still doing pretty
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:51.840]   well, but they're still a relatively relatively small segment of the market, the advertising
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.040]   market that's kind of insulated.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:28:00.360]   They're, you know, when you're TV advertising, I think we're seeing is going massively down
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:06.440]   and newspaper advertising is going massively down because blogs are such a relatively small
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.440]   part of it.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.200]   You're not going to notice much of it much of a downsizing on that.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.200]   There we go.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:19.840]   I was just wondering if AOL is paying for other areas that it's doing poorly and you know what
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:20.840]   I mean?
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.640]   We're just going to take money from the web blogs, and carry in.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.920]   We'll just pay for other, you know, you can't imagine that it's one of the most expensive
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:28.240]   AOL divisions to run.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.680]   Can you Ryan Block left, of course, in gadget and maybe picked a perfect time to do that.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:34.680]   Where'd he go?
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:41.960]   Well, he started his own he and Peter Rojas, who started in gadget, are starting some sort
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.040]   of tech blog, right?
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.040]   Some sort of tech thing.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.360]   I don't think it's social element to log.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:51.240]   I think it's kind of going to be like a social networky kind of thing with a sort of
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.120]   probably almost certainly with a video element.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.320]   That's the elevator pitch.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:00.880]   Well it's a social networky thing with a video element.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.880]   You can't go wrong with that nowadays.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.240]   Hey, it worked for YouTube.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.240]   That's your catalyst.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:10.400]   Yeah, you, but I think you also have to add green to it.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.400]   Green.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.400]   There you go.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.280]   It's a green social network with video elements, user generated content.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.800]   What other buzzword can we throw at?
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.440]   Oh, and lots of lulls.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.440]   Yes.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.440]   Lots of that.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.000]   The lulls in the action.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]   It's lulls.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.280]   You know, let me check lulz.com.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:32.840]   Maybe maybe that needs to be the title of the show actually should be in it.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:33.840]   After the lulls.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.000]   We're only in it for the lulls.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.760]   God knows we're not in it for the money.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760]   All right.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.880]   Well, I am going to wrap this up because I think we've got all the great news stories
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.880]   and I think you guys are the greatest.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.320]   Thanks for showing up on a Saturday.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.360]   It's not our usual record day, but I'm going to take a little time off on the Twit Network
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.360]   next week.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:52.440]   Hey, I want to mention something and I meant to mention it last week, but our good friends
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:56.200]   at Scott Evester having a big, big, shale.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.400]   You know, we love Scott Evester.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.400]   They do our Twit hat.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:02.800]   In fact, he's having Scott's having a contest on our forums to design more Twits.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:05.920]   They've got a hoodie that they're working on right now.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:10.440]   So if you go to Scott Evest.com, make sure.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.800]   Let me see if I can find some.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.360]   If there's, I think there's a Twit.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:21.920]   I think you can use the word Twit as the promo code because Scott is just Scott is fantastic.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.920]   The secret sale.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:26.760]   Oh, oh, oh, the secret sale is almost over.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.960]   You got till Monday, August 4th.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:33.720]   So it's a, so if you're, if you're listening to this late, I'm sorry, you missed it.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:34.720]   You missed it.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:41.520]   It's too late, but, but if you are hearing this today, the day we do it, the day we are
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:45.920]   hearing it the day before the day we do it, get over to Scott Evest.com and take advantage
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.560]   of the secret sale.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.080]   Do you guys wear Scott Evest stuff?
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.520]   I wear it all the time.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.520]   Big fan.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:56.120]   It's not an advertiser, but I love Scott and I love his stuff and they do make our Twit
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:01.120]   here.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.800]   So Scott scott, S-C-O-T-T-E-V-E-S-T dot com.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:05.240]   Guys, thank you all for being here.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:07.160]   Channel flip is doing great.
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.440]   I'm really proud of you, Will.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.600]   Channel flip.com.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:11.600]   You said you were going to do it.
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.600]   I did.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.520]   I've got a couple of requests to make.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.680]   Can I make a couple of requests?
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.680]   Yes.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:22.520]   So number one, I'm on like 8,856 Twitter followers.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.520]   Can I get it?
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.520]   It's 9,000.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.520]   I think you can get there.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520]   And even though.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.120]   Before the show is over, I think you should just mention that.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.800]   So what is your hat?
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.800]   At Will's heart.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:36.560]   W-I-L-1-L-H-A-R-R-I-S.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.680]   Follow them on Twitter if you're not following them.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.120]   Go there right now.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.120]   My second request.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.840]   This is going right.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.840]   Sing in?
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:45.840]   Is that right?
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.240]   This podcast is going on Monday.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.400]   Monday, yes.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.760]   So we have three new sections launching on Channel flip on Monday and I really want to find
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.920]   out the feedback from the Twitter army.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.800]   They're not technical.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:03.320]   They're completely out of left field and I'd love to know what people think out of them.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.440]   We've got a snack review section.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.440]   Of course.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.240]   A and agony on section.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:13.680]   We can email in your questions to be answered by some fantastic British girls.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.840]   And agony and it's like a deer abbey kind of thing, right?
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.160]   And then a jelly section where we have lots of funny surreal Monty Python humor videos
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.240]   with jelly in them.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.200]   So I would love to know what people think.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:32.920]   When you say jelly, is that a code, a British kind of code word for something else?
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.680]   No, it's jelly.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:37.920]   The actual, you know, like with fruit in it?
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.920]   Okay.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.880]   It's you have to speak to believe that.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   I think I do.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.120]   So where would that be?
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:50.480]   We're having like a UGC competition where people can send us their own videos of jelly
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.960]   and the best jelly videos will win some prizes.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:53.960]   Fantastic.
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:57.800]   I can't wait channelflip.com.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:01.360]   Is it a social network with user generated video?
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.360]   Green.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.080]   That's exactly it.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:07.040]   We're going green very soon going green channelflip.com.

[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:18.640]   He also has got a great podcast there.
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:19.640]   Digital home podcast.
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.800]   You do that weekly.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.120]   I think I was disconnected.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.120]   Oh, okay.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.120]   I'm wait.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   Yeah, I do it weekly.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.600]   Yeah, it's really great.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:34.120]   We talk about loans.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:39.520]   It's the digital Cnet home podcast and ours, technical and Mashable and the New York Times
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.880]   and everything else.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.560]   It's really great.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.960]   And john cdevorek.org/blog.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:52.520]   You can also, he does that, that no agenda podcast with Mr. Adam Curry.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:58.240]   He's got to tech five cranky geeks, market watch a million things.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.240]   You know, you didn't used to have so many things.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.240]   You make that come.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.600]   Actually, I used to have a lot more.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:03.680]   You used to have a lot of columns.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.760]   But yeah, I don't know.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.680]   I had to go new media because you know, the time has changed.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.920]   Yeah, it's all new media.
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:09.920]   That's really cool.
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:10.920]   That's really great.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:16.240]   And I think if you one last, sorry, one last story, why not?
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:19.960]   Just because someone just, Jason Calicata, just twisted me.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:23.840]   I did you to talk about this on Twitter, the space X launch.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:24.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.200]   Was it Richard Branson?
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.040]   Yeah, pretty cool.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.280]   This is a thread that is this virgins rocket.
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:35.960]   The space X versions of space X entry.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:36.960]   I believe so.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:38.960]   It looks.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:40.760]   If anyone has seen it, space X dot com.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.360]   It looks pretty insane.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:46.760]   When Calicata's back on the show, he'll tell you that he's on the waiting list now.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.640]   He's getting two.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.040]   So while they're fueling one, he'll be able to still launch the other.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.840]   To fly in the other.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840]   Thank you guys.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:57.840]   Another twit.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.840]   This is amazing.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.840]   Is in the can.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.840]   Yeah, I know.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:12.000]   You know, I find it to be offensive that people think that way.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000]   Why don't I do my Indian accent?
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   Do my Indian accent.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.640]   I think this is the number one accent in the world.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:18.640]   It's okay.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.640]   We're all going to be talking like this.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:21.640]   No, no, no, no.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:22.640]   You're talking the wrong way.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:23.640]   You're talking the wrong way.
