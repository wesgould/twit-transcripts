[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.360]   How are you?
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.120]   And did you dress up your bulldogs for Easter?
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.600]   No, no, I did not.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.520]   But we were just hanging out in the pool and having a guitar.

[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.240]   Just came across on Declan McCullough's blog on CNET.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.880]   And just kind of a stunning story.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.600]   The FBI-- I don't know if you've seen this yet--
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.920]   is putting up hyperlinks that are-- it's basically
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.880]   a honeypot.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.360]   Hyperlinks that purport to be illegal videos of miners

[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.080]   And then if you click on them, they
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.480]   raid your house or rest you, put you in jail, try you,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.160]   and throw away the key.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.880]   They're outside right now.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.120]   Well, they'd happen to a guy named Rodrick Vosberg.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.360]   Now here's the problem is that people
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.280]   are using these links to Rickroll, other people.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.400]   You know what Rickrolling is, where you put a--

[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.440]   Never going to run around.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.360]   See, we just--
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.880]   We just--
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.120]   Rickroll at the Twitter.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.920]   It's the first Twitter.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.560]   Rickroll got you, 400 people.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.560]   400.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.000]   Tried 200,000.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.200]   No, I'm just saying in the chat--
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.600]   Just the live ones, yeah, because we're doing this.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.840]   Hey, hey, hey, back on track here.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.360]   Come on.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.400]   So Rickrolling is where you send a link that says,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.240]   oh, look, this is an amazing story about the FBI
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.440]   and what they're doing with links.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.600]   And then when you click the link,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.560]   it goes to a YouTube video of Rick Astley singing.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.000]   Never going to give you up.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.960]   It actually started with other pictures and images
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   and, you know, goatsy and so forth.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.640]   But this is an interesting thing,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.720]   because people apparently are passing around these hyperlinks.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.160]   If you click on it, it doesn't matter
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   if you have any past history.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.440]   If they don't have to show any intent,
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.280]   a doctoral student at Temple University
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.160]   taught history at LaSalle University.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.400]   His name is Roderick Woburg, or Wozberg,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.040]   was rated a year ago.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.680]   He allegedly clicked on this FBI hyperlink.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.080]   They threw him to the ground, handcuffed him.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.640]   He was charged with a violating federal law,
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.680]   which criminalizes attempts.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.840]   It's illegal, do you know, to attempt to download Childporn.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.480]   You don't actually have to successfully do it.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.880]   Just clicking on the link breaks the law.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.120]   The jury found him guilty in November, April 22nd.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.280]   He'll be sentenced up to three to four years in prison,
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.680]   even though he never spent any time in--
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.600]   - I'd like to get more details on this.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   This whole story sounds like bull.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.120]   - Well, I don't know about that.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.480]   I mean, they are definitely setting traps for people.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.720]   I mean, that's pretty well known, right?
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.920]   - Well, furthermore, they had experts testify
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.160]   that he had spent no time in this,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.520]   it was in a forum, a message forum.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.480]   It spent no time there.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.360]   He had not done anything on this ranchy forum.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.720]   - Ranchy.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.400]   - It should be ranchy, but it's actually R-A-N-C-H-I.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.560]   I don't know.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.800]   See, that's to hide it.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.960]   - Wait, I thought you said this was child pornography,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.560]   not bestiality.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.400]   - I don't know what it is.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.240]   I don't know what it is.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.960]   I didn't click on the link, honest.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.520]   - You know, I think a little reporting needs
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.360]   to be done on this.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.120]   Essentially, this is a rumor about a rumor
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.480]   and they'll phone him. - I don't think so.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   - No details on it.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.680]   It's not gonna, this is Declan's did this one thing.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.800]   Come on. - Three Declan's,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.840]   I think he's done quite a bit of due diligence on this.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.520]   - Declan is one of the most hardcore pick up the phone,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.480]   go to do 10 meetings with us.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.640]   - Oh, is that right?
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.760]   Well, that's funny 'cause he wrote a column about me
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.560]   the other day where he never picked up the phone
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.160]   or asked me to clarify anything.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.000]   - What did he say about it?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.840]   - And put a bunch of BS in his article.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.200]   It was ridiculous.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.960]   So I'm not buying that argument.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.240]   Being a member of the media myself
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   and not having been called.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.120]   - What did he say about you?
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.400]   - Yeah, you look it up.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.320]   (laughing)
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.620]   - Wow.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.560]   Well, I had no idea.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.360]   I wouldn't have quoted him had I known.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.120]   He does look like he did a lot of due diligence.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.000]   There's a lot of quotes.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.320]   He talked to a lot of people apparently,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.360]   including professors at George Washington University.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.600]   There were experts saying that there was no evidence
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   that he ever viewed the full size images
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.200]   that the thumbs.db file
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.560]   that the FBI's using a thumbnail as evidence.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   These thumbnails in the thumbs.db file,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.440]   there's no evidence he ever saw the big images.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.960]   They weren't found on the hard drive.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.200]   - Who did that planet to talk to at the FBI?
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.240]   - I don't know, I'll have to find that.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.400]   I'll look through it.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   You don't believe it, in other words.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.040]   You think he's just.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.880]   - No, I'm not saying that.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.440]   I think there's maybe some validity to the story,
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.000]   but I just don't see that this is being followed up enough.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.880]   I mean, no, unless somebody has reviewed
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.080]   the legal documents.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.720]   - Who did he talk to at the FBI?
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.560]   - He's got the FBI after the day.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.240]   - Since he picks up the phone so much.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.880]   - Okay, now this is interesting.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.720]   I don't know.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.880]   I mean, this looks like a very well researched article,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.760]   John, to be honest.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.880]   Let's presume for the sake of argument
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.680]   that the FBI is doing that.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.040]   - And they may well be.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.560]   - Well, nobody denies, in fact, the FBI apparently says,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.840]   yeah, we're doing this hyperlink study.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.680]   - Apparently.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.520]   - He's got a couple of other people quoted in the story.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.440]   I'm going through the story right now.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.920]   And so he definitely has.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.280]   I doubt the-
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.840]   - Hey, I got phone numbers of three or four guys at the FBI.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.600]   They'll be glad to take your call.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.960]   - Anyway, this is, I mean, he's got some of the court documents
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   here explaining what happened, but I mean, I guess the,
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.240]   what we're talking about here is people who would normally
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.400]   not do something deviant can be tricked into doing something
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.720]   deviant can stumble onto something deviant.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.560]   - I agree.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.560]   - I'm not going to argue to the-
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.000]   - By the way, Will's on.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.880]   - Okay.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.360]   - I'm not going to argue that.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.200]   I mean, then there's a lot of situations.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.360]   In fact, I think the more recent one that happened
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.080]   in New York City where they were leaving
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.960]   iPods and wallets lying around and then people would pick,
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.280]   you know, pick one of them up and then they'd be busted
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.120]   for one reason or the-
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.480]   - Oh, daylight, yeah.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.120]   - Because cops are like trying to do, you know,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.520]   they're bored or they can't chase real criminals.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.920]   I'm not sure what the deal is.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   And yeah, there's a lot of situations like that.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.760]   And I think it's abhorrent, minimally,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.680]   except when I see these stories and I don't see a lot of other
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.200]   similar stories, I would like to get a little more information
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.120]   or is it, you know, it seems that somebody should talk
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.400]   to the FBI, that's all.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.640]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.760]   - Joining us right now, Mr. Will Harris from Channel Flap.com
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   who spilled coffee into his-
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.120]   - Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.560]   - Bro, this morning.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.040]   - Yeah, you need a little death march on there.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.200]   What a complete disaster.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.040]   - Brand new?
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.560]   - Dude, no, tell us, take us to the exact thing that happened.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.320]   What size cup was the coffee hot?
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   Was it a full cup?
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.800]   - Don't do that with McCulloch style reporting.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.400]   - So, so I, so, so picture the scene, right?
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.160]   We're at my mother-in-law's, or my future,
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.920]   my mother-in-law's to bees house
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.080]   and Alex is cooking Easter lunch, right?
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.320]   So I figure I'll keep her company,
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.280]   I'll sit in the kitchen and I'll do my video editing work.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.440]   While she's like, you know, chopping up the roast
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.920]   and making potatoes and stuff.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.080]   - So it's Easter in England too?
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.480]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.680]   - That path was in England?
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.440]   - It's Easter all over the world.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.480]   - And so I've got my big cup of coffee
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.600]   that I'm just sitting and I'm eating while I'm drinking,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.120]   while I'm doing my stuff.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.480]   And I just gonna move the cup of coffee
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   and I'm looking at something else as I'm doing it.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.600]   And I spill the cup of coffee.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.240]   So it's a, it's a really big, it's like,
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.560]   it's kind of like a Venti Starbucks cup of coffee, right?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.720]   And it just goes all over the keyboard of this,
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.640]   maybe fall four month old 17 inch MacBook Pro
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.800]   high-res screen four gigs of RAM,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.120]   two and a half gig processor, 300 gig hard drive.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.440]   - Oh, it's milk sugar.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.280]   - Oh sugar, sugar.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.160]   - Thankfully.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.000]   - Just milk sugar.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.640]   - But it had the...
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.360]   - But it stopped operating and that's the thing is you,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.760]   you had power in it and it's probably shorted out.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.000]   - So I very quickly, you know, I tipped it upside down,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.600]   I got all the coffee off the surface, I let it drip,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.680]   I put it in the air and cup but to heat it up.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.840]   - Oh, you know what you need to do?
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.120]   - I did put these keyboards, you put them in the air over it.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.880]   - You put them in the dishwasher.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.200]   (laughing)
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.720]   - If you're listening at home, do not put your MacBook Pro
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.560]   in the dishwasher.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.960]   - Well, what does he get to lose now?
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.880]   - So, immediately, I've made some progress, right?
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.360]   So it turned off completely when I did it.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.080]   I tried it like six hours later and it wouldn't do anything.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.400]   Like you plugged it into the main, did you do anything?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.480]   - You gotta give it days, weeks, months.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.480]   So I really drive it.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.080]   I just tried it five minutes ago.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.200]   And when I plug the MacSafe into the side,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.600]   the MacSafe does now light up.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.960]   - Yeah, I'm telling you, you're just impatient.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.360]   I did this once I dropped my cell phone in the toilet.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.280]   - Yeah.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.840]   - That happens all the time.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.240]   - You don't want the details on this one.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.560]   - It happens all the time.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.640]   - How for you?
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.320]   How many times did you drop the cell phone in the toilet?
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.240]   - Has it never happened to you, John?
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.320]   Are you kidding?
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.080]   You never once have dropped a cell phone in the toilet?
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.960]   - No. - It was so funny.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.320]   I'll never forget the first time I saw this.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.280]   I'm in a men's room and some (beep)
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.880]   is walks in and he's on the phone.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.400]   He's talking really loud.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.720]   Everybody is looking at each other like,
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.280]   "I wanna know, I wanna know."
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.600]   He goes up to the urinal, keeps talking at the urinal
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.640]   and it slips out of his hand and falls in the urinal.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.600]   And everybody is howling 'cause this guy,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.560]   God has come up and said, "He's looking at it.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.920]   He's going, "Do I get it?
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.760]   Do I not?
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.600]   What do I do?
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.440]   What do I do?"
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.200]   And he's like frozen and indecision.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.400]   See, in my case,
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.320]   - Is he still peeing though?
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.280]   - I think he probably was.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   I mean, can you stop on a dime?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.240]   - You know, what exactly happened before it fell in?
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.280]   - He was using the facility.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.120]   - Oh.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.240]   - In my case, the facility had not been used
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.720]   when it tumbled into the bowl.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.560]   - That's something.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.840]   - So I whipped it out. - But write it.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.680]   - I whipped it out.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.080]   First thing you do is you pop the battery.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.120]   - You whipped it out?
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.080]   - Well, no, I took the phone out of the door.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.400]   - Oh, no, I see, I'm sorry.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.960]   I'm misheard.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.400]   (laughing)
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.080]   - This show, I tell you, I don't know
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.000]   what I want to do with you, boys.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.680]   So I took it out.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.520]   I mean, I removed the cell phone from the toilet,
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.440]   removed the battery immediately, right?
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.600]   Well, immediately, you got to get all power off of it.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.440]   - Yeah.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.520]   - I let it dry for literally a week or two.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.840]   The problem is, you know, in cell phones now,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.760]   they have a little test strip that turns pink
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.000]   if it gets wet, 'cause what's been happening
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   is people do this, they bring it in.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.360]   They say, "Well, I don't know, it stopped working."
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.560]   - Oh, it stopped working.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.000]   - Oh, I thought that pink thing was to see
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.360]   if you were pregnant.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.840]   (laughing)
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.760]   - It's the same technology, actually.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.360]   No, it's not.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.200]   So--
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   - That is in no way.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   - No, it's not.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.960]   - I had a little plus sign on it.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.800]   I don't know what--
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   - You could have let that one slide.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.560]   You could have said it was the same technology,
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.840]   it would have gone into the public domain
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.640]   and that would have been become a meme or something.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   - No, it would have been Wikipedia by tomorrow.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.200]   - I don't want to drop the iPhone in the toilet.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.920]   I'm not mistaken.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.120]   - iPhone in the toilet would be bad,
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.760]   but if you let these things dry generally, it's okay,
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.240]   but you gotta give them more time than you think.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.600]   But as I said, I did with the keyboard,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   I literally do put my keyboards in the dishwasher
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.440]   and that works fine.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.480]   - Well, I'm hoping in a, you know,
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.800]   I'll give it a day or so, maybe a couple days.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.480]   - No, no, no, a week, Will, a week.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.480]   - Week, week.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.520]   - I see, what a week could you put a day back?
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.360]   - You gotta shake it.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.600]   - Take the hard disk out.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.080]   - Take it, open it up as much as you can, shake it
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.280]   so that all the drops of water get dispersed
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.040]   and then every day turn it another direction,
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.280]   shake it hard.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.760]   I'm not kidding, this stuff works.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.600]   - Well, it works for me.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.080]   - And then do that with, and when you're done,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.400]   do that with the laptop too.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.240]   (laughing)
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.680]   - Oh no!
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.040]   - John's in an Easter move.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.880]   - Something else.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.280]   - It's a really good excuse to buy that MacBook Air
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   or if you've been lusting after.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   - Do you have any insurance?
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.360]   I mean, what happens now?
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.200]   - I mean.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.680]   - Yeah, it's insured on my home insurance,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.200]   so I'll send it back to them.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.440]   I expect you to get a replacement.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.960]   - If you had Apple Carrot with that protected,
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.320]   - No, not a good one.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.880]   - Apple Carrot's any extended warranty,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.480]   it doesn't cover accidental damage.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.440]   And actually, the number of things that Apple Carrot
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.400]   doesn't cover, even though it's supposed
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.560]   to be an extended warranty,
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.000]   you're usually far better off taking off
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.040]   like third party home insurance cover.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.960]   - Thank you for saying that,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.440]   because I've been saying that for ages and ages.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.240]   - Almost, almost always, because the number of,
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.520]   like, get out clauses that are in the Apple Car
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.200]   are far more than in your average insurance policy.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.640]   - So I have, so it's pretty good.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.000]   - So when you joined us, Will,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.040]   John was saying what a lousy reporter,
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.520]   Decla McCulloch, is, which you can't.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.760]   - No, I didn't say that.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.960]   - I said that, I said that, I said that.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.800]   - I said that, I said that.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.480]   - I said that the story's a little bit sketchy,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.000]   and no matter how these people,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.920]   you've just got quoted,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.560]   I'm just not buying the story at all,
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.160]   because in fact, if the FBI was doing all this,
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.320]   how come there's not like thousands of people lined up?
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.080]   I mean, come on, there's people aimlessly clicking
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.720]   on weird stuff all the time.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.800]   And the first thing, I'm surprised you talk about
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.520]   those people getting somebody to click.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.240]   You know, what you do is you take that link
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.280]   and then you post it someplace with some other attribution,
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.880]   like, wow, this New York Times front page news
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.760]   is really interesting.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.920]   And then they click on it,
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.120]   they end up clicking on the child porn site in the end.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.120]   And according to this story,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.040]   they have to be eyes busting down the door.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.240]   The whole story is sketchy.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.400]   - I believe it.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.880]   (laughing)
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.080]   - I believe it.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.920]   - Okay.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.240]   - I believe that settles that.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.400]   - You're a believer.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.560]   - You're a buyer.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.520]   - I buy it.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.480]   I think they're doing that.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   - No, they're clearly doing it,
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.080]   because they have all the court documents here,
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.640]   and this is like going to trial and something like that.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.480]   So what are we saying?
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.320]   We don't buy what that--
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.160]   - He went to trial.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.360]   He was convicted.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.200]   - Yeah.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.960]   - Well, John doesn't buy that they're doing the hyperlink sting.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.480]   - Here's the, from the court affidavit,
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.040]   on October 25th, 2006,
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.840]   looters in an undercover capacity
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.320]   logged into the ranchy message board
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.400]   and creating a posting that advertised a video
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.680]   of a four year old female engaging in sexual activity
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.800]   with an adult male.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   I won't read you what it said,
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.040]   it was pretty appalling.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.760]   And the posting directed individuals
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.000]   to go to these website links to download the video.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.640]   The preview was at uploader.sights.net
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.680]   and then the full 25 megs and they have four links.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.760]   He clicked a link.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.880]   All of these links go to--
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.640]   - Are you reading from the court document
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.360]   that says he clicked a link?
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.440]   - No, no, I didn't get to that part.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:52.280]   And then, you know, I haven't seen the rest of this,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.760]   but this is from the FDA. - There we go again.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.560]   Well, I'm reading it on the page.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.280]   There must be true.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.640]   And then, apparently, it's hosted by knowip.com,
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.120]   which is dynamic domain hosting,
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.360]   which goes right to an FBI server.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.520]   They record the IP address.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.240]   Now, analysis of the access log.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.120]   This is again, back to the court affidavit from the FBI.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.720]   He's got, you know, the images in here.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.880]   You think he's faking these images?
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.600]   Well, now, here's the way the story reads.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.160]   It's like the FBI's faking the links.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.600]   So how are these images showing up in the first place?
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.480]   Since these links, apparently, don't go anywhere,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.240]   except they make you look like you were trying to do something.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.560]   - I did not.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.640]   The crime is in trying.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.480]   That's what we set up.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.640]   - Well, but I understand that story.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.320]   The crime isn't trying, but meanwhile,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.800]   we're seeing evidence here that there was more than trying.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.400]   Someone had accomplished this,
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.560]   which doesn't make any sense in the context of this story.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.560]   The only thing they found on his computer
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   was a thumbs.db file.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.400]   - Hmm.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.480]   - A thumbnail.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.960]   - Yeah, that's from serious software.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.200]   - Well, no, Windows does it.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.720]   It's just, you know, it makes a,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.280]   if you have an images folder, it makes a thumbnail database.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.120]   - I'm sorry, go on.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.920]   - Yeah, thumbnail database.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.640]   And they looked at the thumbnails,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.520]   and in fact, there are these grainy icons.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.960]   Now, that's a good question.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.960]   Did those thumbnail images come from the FBI?
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.840]   - No, man.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.000]   - It also has to look like entrapment to me.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.560]   - It's, and this is really the larger point here is
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.040]   that the entrapment laws,
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.360]   this is Harvey Silvergate.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.040]   This is also from the Poorly Research article
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.800]   by Declan McCullough, a longtime criminal defense lawyer
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.240]   and Cambridge, an author of a forthcoming book
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.880]   on the Justice Department said,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.520]   "Because the courts have been so narrow
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.120]   "in their definition of entrapment and so expansive
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.280]   "in their definition of probable cause,
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.160]   "there's nothing to stop the feds from acting as
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.840]   "you, Declan, posit."
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.360]   - It feels like minority report, right?
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.640]   Like, so if somebody ever thought about doing this,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.840]   like-- - Pre-crime, pre-crime, yeah.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.200]   - Getting to pre-cogs, yeah.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.040]   I mean, it's like, you thought you were gonna do something.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.760]   I mean, what if somebody like saw the link
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.280]   and was like, I wonder if that really is that, you know?
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.120]   Like, it would never have thought in their whole life
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.000]   to do it, but because they're presented with it,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.840]   they're like, I wonder if that's fake or not, you know?
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.520]   - Same thing if you see an iPod on the ground
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.400]   and you pick it up.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.880]   - I would always return it if I could or tried to,
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.320]   but I don't know it.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.880]   - Do those date line things that Chris Hanson does,
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.120]   do they make you queasy at all?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.960]   - Oh, totally.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.200]   Now, I mean, not the one with the people
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.320]   who they're entrapping who are--
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.440]   - No, actually, that much--
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.040]   - Those ones where they are entrapping people
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.760]   are even, it's just as creepy as anything.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.680]   And I'll tell you one of the reasons,
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.280]   I remember, I watched it a couple of times,
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.760]   I kind of got sick of it because it's handsome.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.600]   - So arrogant.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.440]   - He's annoying.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.000]   - They caught the same guy twice once.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.320]   The guy wanted to be on TV.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.520]   - See, that's a bad, that's what,
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.440]   one of the things that bugs me is,
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.160]   I saw it for the first time in just a couple of weeks ago
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.360]   on MSNBC, 'cause you know, MSNBC,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.960]   when they're done with politics,
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.440]   they go right in the gutter.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.160]   I mean, like, immediately, it's like,
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.800]   Obama, Obama, Obama, prison.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.480]   - I know, whatever you think of like,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.520]   their methods, whatever, I mean,
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.440]   these are people who are like out there
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.880]   trying to find young kids that's--
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.440]   - Well, it's true, they have a chat room.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.520]   - Yeah, I agree with that,
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.720]   but have you looked at these people,
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.520]   they got cross-eyed, many of them have IQs of 80.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.600]   - They must have pretty low IQs.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.920]   - And who knows what the heck's going to do.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.440]   And they believe anything, I mean, it's just like, yeah,
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.960]   maybe they should be thrown in jail for being idiots.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.680]   - Well, you know, this is the thing that gets me,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.600]   you know, okay, so what happens is they go in,
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.760]   Chris Hanson like pretends to interrogate them,
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.040]   they get on, they see there's camera crews,
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.120]   there's lights, Chris has got blowed right here
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.120]   and makeup on, they talk to him,
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.560]   and then they go out the door,
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.640]   and they're thrown to the ground by the police
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   who've been waiting for them to leave.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.200]   And you know, at some point, the NBC producer
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.680]   has to go up to them and say, would you sign this release
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.120]   and allow us to put this on TV?
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.520]   - All right, yeah.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.000]   - That's what they will be, if they don't wanna be blurred out,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.280]   but you guys heard about the person who had this happen,
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.520]   they got home or something, and then they killed themselves.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.360]   - Oh geez.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.640]   - No, no, no, no, no, that, yeah.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.440]   - That a separate instance?
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.840]   - No, no, no, no, let me, that story,
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.720]   which was the controversial one,
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.920]   which is the guy never got home afterwards
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.560]   and killed himself, he never left the house.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.120]   And so they tried to lure him out of his own home
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.480]   because he had talked to somebody in a chat room,
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.120]   and then they couldn't get him to leave,
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   and they tried everything they could,
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.920]   and so the cops came over to his house,
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.760]   he never went anywhere at all,
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.360]   and then he was so freaked out, he killed himself,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.800]   and now there's a big lawsuit about it.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.120]   The guy had never intended to do anything,
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.040]   he was just a big talker or whatever.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.720]   - Well, and that's similar to this story
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.960]   where you click on a link.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   I mean, are you doing something
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.280]   when you're clicking on a link?
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   - Well, I mean, it's obviously,
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.080]   I mean, I know what their argument is,
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.760]   but the point is, is it seems to me that they're just,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.600]   I mean, you could probably get,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.360]   I mean, there's this kind of opportunity,
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   this is like a scam, this is like what con men do.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.960]   I mean, most people are honest,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.800]   but if they're presented by, in fact,
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   I challenge anybody out there.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.120]   You have a con man, a professional con man, targets you,
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.120]   this is like being targeted by a professional assassin.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.320]   You're gonna get conned,
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.240]   and most cons are based on some sort of,
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.720]   you have to be kind of sketchy about how you see
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.240]   what's legal and what's illegal.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.800]   But you're gonna get conned if somebody targets,
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.760]   and conned you, and when the government is out conning people,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.440]   oh, click on this and you're gonna see whatever,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.680]   this is a con.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.320]   When did our own government,
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.520]   instead of protecting the public,
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.320]   start conning the public?
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.160]   It's unbelievable to me that they do this.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.320]   Go do real crime fighting,
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.440]   find people who are doing this stuff on their own,
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.520]   that are actually into it, and arrest them.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.200]   Don't try to trick some idiot with an IQ of 85
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.440]   and to clicking on something.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.960]   Some people can't resist clicking on everything.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.760]   - That's an compelling argument from John.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.480]   - I'm buying it.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.920]   - Yeah, I'm buying it.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.120]   - Are there real criminals out there?
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.480]   I mean, if we, if you--
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.720]   - Well, but there's 10 possible crimes
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.480]   and you run every single person in the United States
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.440]   against the 10 possible crimes,
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.560]   what percentage are gonna go after,
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.800]   take a Trump opportunity?
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.640]   I don't know that it's not right, but--
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.760]   - I guess the argument you'd make is that these predators
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.880]   are kind of operating kind of out of them.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.720]   - That's a little different out of the light of the day,
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.280]   and so you kind of have to go where they are.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.720]   - You know, I'm only taking that so far, buying that so far.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.320]   There's a group called Nambla,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.320]   the National Association of Man, Boy, Love,
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.680]   or something like that.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.720]   Anyway, Nambla has open meetings in the libraries,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.600]   like they had one in San Francisco some years ago,
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.920]   it's kind of scandalous.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.920]   These people are not that hard to find,
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.120]   and they crack these porn rings constantly.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.440]   Those are what they should be concentrating their efforts on,
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.400]   not trying to create more people in the porn,
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.160]   that probably are just, you know,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.400]   they're not really into it,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.320]   they're being conned to be into it.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   I don't, I'm not buying any of it.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.280]   - Well, that's the end, that's the point of,
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.560]   why entrapment is illegal, I agree with you.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.640]   But you know, if we let them go, the terrorists win,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.760]   and I think that's the real problem.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.800]   - It always, that's what I actually was really all about.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.040]   - Yeah, it's all about fighting.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.520]   - But it's not, it's the same to that.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.200]   - It don't cause that, that's 3am cool, doesn't it?
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.120]   That's what it's all about.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.200]   - So I'm not actually, but I'm still maintaining my position
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.640]   that I think the story is not complete,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.200]   and we don't know what's really going on,
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.480]   because I just don't see.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.000]   - If you don't read it in the Times, you don't buy it.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.960]   - Well, there's a little bit of element to that,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.720]   but it seems to me that would be more people complaining
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.120]   than this one or two guys.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.200]   I mean, whether they just target these guys
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.640]   for some reason, I suspect there's missing information.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.200]   That's all I'm saying, that's all I got on there.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.800]   - I have to say, one thing you're absolutely right about
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.440]   is that this, for three years we've been doing this show,
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.080]   we've kind of always assumed,
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.680]   I mean, we're not doing reporting here,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.960]   we're doing an analysis of existing reporting,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.640]   we've always kind of assumed that you could trust these stories,
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.160]   and we work from that point.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.440]   But I think increasingly, because of the huge amount
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.560]   of blogging and news sources out there,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.720]   putting pressure on, previously legitimate news sources
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.640]   like CNET, there maybe is a little bit more vetting
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.640]   we need to do on stories.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.120]   You might be right there on that, John.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.160]   I mean, it may be that there's a lot of pressure
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.640]   to jump on these things quickly before the blog does.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.480]   Blog is for you.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   - Well, yeah, especially when it's anti-government.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.400]   - Yeah, and I think the trend these days
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.600]   is quick rather than right.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.440]   - Exactly.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.000]   - But what, a marvelous, do you guys watch The Wire?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   - Love The Wire.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.840]   - That's the best.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.000]   So in one of the latest season,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.560]   they've got a running newsroom
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.360]   and there's a story or centers around a paper.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.560]   And the guy that's charged,
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.520]   you have like spoiler alert now?
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.680]   - No, spoiler alert.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.520]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.360]   There's no spoiler alert.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.200]   - What episode is this?
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   What series is this?
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.040]   - It's season five.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.840]   - It's season five that's already been shown
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.200]   and I'm not gonna say anything rather than it.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.480]   - No, I have it on my laptop,
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.800]   so I don't wanna, I haven't seen it.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.880]   - The guy, the guy just said it.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.960]   - You're gonna ruin it for,
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.760]   there's a bit of, well,
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.280]   there's a bit of humor there that you're gonna have to know.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.520]   You shouldn't probably talk about it.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.480]   If you haven't seen the ending of the show,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.320]   there's a couple of--
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.120]   - Is this a season closer?
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   - Yeah, it's a season closer.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.040]   It's actually, it's an hour and a half.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.520]   It's kind of a short movie and it's quite funny.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.200]   - What I was gonna say was that in the paper desk,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.400]   they have this one guy and he sends a guy off on a report
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.520]   and he says, you know what,
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.120]   just take two weeks to go and work up this story.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:23.960]   - Never have.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.560]   - Just go and work on the story, spend two weeks writing it
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.400]   and come back with a feature for us.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.880]   And you just think, who in the blogosphere
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.320]   is spending two weeks writing and researching a story?
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.400]   Who in the news businesses are nowadays?
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.920]   - I'm sure the papers like The Times still do that, right?
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.240]   - We've gone from the point where these big mainstream
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.920]   operations could fund that kind of mass in depth.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.840]   Every quote is fact checked and every--
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.680]   - I'll give you an exam.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.640]   - Everything is counted and it's massively researched.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.160]   Tonight where, if you're working on a news desk
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.120]   and we're like seeing it or something,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.520]   you've pretty good a crank out to all three stories a day
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.760]   just to earn your keep.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.120]   - However, however, what happens is if you look at
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.280]   each of those stories as part of the research,
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.160]   each of those as an atom, as opposed to a full story,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.080]   what you have to do is you change your news story,
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.280]   your news digestion process from eating one big, huge,
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.280]   entree to eating a lot of hors d'oeuvres
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.120]   and a lot of little pieces and then you get full
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.320]   from a bunch of different stories and the stories told
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.960]   sort of in real time across the blogs, across podcasts.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.640]   - And is that a good thing?
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.600]   - I think it's better because everybody gets involved in it.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.760]   You just have to change your expectation.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.760]   The story about the guy killing himself in the daylight.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.680]   You hear about it immediately.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.080]   And CNN had the same impact on things.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.800]   People would hear like, oh my God, something just happened
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.600]   on CNN and they would report it totally wrong.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.800]   And for a couple of years everybody said,
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.480]   oh my God, you can't trust CNN.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.600]   And then they realized, oh, live television,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.640]   you have a different expectation of trust.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.000]   You have to be open-minded.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.440]   But when the World Trade Center happened,
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.400]   they thought it was an accident for the first 15 minutes.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.960]   The second plane hit and they still thought it was an accident
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.520]   and they were saying on CNN, like, oh my God,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.360]   this is really crazy.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.560]   Well, it's a chance of two planes
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.520]   hitting the World Trade Center.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.280]   - So you think as a consumer of news now,
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.600]   what we should do is reserve judgment
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.080]   until we kind of get a critical mass of information
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.800]   that means it must be true?
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.640]   - Yeah.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.600]   - And you understand that you may never reach the truth.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.960]   I mean, Jimmy Hoffa, what exactly happened?
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.760]   You know, John Kennedy, what exactly happened?
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.640]   I mean, we're never gonna know.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.160]   And so there's some cases that may stay open for decades.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.000]   - Right.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.320]   So I'll give you an example that's from this week's
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.560]   torrent ripped from this week's headlines.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:39.600]   Engadget reported, your former property, Jason,
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.160]   reported on March 21st, two days ago,
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.600]   that Sony was going to charge customers $50
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   to remove the crap where they were gonna call it fresh start.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.840]   And actually, according to Ken Fisher running
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.920]   in ours, Technica, Michael Dell said,
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.880]   and a couple of years ago, that this junk,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.280]   this trial where this basically advertising
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   that comes on your new PC makes Dell about $60 a machine.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.280]   So you could see with Razer thin margins,
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.520]   why somebody like Dell or Sony or HP,
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.360]   which is notorious for this, would load these puppies up.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.400]   'Cause that's big bucks for them.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.000]   So Engadget said, "Sony's gonna do it.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.400]   They're gonna have this fresh start program,
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.920]   but it'll charge you $50."
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.200]   The blogosphere goes crazy, just goes bonkers.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.880]   Finally, some reporting is done.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.440]   Ed Bott, our good friend, John, talks to Sony.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.480]   Sony said, "No, you know what?
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.000]   That should never have gotten out.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.400]   It was an internal miscommunication.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.880]   We never intended to do that.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.960]   We're gonna have fresh start as a no charge option
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.640]   on some laptops, not on all,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.760]   and we're not gonna charge on that."
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.920]   Spin.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.760]   You think?
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.600]   Yeah, of course.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.280]   Then you could, yeah, exactly, that comes back.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.360]   Even though that looks like, you know,
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.920]   dodgy reporting, the actual farmer likely think
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   there is Jason says.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.760]   True story.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.600]   The plans got out now, the blogosphere's gone mental,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.160]   consumer reaction's been terrible to,
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.080]   oh no, of course we never meant to do that.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.920]   Yeah, but come on, Sony cable of reacting in 24 hours,
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.880]   look how long it took them to solve the root kick issue.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.760]   Maybe they've learned a lesson?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.120]   No, I think you're right.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.840]   They probably haven't, you know, they don't move fast.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.720]   Unless there's somebody in there, you know,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.240]   maybe after the rootkit fiasco,
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.520]   they hired one of those PR firms
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.040]   that specializes in disaster recovery.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.840]   They give you a little bit of insight into this,
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.720]   having been on the person hand
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.440]   at all the legal issues for Engadget,
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.480]   which there were a half dozen a month, conservatively.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.880]   Here's what would happen.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.840]   People would, within the company,
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.440]   not agree with their decision.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.240]   They would be friends with Peter Rojas
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.760]   and Ryan Block at Engadget.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.720]   They would instant message call, whatever,
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.560]   see them for drinks and say,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.820]   here's what's happening inside of Dell or, you know,
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.240]   Palm or whatever company has Apple.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.240]   All these people were friends with the Engadget staff
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.080]   and they would disagree with the decision
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.720]   so they would use Engadget as a tool
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.160]   to make their point internally.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.040]   And so people who are very pro-consumer
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.680]   then looked at, and that was one of the secrets
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.400]   of why Engadget broke so many stories
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.480]   is because they became very inside of friends
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.640]   with those people.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.880]   And we had many occasions where, you know,
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.960]   like for example, the people from Razer,
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.560]   who makes the Razer, is that Motorola?
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.560]   - Motorola. - Yeah.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.240]   - Yeah, so this is the best story ever.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.320]   Motorola emails us a lawsuit,
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   you cannot call the new Razer with the keyboard,
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.400]   the Razer Berry.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.080]   (laughing)
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.880]   And I'm like, okay, you're suing us
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.560]   we're using the term Razer Berry, interesting.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.440]   So I call up the attorney on the phone
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.280]   and I said, hey, how you doing?
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.380]   It's Jason from Engadget.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.400]   Oh yeah, hi.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.640]   And I said, you're a second year, third year associate
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.240]   I see from your profile, she's like,
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.520]   what does that have to do with anything?
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.760]   I'm like, okay, let me explain something to you.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.600]   When we were at your booth at CES,
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.840]   your people were calling it the Razer Berry.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.400]   Number one, number two,
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.840]   so you can sue your own employees.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.280]   Number two, I don't know if you've learned anything
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.200]   about the First Amendment or anything like that,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.720]   we can call any product, whatever we want.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   And you've now basically solidified
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.880]   that the name of this product is--
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.240]   He is the Razer Berry.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.080]   (laughing)
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.920]   Goodbye.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.720]   (laughing)
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.160]   Never heard from him again.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.880]   No, even better, I emailed back,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.160]   I see see the guy who was running Motorola at the time
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.400]   'cause I knew the CEO from like some conferences
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.520]   and I said, hey, thanks a lot for the email.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.080]   Obviously, we discussed this on the phone
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.640]   and it's quite ridiculous.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.280]   But we'd love to interview you,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.480]   as I said to the CEO, we'd love to interview you
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.000]   at some point for Engadget.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.720]   He writes back like, oh, no problem,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.440]   totally would love to do the interview, boom.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.840]   That's how I handled every single legal issue that came up.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.800]   I would CC the CEO of the company
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   and say, hey, let's do an interview about it.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.040]   Interesting.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.440]   But it was always people on the inside.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.280]   Always. Right.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.120]   I mean, when--
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.600]   So how do you though, I mean now, okay,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.360]   now put yourself in Ryan's shoes, that's difficult
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.320]   because you know that you're gonna,
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.920]   you believe this is a true story
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.600]   and you know that you're gonna look bad a day later
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.800]   because people are gonna say no,
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.240]   it's never true, you should never said it.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.400]   I mean, they know how to phrase it.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.520]   They phrase it their sources say this
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.240]   and they know that they're gonna have people deny
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.880]   and all that kind of stuff and you stand by it
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.720]   and I always stood by them and you know,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.240]   basically your reputation over time is what it is
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.560]   and if you look at Engadget's you know,
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.080]   reputation over time, they're right more than they're wrong.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.920]   If they don't--
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.000]   - But don't you think there's a risk among readers
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.960]   that pretty soon readers are gonna say,
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.400]   oh, there goes Engadget half cocked again?
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.360]   - No, no, they don't think that.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.360]   They think the opposite.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.040]   They think when you know,
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.240]   Engadget is gonna report on things early
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.000]   and there's a chance that misinformation will happen
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.040]   but we would get all these fake things emailed
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.600]   and we would sort them out really well.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.120]   It's very hard to trick those guys
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.080]   because they have so many internal people at each company
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.440]   that if somebody sends a fake Apple device,
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.320]   they know 50 people who work in Apple product development
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.920]   they can say fake or not and they go fake.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.720]   - They have been burned though.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.840]   - Yeah, like once or twice and when they got burned
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.520]   it was like burned in air quotes
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.200]   because they said here is the latest rumor.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.480]   - Right, it's not a,
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.040]   I think they've done a marvelous job overall.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.400]   I mean, right from the beginning is as well
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.960]   set up the right way and I agree with Jason.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.840]   The people aren't going to reject,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.520]   oh, those guys, I'm not gonna read them anymore
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.360]   because they've been wrong once or twice.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.840]   Actually, you wanna read and especially if they're doing
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.120]   stuff that is a little like,
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.400]   wow, where they get this information.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.880]   I think it makes people even more likely to read them
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.520]   because it's just what, I mean, you wanna do look--
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.560]   - What's we're looking for, I guess, in a blog, right?
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.440]   In a gadget blog, we're looking for that kind of--
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.320]   - You're looking for rumors and gossip
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.240]   - It's entertaining if nothing else.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.480]   - Yeah, when I met Steve Jobs at the
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.080]   the Wall Street Journal Deconference,
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.880]   he saw him, I had a gadget on my badge
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.080]   and he's like, oh, I love your side,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.720]   da da da, that's great.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.680]   You know Peter Ross and I said,
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.520]   can I ask you a question?
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.640]   Like, why do you read it?
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.280]   And he said to me, competitive intelligence.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.720]   It don't have people for that, he's like,
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.920]   your guys are better.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.000]   (laughs)
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.240]   That way Steve Jobs said that to me.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.440]   - That's nice.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.880]   - I could give you the best
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.480]   and gadget story ever now that I'm a couple years out
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.840]   from it.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.720]   You remember the trio 700 or something?
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.040]   Like, you know, run Windows or something?
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.120]   I may not have all my fans.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.320]   - It was the first Windows mobile,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.720]   the trio for a long time, 'cause it's a Palm company.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.520]   Ran Palm only, the 700W ran Windows Mobile
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.600]   for the first time.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.960]   - So all the speculation comes out about the 700W.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.560]   I'm with Peter, pulls out of his pocket,
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.680]   a trio 700W.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.200]   And I look at that, I go, oh my God.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.000]   I said, this is an out.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.040]   And I said, where did you get it?
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   And then he goes, well, and I said,
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.280]   you know what, don't tell me.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   I didn't see it.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.880]   - I don't want to know.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.320]   - There were three people who had the device,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.640]   Bill Gates, the guys from Trio and Peter Rojas.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   One of the internal guys had given it to him
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.560]   to get his feedback on it.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.160]   - Wow, see that's when you've got some power.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.520]   - That's how insire they were.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.480]   - Now of course, Palm lost a huge loss.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.640]   What was it, $31 million loss speaking of the trio?
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.640]   Because of poor sales on the trio,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   they announced that this week.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.200]   $31 million, $31 million last quarter.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.240]   Is it over for Palm?
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.680]   John, what do you think?
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.520]   - I don't know, you know,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.040]   there's never over till it's over
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   and I had to use that phrase.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.920]   - So they could come back with the killer phone
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.720]   and the transit, turn it around.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.360]   - I'm of the opinion that they're gonna be bought out.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.120]   And I think it's gonna be,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.560]   I'm of the opinion that, well, this is my thinking.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.760]   I think Motorola's gonna buy them.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.040]   - For what?
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.320]   - Not the Palm OS, it's antiquated.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.560]   We haven't seen OS 6,
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.640]   we have no idea what that's gonna be.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.760]   - Well, somebody's gotta buy them.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.120]   - $31 million loss compared with a profit
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.560]   of $11 million a year before.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.400]   Will,
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   - I think the trouble is with Palm now,
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.200]   you think, you know, what do they do
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.360]   that nobody else does better?
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.480]   It used to be, you know, Palm was like the PDA people.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.160]   - It just shows you to be on top of the world,
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.680]   even as recently as last year.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.120]   - And Apple comes along and pulls.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.520]   - As soon as phones and PDA started to converge,
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.160]   you got Windows, mobile devices, okay,
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.320]   we're chunky to start with,
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.400]   but are now actually all right.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.160]   You know, the Razer Berry is not a bad device.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.560]   You know, the whole keyboard market's just been owned
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.880]   by Blackberry.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.400]   And then the whole kind of smart media phone thing
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.920]   is just owned, well, you know, not owned by Apple,
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.120]   but is heading in that direction.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.200]   And so you think like, what has Palm got
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.880]   that nobody else has got?
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.120]   Like, like, what are they?
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.480]   - Unless Garnet is something really special.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.920]   - So, and I mean, do you really want to introduce a new OS
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.080]   again to a system now where, you know, nobody buying a PDA
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.960]   or a smartphone now, for the most part, you know,
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.280]   the general market is familiar with the Palm OS.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.840]   - A cobalt, that's right, not Garnet.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.760]   - Hey, KJ's pointing out in the chatroom, John,
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.560]   that isn't Motorola getting out of the cell phone business?
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.760]   - Well, okay, maybe-- - They dropped their cell.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.600]   So maybe it won't be, maybe it's Nokia.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.760]   - I can't. - No, they got the S60.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.840]   - No, that one worked.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.120]   - I just get the sense that they're a candidate
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.160]   for somebody to buy because they did, it's not, yeah,
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.480]   they're not doing well and that Palm OS is old.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.440]   - You know, I really have to assume they've been working
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.800]   on something in the meantime.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.640]   - You know what really happened, Jerome?
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.480]   - You can't do it. - You can't do it.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.320]   - Love the form factor.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.400]   There's something about the form factor.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.760]   It's sort of-- - I agree with you.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.280]   - I agree with you. - Blackberry.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.600]   - I've always liked that form factor.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.000]   - It's very-- - It's not the right, yeah.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.600]   - It's very 2003.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.400]   - People are still to that item though, you know,
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.880]   like people are still carrying around their Palm, you know?
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.520]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah, but they've been struggling for a while.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   I mean, I haven't used a Palm in years.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.040]   You know what really happened is Carl Rove switched
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.600]   from his trio to an iPhone.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.520]   It was all over then.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.320]   Did you see this? - No.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   - Carl Rove, he's being interviewed by newsbusters.org.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.760]   He says, the interviewer says, "I see you just got an iPhone.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.120]   How's that working out for you?
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.680]   Carl Rove, I love it.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.720]   My life has changed.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.680]   I have a-- (laughing)
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.040]   I have a sh-- - Well it has.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.360]   I have a shred of coolness.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.800]   I've got my 3,500 people in my address book on the phone.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.280]   I can sync my calendar.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.680]   I keep track of my modest little stock investments.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.520]   I could check the weather of my house in Washington,
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.200]   my house in Florida, my boy at school,
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.440]   my Hunt-Lease in South Texas.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.920]   - I could destroy people's careers.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.760]   (laughing)
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.600]   - I could surf the web. - I can surf the web.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   - I'm eight and that's insane.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.440]   - And that's insane. - You know,
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.120]   you know, the other thing?
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.080]   The other thing is that he then doesn't have to integrate
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.640]   with anybody else's email system.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.200]   - Absolutely, his emails need to conveniently lose.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.560]   He's not going to copy his for anybody else to worry about.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.480]   - Good point.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.320]   - That's why.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   - No, no-- - Is he gonna--
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.960]   - Blackberry server.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.240]   - I like the theory.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.360]   - And not only that, he says-- - Bloody--
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.480]   - Not only that, I also have a MacBook Air,
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.280]   which is really cool.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.200]   Even my wife is jealous of my MacBook Air.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.360]   - He says that? - Yes.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.320]   - As you working for the gapple now, what's the deal?
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.400]   - And then the viewer says, well,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.480]   you'll have to get her one, then he says,
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.320]   "No, I don't know.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.720]   I'm the only cool one in the family
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.320]   with a MacBook Air."
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.240]   - Can you have a MacBook Air in jail?
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.720]   - You know what-- - He's in jail.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.400]   - You know, the headline should be for that?
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.280]   - Call Rive.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.720]   - Call Rive refuses to give his wife one.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.320]   - Yeah, let's spin it.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.560]   Carl Rove style.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.640]   - Yeah, I think we should go after Carl Rove
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.240]   and see what we can spin because heaven knows
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.160]   he can't do anything to us.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.520]   - He's harmless now, right?
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.720]   - So-- - There's nothing.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   - That guy got his (beep)
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.600]   check every day in high school.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   - Carl Rove, but he got it back though.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.160]   He got it back and then some.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.720]   Hey, if anybody has a chance when they do these political,
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.280]   you know, they're once well, they have like,
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.040]   there's a, you know, the Pennsylvania election
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.320]   probably have a lot of coverage on the cable stations.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.200]   Watch the cable coverage on Fox News,
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.600]   not, you know, the Fox News that's on cable.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.320]   And because they have a Carl Rove thing,
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.360]   he comes on and he's like an analyst for them
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.600]   and it is absolutely fascinating.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.320]   - Well, he works for Fox now.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.160]   - Yeah, I mean, he's really interesting.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.560]   - What's the fuck Fox before?
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.400]   Are they in the state?
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.080]   - No, they were for him. - Yeah, probably true.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.600]   - But that's not on the same--
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.000]   - No, yeah, because well, I think that's often the case
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.320]   when you get these guys in there unchain
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   and they can talk freely.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.800]   They really, I mean, it's like Jason or like you.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.880]   They have a lot to say, they have a lot of knowledge.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.040]   Now that you're no longer working for the triads,
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.800]   I think we can really hear the true story
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.040]   from John C. de Vorak.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.080]   I don't know.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.520]   - Whatever that is. - Whatever that is.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.480]   New survey from the Computing Technology Industry Association
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.520]   finds John McCain and Barack Obama
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.720]   in a dead heat for the geek vote.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:24.360]   Each with 29%, Hillary 13%, Huckabee 11, Ron Paul,
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.280]   only 9%, which kind of surprises me.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.760]   - Yeah, he was number one for a long time.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.520]   - I thought the geeks loved Ron Paul.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.440]   - These surveys are hard.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.760]   - I know. - Not up to par.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.200]   - I know, but it's interesting.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.000]   Did you know there are 12 million IT workers in the US?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.840]   - That's it?
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.160]   - Yeah, 27, that's it.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.000]   Well, you're right.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.920]   I mean, given all the IT we do, 27% say they've contributed
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   to a presidential campaign on the internet.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.880]   Which kind of, that's impressive.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:02.760]   IT workers who are willing to apply a partisan label
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.360]   are most likely to call themselves Republicans
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.480]   or conservatives, 35% and 36% respectively.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.600]   - Is it not that true?
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.240]   - That's what this says.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.000]   - It seems to me, I mean, call me Ryan Lee Inkner.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.760]   But when I think of IT in America, I think West Coast.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   - You think of it, West Coast, I think.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.320]   - You know, remember, there's a lot of guys.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.160]   - There's a lot of guys.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.880]   - The sushi and Starbucks Democrats.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.720]   - There's a lot more guys.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.200]   - That's not IT, that's high tech dorks,
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.840]   you know, that are in the entrepreneurs maybe.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.480]   But most IT is like everywhere.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.240]   - I mean, they're the other guys in the white,
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.080]   short-sleeved shirts and the little skinny black guys.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.840]   - They're from the whole kept sea, they're there, they're there.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.680]   - Rochester.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.240]   Rochester.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.120]   Let's see.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.560]   - Have you guys seen this website Intrade,
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.760]   iintrade.com?
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.800]   - What is it?
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.360]   - It's a prediction market.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.000]   So you can actually, it's becoming like,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.040]   well, I know all these banker guys
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.680]   who are like spending money on this.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.400]   - They don't get enough of the stock market.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.240]   - Yeah, I know these guys are.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.240]   - It's called Intrade?
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.680]   - Trade, you basically bet on prediction.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.320]   So like right now,
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.640]   - Oh, right, right, I've heard it.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.040]   - But the Democratic presidential nominee
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.080]   is trading at $79.90.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.680]   So you can sell that at 78 or you can buy it at 79.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.440]   Hillary Clinton as Democratic presidential nominee,
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.440]   you can buy it 20, you can sell it at 97.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.280]   - Whoa.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.120]   - Yeah.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.040]   - And then you have a trend.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.120]   The idea here is the wisdom of crowds, right?
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.160]   That the stock market encapsulates a lot of information
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.200]   and accurately reflects that information.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.120]   And why not use the same kind of market to,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.080]   - I know the trouble is you need to--
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.800]   - I'm here you get to bet with money.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.840]   - I'm sticking with Hillary, I just can't see Obama.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.720]   - She's numerically out.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.560]   - No.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.400]   - How could she win?
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.840]   - Memento, the big man.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.680]   - The big man.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.360]   - There's no momentum.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.440]   In order for Hillary to get the nomination.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.600]   - She was perfectly absolutely out.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.200]   She wouldn't still be in this thing.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.120]   - Well, I'm not saying she knows she's out.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.240]   - It's not like McCain who actually has the numbers.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.120]   - You should go and read the,
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.600]   there's a big Politico piece this week
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.360]   that caused a lot of,
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.240]   a lot of sort of fracas online about how,
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.560]   yes, statistically, Hillary is out,
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.760]   but that she's very easily able to play
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.760]   still being in the race
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.520]   'cause it's far more interesting for the media
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.520]   if she is in the race.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.040]   - Well, certainly keeps attention on the Democrats, doesn't it?
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.880]   And even if John McCain is meeting
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.040]   with Iraq and President Sarkozy in France,
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.120]   she's, they still garner them.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   - There is no political analyst in the world
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.280]   that would agree with any of that.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.480]   You wanna decide on your candidate as soon as you cancel,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.120]   they don't start sniping at each other
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.640]   and giving the other side ammunition.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.480]   - That's what's happening.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.720]   - Yeah, but the flip side is that,
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.520]   how much press has John McCain had in the last month?
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.560]   How much has the Democratic Party had?
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.040]   - Is it the good press?
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.440]   - Well, that's the nicest thing is bad press.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.360]   - So Jonathan Alter in Newsweek is right.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.960]   And I'm slowly seeing this idea spread
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.400]   has written that there is no way
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.560]   that Hillary Clinton can garner the nomination.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.520]   In order to do so, she's not gonna have
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.400]   the majority of delegates,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.600]   she's not gonna have the majority of popular votes.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.240]   She would have to sway the super delegates
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.920]   to go against the popular vote
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.800]   and against the delegate vote.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.040]   And at that point,
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.640]   black Americans are gonna stop voting Democratic.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.200]   They're gonna say, we've been disenfranchised,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.600]   let alone the young and the others who are supporting Trump.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.240]   - No, it would actually force her,
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.440]   they'd have to pressure Obama
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.800]   into taking the vice presidency.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.160]   - Well, he's saying he's not gonna do it.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.000]   I think which is a very--
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.480]   - You know, if you talk to any black people,
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.080]   they always say that's where we vote.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.640]   I mean, I've talked to a number of people
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.760]   and they say, you know, we've always been number two.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.160]   We're not gonna take, we know it would be bad.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.960]   My wife came up with an interesting thing though,
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.160]   is if either Obama,
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.600]   I mean, either Hillary beats Obama somehow,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.960]   which would have to be kind of a sleazy way of doing it
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.760]   like it was described,
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.080]   that they will have, we'll have a repeat of those riots
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.640]   that took place in the '60s, the late '60s.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.920]   - I think that's not far off.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.520]   And I think that there are a lot of also young voters
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.960]   for the first time getting involved
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.560]   who are gonna be very disillusioned.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.320]   I think the Democrats do that at their peril.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.800]   - Well, I think Hillary can win the popular vote numerically
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.720]   by, you know, maybe like five delegates,
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.880]   if they have a full recount in Florida and in Michigan,
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.640]   and she wins by over 60%.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.040]   And she wins every other contest.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.800]   - She has to win every contest by 60 to 70% to do that.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.520]   - Why are we in this topic?
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.320]   Why are we waiting till after Pennsylvania
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.520]   where we could beat it to death?
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.880]   Because it's gonna be over-analyzed by then.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.360]   - I'm actually looking at the intray.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.560]   They have a ticker right at the top, which is great.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.480]   They show, you know, the US, are we in a recession?
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.520]   79 bucks up, four bucks.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.120]   This is great, Clinton winning in Pennsylvania, up 80 cents.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.360]   This is just like a real stock market.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.200]   I love this.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.040]   - It's ridiculous.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.720]   - So people put real money into this?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.680]   - Yes, and you can do things like weather.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.040]   You can do the weather.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.240]   And there's actually another--
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.360]   - Weather's dumb.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.200]   Don't do weather.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.040]   - Is it illegal in some way, shape or form?
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.880]   - Yes, it is.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.120]   - Okay, well, that's all I wanted to know.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.960]   - Is it in Trinidad?
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.880]   How are they getting away with it?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.080]   - I don't even know, but there's another one
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.080]   that is selling futures in weather to people.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.760]   You can sell futures in these things
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.040]   to people who are trying to hedge.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.560]   So there is a way to sell the weather right now.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.680]   - Well, you might hedge, if you were buying oil commodities,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.440]   you might hedge the weather just to try
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.760]   to protect your investment, right?
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.680]   - I'm wondering.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.600]   There's a number, by the way, out of the country number,
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.160]   plus 4-4, what country code is that, Will?
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.000]   - England.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:36.840]   - England.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.680]   - Okay, so they're in England.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.360]   - Well, no matter, you could bet on anything in England, right?
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.200]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.040]   - In fact, there was a big--
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.200]   - Gambles and drinkers.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.840]   - There was a big froufera, right,
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.720]   and Britain on Friday about whether the bookies
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.960]   should have to close on Friday.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.800]   - Yeah.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.960]   - 'Cause it's good Friday, and they say,
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.640]   "Nobody else is closing, why should we close?"
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.480]   - Absolutely.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.640]   - Especially they become--
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.480]   - They become--
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.320]   - Country that cares about good Friday,
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.160]   should that extreme.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.000]   - I don't know.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.760]   - The biggest football day of the season,
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.600]   probably.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.800]   - Oh, is that why they didn't want to close now,
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.640]   I understand.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.480]   - Yeah.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.720]   - 'Cause to all four teams in the country
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.320]   are all playing each other today.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.440]   - So, Jason, do you think that anybody's making
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.760]   a living on Intrade?
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.680]   - Ooh, that's an interesting question.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.160]   - In the same way that you could be a day trader in stocks.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.520]   - The Intrators are.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.360]   - To get ons the site.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.200]   - They're making money.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.520]   - Yeah, that's definitely true.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.040]   Well, there's actually another one that's doing just weather,
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.400]   and I forgot the name of it, but I met the CEO
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.920]   because he is a former Google person.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.040]   And it's really interesting.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.360]   He's got people like people who run conferences
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.280]   will do a hedge against a storm or something like that,
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.840]   and they'll pay whatever, $2,000 to protect themselves
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.220]   against $100,000, or people who are ski,
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:51.080]   you know-- - Bombs?
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.200]   - Ski resorts.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.360]   Ski resorts will do that on prediction markets
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.520]   to make sure they don't lose--
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.000]   - That makes sense, that's a way to hedge, yeah.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.960]   I don't remember the name of the weather one,
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.640]   but what happens is you have to click a box that says,
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.120]   "I am doing this to hedge against these issues
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.000]   "of my business and guarantee that you're not doing it
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   "just to bet."
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.240]   You can't just be like, "I'm gonna bet tomorrow
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.680]   "is he gonna make money in the rain."
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.520]   - I wanna make money in the rain.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.560]   - I can see it being sold as insurance.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.800]   - Yeah, that's basically what insurance is gambling.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.440]   - It is in some ways, right?
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.120]   - You're gambling that you're gonna have
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.000]   a catastrophic illness, and they're gambling that you won't.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   - Yeah, I'm gambling.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   - But that's what you are, you're gambling
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   that you're gonna die prematurely.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   - I'm gambling Will's laptop is not coming back.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   - I think that's a safe bet.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   - 50 bucks, two-hundred-day-re-holland.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   - It's on your dishwasher, Will.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   - That prediction market.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   - Like I haven't lost enough money already today.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   - You wanna use a little bit of cascade,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   that's a great detergent, and then you got a little jet dry
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   that you don't want any droplets on the screen,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   it'll sheet it right off, it'll be incredible.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   - I'm giving 100% chance of an audible commercial right now.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   - I think you're very safe bet.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   My, my, you're amazing.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   How much money did you put down on that?
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   That's brilliant.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   - That's a hundred percent.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   That people are gonna go right now, too audible,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   and they're gonna get 21 bringing down the house.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   The inside story of how six MIT students took Vegas
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   for millions, 'cause the movie's coming out,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   and this is an incredible story.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   - Isn't that a great story?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   I love this.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   - Take down the house.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   - Now you play poker, Jason, so you're probably gonna be
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   - I bought you the kind of guy they would have gone.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   - I had $100 last night at a $100 buy-in table.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   - Didn't you swear off poker though, for a while?
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   - Two hours.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   I'm not swearing it off.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Are you kidding me?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   If I had no job right now to play poker 10 hours at that.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   - This is the guy you don't play poker with.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   This is the guy who takes you.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   So what happened at MIT, it was a blackjack club.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   - That was blackjack, and so what they, what?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And the book goes into a lot of detail,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   and I'm not swearing it off.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   - I'm not swearing it off.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   - I'm not swearing it off.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   - And the book goes into a lot of detail, and you gotta go get
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   the audiobook because it's amazing.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   - Oh, I listened to it.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   It was wonderful.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Yeah, highly recommend it.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   So there was kind of an evil mentor, a fagin, if you will.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   - Oh, what the?
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   - Yeah.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   - He would scout MIT students for the ones with the best
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   mathematical abilities.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   - Right, but it's a pretty simple system actually.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   What you do is, if you see a face card, right, you minus one,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   and if you see a regular non-face card, you like, or under
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   a nine or something, you minus one or something.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   And so then you just have to keep one number in your head.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   So you're counting the cards as they come up, and if you get
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   what's called a charge deck, which is a deck that is got a lot
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   of face cards left in it.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   - It's plus a lot.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   - Yeah, so then you're plus five, plus six, and I was talking
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   to a guy who actually did it.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   And he's been on deck, so I had plus 12, plus 15.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Then you go from betting $25 to betting $2,500 a hand.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   - But the key is you do this in a team.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   The guy who's counting never bets, or he makes sucker bets,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   but he somehow has a secret signal that he calls over the guy
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   who's gonna play.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   - Exactly, and it's not illegal to do, but it's not illegal
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   for the casino to--
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   - Throw you out on your ass.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   - You serviced anybody.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   And now you have to count into like five decks.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   - Right, and they shuffle up after about a quarter of the way in.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   - And it takes you a lot of time.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   You might sit there for three or four hours and not get a charge deck.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   You just cost you four hours of your life.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   - But that's why they do the teams, because you don't want to
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   suddenly see somebody's betting pattern change.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   But if somebody stumbles over, maybe he's a little drunk,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and he starts laying down, "I'm gonna buy car pals!"
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   - Yeah, it's a very clever, and they did.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   They took a lot of money.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   It's a great story.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Good choice.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   21 is the name of the book by Ben Mesrick.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   It is available on Audible, on a bridge.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   - No, it's "Breen Down the House" is the name of the book.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   - Yeah, it's the name of the film.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   - They renamed the book so that you would notice it.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   - Uh...
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   - So it's called, now you're right.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   When I read it, it was "Breen Down the House,"
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   but I notice on Audible it now says 21, and on the cover it says
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   21 "Breen Down the House."
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Very good point.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   - It changed the name of the film.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   They should have just called the name of the film,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   "Breen Down the House."
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   - It's a much better name.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   I don't know why they didn't.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   - It sounds like a bad thriller.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   - Yeah, 21.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   - But it was just...
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   - It didn't work.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   - "Breen Down the House" kind of seems like a bad Martin Lawrence comedy.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   - Wait, wait, wait.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   I want to hear Jason do his "In a World" impression.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   - "No world filled with twos and sixes."
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   - Only one man.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   - "And get an ace and a ten."
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   - And that is 21.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   - Only one man can bring down the house.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Actually Kevin Spacey is going to be in that movie,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   my good friend, so that should be good.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   You know what, we'll get Kevin on the show.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   He is a major geek.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   And I didn't know he was going to be in this,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   but apparently he is, so that'll be fun.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   He'll probably be doing the rounds.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   We'll get him on the show.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   That is our prediction.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   An audible commercial.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And Jason, you win the pot.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Very good.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   21 "Bringing Down the House" is our Audible Pick of the Week.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Now, you've got to know about Audible by now.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Audible is the great place to get your audio books.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   Instant downloads.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   Play them on your computer, burn them to a CD.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Play them on many different devices.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   It really is a great way to get your reading done.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   In our busy lifestyle, it's hard to find time to sit down with a book.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   But I would hate to give up reading.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   That's why I love Audible.com.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Twit.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   You can sign up and get a credit for a book.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   Make it this one.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   This will be a great show.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   You're going to love this.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   "Bringing Down the House" is the inside story of six MIT students
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   who took Vegas for millions.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   Correct me if I'm wrong, but you could go do it right now
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   while you're listening to the show.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   You can go off right now and just get it and worry about it later.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Just pick two or three books, get them in your queue,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   and then you have them when you're on the bus,
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   where you're stuck online or you're in your car.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Because that point you're going to wish you had gone to Audible.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   So just go right now and get yourself a couple great books.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Simple enough?
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Simple enough?
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   It's so easy to use, too.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   It's brain dead, Sim.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   So I admire him.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Gavin knows how to pitch.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   He's a pitch man.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   He's a pitch man.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   But the question that comes to mind is,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   "Leo, have you ever thought of reading one of these books?
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   I mean, for Audible or for some company or for a publisher?"
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   I'm going out there to talk with him next month
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   because I'm going to try to pitch them on sponsoring this Twit Live concept I have.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   And I'm going to ask him if I could read a book.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   What do they pay for that, do you know?
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   I don't know.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   I'm going to find out.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   I think it's not a bad living.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   It's probably nothing like what I'm used to, but I think it's not a bad living.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   No, but I just think it would be cool.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   I'm sorry, but I just think it would be cool because I think you have a dramatic
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   voice that it would be really good.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   It's listenable.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   I think somebody could listen for hours to you reading a book.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   I'm going to read it like this.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   We're going to do a next born novel.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   And I'm doing the whole thing like Boris Badenov.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   It'll be great.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   And I'm going to call myself Igor Stravinsky.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   You got to teach me that voice.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   Fantastic.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   You know how I got this voice?
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   I was on a chess cruise.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   You know those geek cruises?
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   They have chess cruises.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   And it was American.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   It was like US champion.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   It talks like this.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   They're all Russian immigrants in the United States.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   And they can't speak English very well.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   They're actually great guys.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   They were doing these lectures.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   But English wasn't very, mostly what they said is no good for black.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   White loose.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   I'm John Devorak.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   You're listening to Moby Dick.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   I like this.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   I'm just going to call me Ishmael.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   I love it.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   I love it.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   I love it.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   I love it.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   I love it.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   I love it.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   I would sail a little more on the worried part of the world.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Was that the Jersey Shore?
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   You know the thing is I don't think I could read a whole...
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   I think this I just would get tired.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   Well it's...
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   I mean sure it's hard work to do it.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Because you know they edit out all the mistakes.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   You can't make mistakes or they fix it I guess.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   And you're sitting in an air-pretite studio for long hours.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   I mean some of these books are 20 hours.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   That would take you weeks I would think.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   But anyway I'll do a short one.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   I'll do like Horton hears a who or something.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Well at least find out what the story is.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Because you know I think...
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   By the way so you immersed yourself to get that Russian accent.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Oh he was a mutagen.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   He is absolutely.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   I would see it with "they made dinner".
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   And it's funny because one of the...
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   There was an American-American champion on the cruise and he didn't like the Russians.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   So the Russians would sit at one table.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   I'm not gonna say any names.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   The Russians would sit at...
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   If you're a chess player you know all these names.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   They would sit at one table and he would sit at another table with his wife.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   And I sat with them once and he said, "Yeah I don't like the Russians.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   They treat service personnel terribly."
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.800]   And I think it really has more to do with the fact that they took over the American
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   chess world by beating everybody.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   Take mint tea with honey.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   Get it now.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   No.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   Camille.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   Lady.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.800]   I got...
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.800]   Bring mint tea with extra honey.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   Bed for black.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.800]   Black loses.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   I want to wait much longer.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.800]   I want to mate in one with you.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   So...
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.800]   Okay.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.800]   Okay.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.800]   We move on now.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   Not harder than getting green tea.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   Let's go.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   Okay.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   I had another story.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.800]   Oh Jeff Bezos.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   You know him.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   Hey.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.800]   I like to say Bezos.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.800]   Hey.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.800]   If you say that...
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.800]   If you say that...
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   If you say that...

[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.800]   If you say that...
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.800]   If you click on 10 links...
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   And three of them...
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.800]   Or FBI porn links...
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.800]   Have to get the seven out of ten right.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.800]   Oh, but the FBI has the best porn man.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.800]   So then...
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.800]   Then what happens is your concierge comes...
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.800]   And puts all your stuff in a tray...
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.800]   And bulldozes her way to the front of the real line.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:40.800]   Hell yes!
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.800]   She says, "Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me..."
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.800]   And you feel like I can't...
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.800]   You're following her, "Excuse me..."
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.800]   And people are giving you the worst looks.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.800]   Yeah, that's the worst.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.800]   I mean, I could feel the daggers in the back.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.800]   I'm sorry, I paid for this.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.800]   I didn't know what it was going to be.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.800]   Oh, that I was going to stick it in your face.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.800]   I thought there'd be a separate line.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   I didn't mean to have to interact with you people.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.800]   Yo, sometimes I'll go and I'll have a business class ticket.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.800]   And there's 50 people online.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.800]   And I don't even go through that shuttle on the side that's business.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.800]   I'm like, "You know what? I'm just going to get in line."
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.800]   Hey, we have thanks to our chatroom, irc.dslxtreme.com.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.800]   Thank you guys.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.800]   They're watching on the You Stream video.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.800]   We have the YouTube version of TSA Blogger Bob.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.800]   Oh, this is going to be good.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   So we can play a little bit of this.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:26.800]   Blogger Bob.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.800]   Bob here from the TSA Evolution Security Blog Team.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:32.800]   We noticed some blog posts the other day about Apple MacBook Airs.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.800]   And it was causing some problems at checkpoints.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.800]   So we decided to get our hands on one.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.800]   And after looking at it, it is much thinner than your typical laptop.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.800]   Thank you, Blogger Bob!
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.800]   But you're also going to notice that it only has three ports.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:46.800]   Thank you, Blogger Bob!
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.800]   You're a big, far-wire user, you're not going to want to stop.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.800]   [laughter]
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.800]   Oh dear.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.800]   I don't think even a lot of notice here is that this is actually aluminum,
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.800]   which is just like the old G4.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:01.800]   [laughter]
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   I don't think that's going to be extra careful with this laptop.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.800]   I'm like the British human steel of the other.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:07.800]   Oh dear.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:08.800]   Oh dear.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.800]   You're going to get in.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.800]   And one thing, you know, one thing for frequent travelers,
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.800]   you can't remove the battery on this one.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.800]   Yeah, just a little break.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.800]   Isn't that you even want to-- if you're watching movies,
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   this may not be the laptop for you because you're going to need
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800]   extra external DVD.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800]   I'd better get that out there.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.800]   My theory was, it's probably going to be laid out differently on the inside
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.800]   than most laptops were custom to sing.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.800]   So we might explain why it gets more scrutiny.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.800]   So we were able to get our hands on one, and we're going to run it to the X-ray
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.800]   and see what we can find out.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   This is a whole new thing.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:34.800]   This would be a great website.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:35.800]   Will it X-ray?
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   Yeah, but he got his hands on one like--
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   Will it X-ray?
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.800]   [laughter]
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.800]   He brought to Steve Jobs people, and he got us one.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.800]   Like, they were on mission and positive.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.800]   We got our hands on one.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:46.800]   Let's try it out right now.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:47.800]   Get Peter Rojas.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.800]   It's Paul, but the TSA, it's going to go through the--
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.800]   No, Bob is standing-- either standing or sitting at the--
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.800]   Peter, Bob, from Engadget?
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   No, we're going to talk about--
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.800]   Blogger Bob.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.800]   99% of the laptop is--
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.800]   See, look very similar.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.800]   But I can tell after looking at the X-ray image of this MacBook Air,
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.800]   I can see some areas that repeat some interest.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.800]   It looks very different than what we're accustomed to saying.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   And layman's terms, this uses a different drive
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800]   than your typical laptop.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.800]   There he goes.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.800]   He's going into the review.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   Let me just tell you, the layman's term for it is drive.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.800]   You may have heard the variation, hard drive.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.800]   [laughter]
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.800]   Actually, what's the variation?
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.800]   It's a hard disk.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.800]   What's he talking about?
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.800]   Well, let's get the solid state, maybe.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.800]   Oh, it's a solid state.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800]   Oh, sorry.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.800]   He won't show the X-ray though, because if he shows the X-ray,
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800]   that's proprietary.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.800]   Can't look at that.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.800]   All right.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.800]   Thank you, Blogger Bob.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.800]   I feel bad for the poor guy.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:40.800]   Hey, you know, years ago when the first of Toshiba had these
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.800]   light machines, they still do.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.800]   They're 2.2 pounds.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.800]   They're lighter than this thing that Apple does,
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.800]   and they're pretty cool.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.800]   And I remember I had the first of one of the R200s, the early ones.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   And if you took the battery, they had an extra battery,
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.800]   but they had a battery built in.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.800]   If you took the battery off, the thing was really incredibly
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.800]   light and thin, it's two, again, two pounds.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.800]   And I remember going through TSA with one of these things brand new,
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:03.800]   and again, the way the guy looks at this, he picks it up,
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.800]   and he says, wow, this laptop's really light.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.800]   And then he just passes it.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   That was it.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   You don't have to take off your shoes, sir.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   You just go right through.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.800]   All right.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.800]   We're going to wrap this up, because it is Easter Sunday,
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.800]   and the sun is shining, and Jason's got a half-eaten hamburger
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:22.800]   and some fingers to dip in some ketchup, and we don't want to
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.800]   keep it from that.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.800]   I could talk about the fact that Gibson is suing the makers of
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.800]   Rock Band and Guitar Hero, because they invented, apparently,
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.800]   the technology to simulate a musical performance.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.800]   Steve Gibson?
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.800]   They created the Air Guitar?
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.800]   Gibson, the guitar maker, says that the guitar controllers for
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:46.800]   Guitar Hero and Rock Band infringe on their technology patent that
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.800]   protects the right to, quote, simulate a musical performance.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.800]   Also known as buttons?
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.800]   I don't know what they're talking about.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.800]   For buttons, I haven't made heads or tails of that either.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800]   I've been trying.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.800]   Every time I see the article, I can't figure out what the real
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.800]   point is, what's the lawsuit about?
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.800]   They didn't come up with the idea.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:05.800]   Actually, that's exactly.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.800]   They had a licensing deal with Rock Band.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.800]   In fact, if you play guitar hero, if you play guitar hero,
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.800]   you can choose from Gibson guitars.
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.800]   They had a licensing deal, which they apparently backed out of,
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.800]   and then decided to sue them, Activision and Harmonics both.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800]   I don't know what's going on there.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.800]   They're trying to get a $10 million settlement is what's trying to go on.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.800]   That's exactly what they want.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.800]   They'll chunk a change.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   Rock Band or Guitar Hero, what are you, Jason?
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.800]   We have both at the office.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.800]   I like a little Rock Band myself because I like playing with the group.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.800]   That's what I like.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.800]   But I couldn't get my kid and my kid said, "No, I want Guitar Hero."
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.800]   How about you, John?
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.800]   What do you play in the Dvorak household?
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.800]   Guitar hero, of course.
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:42.800]   Of course.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.800]   Do they have Guitar Hero in Britain?
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.800]   We play cello champion.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   I'm a fluegle horn fella.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.800]   We have Rotor-Prods made in guitar hero.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   Rotor-Prods, Rock Band doesn't exist here.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.800]   Rock Band?
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.800]   You don't have Rock Band?
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.800]   I have no idea why Rotor-Prods exist.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:00.800]   Rock Band's the greatest.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.800]   I looked at the latest release dates from the UK trade paper,
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.800]   said that Rock Band is coming here in September.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.800]   It is so fantastic.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:13.800]   The thing is that gets me, I can't imagine people spending $250 for a video game, but they do.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.800]   $250 because you have to have the guitar, the microphone, the drums.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.800]   If you get 50 hours or 100 hours out of the game, it's a couple of bucks.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.800]   A lot cheaper than going on the movies.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.800]   It's so much fun.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.800]   Oh, God, it's a party.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.800]   It is, it's a party.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   Yeah, well, that always like the way you-- how cavalier Jason is about spending money.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.800]   I've not spent money money.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.800]   Yeah, I mean, you have to put another deposit down for a quarter of a million dollars for
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.800]   some piece of car that's probably not going to even work for a year.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   I wouldn't need to play that too.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.800]   The Tesla is shipping, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.800]   What?
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.800]   What's talking about the Tesla?
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.800]   What?
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.800]   Are you excited, Jason?
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.800]   When do you get yours now?
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.800]   What number are you?
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:00.800]   The only put numbers on the top 100, so I was after that, but it looks like Q1 next year.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   But you never know.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.800]   I got some inside and hooked.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.800]   Somebody drops out.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   I might be able to move up a list.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.800]   Isn't that thing just a lotus with an electric engine?
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:15.800]   They rebuilt it for-- at 8 million pounds torque.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.800]   Zero to 60 in 4.2 seconds.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.800]   That's kind of nice.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800]   I drove it.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800]   It's fast.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   I showed-- I gave it to our two radio executives a couple of weeks ago talking about new technology.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.800]   One of the things they all want to know is when are they going to be able to listen to the unit in the car because they were dead?
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.800]   And I said, well, actually, you know, they already can if you have one of these cradle points in the EVDO.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:44.800]   But just as a proof of concept, let me show you a video my friend, Jason Calicanis, took of my other friend, Robert Scobel.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.800]   Peeling off in his Tesla.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.800]   This is live streaming video from an EVDO connection and a cradle point.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.800]   So I showed them that video.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:54.800]   They loved it.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.800]   They didn't actually want me to continue with the speech.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.800]   They just wanted to watch you guys drive around in the Tesla.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.800]   Yeah, that was pretty epic.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.800]   It was very cool.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.800]   Well, it doesn't say much about your speech.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.800]   No, that's true.
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.800]   The cradle point is an incredible device.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.800]   It's only like 100 bucks.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   You plug your EVDO card into it.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.800]   And then you have like, I think it's support eight or 16 devices.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800]   It turns it into Wi-Fi.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.800]   Yeah, so I put it up at LAX and I named it Mahalo.com.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   Very smart.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.800]   I kind of have like eight people.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.800]   I was like, oh, my God, this is branding.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.800]   And so then like when I was at this other conference, the SES in New York, I turned it on.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.800]   Boom.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.800]   I had like 16 people using it and they were all like, oh, thanks, Mahalo.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   Wi-Fi courtesy, Mahalo.com.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.800]   Yeah, you can share your stuff.
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.800]   Then another guy came in.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.800]   I like it.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:36.800]   And it's so cool.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.800]   And the cradle point, when so many comes, you can make a land.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.800]   So when you first set it up, it's a landing page with a chat room.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.800]   So people land and they're on a chat room when they open their browser.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.800]   So the guy, all of a sudden, I see the first guy comes in.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.800]   It wasn't called Mahalo at this point.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.800]   And he's like, can anybody use this Wi-Fi network?
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800]   I was like, absolutely, anybody can use it.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.800]   And right now I'm downloading your Gmail.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.800]   And all of a sudden, boom, I just hung up immediately.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.800]   I could probably have like the airport to see if anybody was like, panicking with their laptops.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.800]   But it was just too much space.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.800]   But it's pretty funny.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:09.800]   No, I bought one.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.800]   I just think it's the coolest thing.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:11.800]   It really is a neat device.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.800]   Well, that's what we'll have at the Twit House when people come.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800]   It's pretty chargeable.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.800]   Great.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:21.800]   So I when I had it in New York, we were driving in a car.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.800]   We had a driver for like three or four meetings.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   So I was with my guy, Tyler.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.800]   We both had our laptops out in the car.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.800]   I opened up the cradle point, boom.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.800]   We're driving around in traffic.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.800]   And we got the laptops out doing Wi-Fi.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   I was streaming over the Wi-Fi.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800]   It was pretty awesome.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.800]   Well, I got to go get some peeps because I can't take it anymore.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.800]   But we want to thank everybody for joining us.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.800]   A reminder that, oh, I forgot.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800]   I forgot.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.800]   Actually, I have to do a special Audible ad I think today.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   Oh, fuck it about it.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.800]   There's a Audible.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.800]   It's incredible.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.800]   Audible is amazing.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800]   No, they're doing something very...
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800]   They got it.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   I don't know if I could talk about it yet.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   I'm trying to find a weekend of March 22nd.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.800]   Yes, that's this weekend.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800]   What?
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800]   Audible.com.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   We have a special URL.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.800]   What?
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.800]   Audible is going to give away books.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:11.800]   Audible.com/biglisten on this Thursday.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.800]   So I want you all write this down, okay?
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.800]   What day is that?
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.800]   March 27th.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.800]   Okay.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.800]   Write this down.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800]   The big listen page is not up yet.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.800]   I just... I'm bookmarking.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.800]   I just tried it.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.800]   Bookmark.audible.com/biglisten.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.800]   Free 24 hours of listening.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.800]   New customers only because they couldn't figure out how to do it for existing.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.800]   They will.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.800]   Selected books and details and so forth.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.800]   Let's see here.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.800]   I'll see what the books are.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:38.800]   The big listen.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.800]   This is exciting.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.800]   I'll Twitter this for you guys.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.800]   That'd be nice.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.800]   That'd be great.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.800]   Let's all Twitter this.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:46.800]   Audible.com/biglisten.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.800]   This is an exclusive.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:48.800]   No other...
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.800]   No, it will not be advertised anywhere else I'm told.
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.800]   Except on my Twitter feed.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.800]   Well, that's okay.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.800]   We don't mind that.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.800]   Let's see.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.800]   Unique to an credit card required.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.800]   Download a best selling audiobook.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:05.800]   Free 11 AM March 27th to 11 AM March 28th.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.800]   I presume that's Eastern time.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   New customers only.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800]   And let me see.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   Big name authors.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.800]   Oh, you got Stephen Covey, Seth Godin.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   This Wednesday.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800]   This...
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.800]   Is that Wednesday or Thursday?
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800]   What day is it?
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.800]   Carmack McCarthy, Wayne Dyer, Ian McEwen.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.800]   Some great stuff in here.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.800]   Got to figure out what day it is.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800]   Blood Meridian.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800]   Ooh, that was good.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800]   What's the day?
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.800]   March 27th through March 28th.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:35.800]   So I'm going to give them an extra commercial because I should have mentioned that in our commercial.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.800]   But that's...
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.800]   If you haven't yet, go on to audible.com/twit.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.800]   Do this first and then you get a free book.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:42.800]   And then go to audible.com/twit.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.800]   Okay, so three Audible books.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.800]   Free books.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.800]   Big listen.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   But March 27th/28th.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   Audible.com/biglisten.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   One word.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.800]   No spaces, no dashes.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.800]   You got it.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.800]   I'm going to Twitter it right now because...
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.800]   Twitter it, baby.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.800]   There it is.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.800]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   We're so glad you were here.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   Jason Calicanis, mahalo.com.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.800]   Look for free Wi-Fi wherever Jason goes.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.800]   And how's it going on your giveaway on the Twitter?
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:08.800]   It's going pretty good.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.800]   I think I added like 2800 people.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800]   Wow.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.800]   You know what's interesting though?
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.800]   I'm 1000 behind you and I stayed 1000 behind you.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.800]   And I'm not giving away a MacBook Air.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.800]   Well, I think what's happening is there's just...
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.800]   It's creating so much excitement and like everybody's going to the Twitter haul page now and signing up forever.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.800]   Something's going on on Twitter.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.800]   It's like there's a lot of new users.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   I can't understand why mine keeps going up several hundred a day.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.800]   I'll tell you what it is.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:34.800]   They were having a problem.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.800]   I don't know if you noticed this, but when you would hit the like you would sign up to watch somebody or follow them.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.800]   I don't know if you ever had it not work and it sort of timed out.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.800]   I think because of all their server issues it was timing it for like a month.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:46.800]   And then...
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.800]   That's why that sudden jump for everybody.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.800]   Now everybody's adding all those people that were backed up.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.800]   So I'm glad we couldn't go to the show, the entire show without...
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.800]   Gammering about Twitter.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   But Jason, listen what Jason's doing.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.800]   He's giving away a MacBook Air.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:01.800]   Yeah, great.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:02.800]   It's thin, you know.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.800]   Give away a Tesla, Jason, and I'm going to go to Twitter.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.800]   I'm working on that.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   I am working on that.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   So what are the...
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.800]   How is your contest work?
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:10.800]   All right.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.800]   Here's the idea.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.800]   I had 10,000 people.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.800]   I said I want to be scoble and I want to be Barack Obama.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.800]   So if I get to 20,000 people and number one, I'll give away this MacBook Air.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.800]   Oh, and number one?
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   Has to be number one, has to be 20,000.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   Oh, well this is a...
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.800]   I don't know if this is a legal contest.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.800]   Thanks a lot, Mr. Attorney General.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:29.800]   Of course it's legal.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.800]   Why don't you send me a Rickroll, you know?
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:32.800]   Let's ask Blogger Bob.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.800]   I'm just saying, I'm just trying to protect it from yourself.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.800]   I appreciate that.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.800]   I'm going to get a lawyer to make a page and I told everybody it's all, you know, contingent
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.800]   on me getting a lawyer to make it all work.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   But I got that paperwork going and we'll make it an official contest.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   But anyway...
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   Because Barack has 17,800.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   You, at this point, have 12,804.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.800]   Well, we'll get it done.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.800]   And so it will be...
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.800]   So you're 5,000 behind.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.800]   You've not only got to get to 20,000, but you've got to do it before Barack Obama.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.800]   Well, I'll extend it then.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.800]   Whatever.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.800]   Whenever I get to number one, we'll do it.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800]   Scoble is 14,765.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   These are people following.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   So every time Barack puts out a Twitter or Scoble puts out a Twitter or Jason puts out
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.800]   a Twitter, Jason puts out a Twitter, 12,000 people get it.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.800]   12,800 people get it.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.800]   That's right.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.800]   And so anyway, here's the point.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.800]   If I get to the top spot, then I'll give it away to one of the 20,000.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.800]   So you don't have to be the new 20,000.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:24.800]   You can be the old.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.800]   But we're going to have some sort of a thing where you're going to get alerted and you
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.800]   have like an hour to get back to me so that you have to be actually following me.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.800]   Oh, you must be following to win.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:35.800]   Right, exactly.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:36.800]   And so here's the thing.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.800]   If you think about it like building a mailing list, right?
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.800]   Building a mailing list of like really high-tech people...
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:42.800]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.800]   ... cost 75 cents a dollar each.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.800]   I'm building it for 17 cents each.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.800]   And you're going to have a 20,000 person list.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.800]   20,000 on my list.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.800]   And once you get to know me, you love me.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.800]   Oh, it's great.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.800]   No way it's going.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.800]   It's something you can get five years to 15 to when you're a...
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.800]   You know, it'll be much more interesting when you start Twittering their prison.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.800]   I think that's going to be great.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.800]   That's a prison.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.800]   Today, butch called me silly.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.800]   It's illegal lottery.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.800]   I'm going to do the official turret thing.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.800]   It's just me giving it away to one of my friends.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.800]   These are technically my friends.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   They're technically your friends.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.800]   You have 20,000.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.800]   So Scoble is at 14,000, 765.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.800]   I noticed that he continues as you grow, he grows the same pace.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.800]   What kind of growth curve is it?
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.800]   Should I join Twitter just to see how did you study this?
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.800]   John, you could get to 12,000.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   Look, I just crossed 12,000 a minute ago, by the way.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800]   I'm in 12,000 and four.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   I'm only 800 behind you, Calicannis.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.800]   John, we get 5,000 in the first month.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800]   Oh, instantly.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.800]   It's 10,000 a month, too.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800]   But you have to post, John.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.800]   You can't just go on there every day.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.800]   You have to say something pithy.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.800]   Can I find...
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.800]   Okay.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   You remember how you said blogs would never work and they were terrible and then you launched one?
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.800]   And now you're saying for a year that Twitter is terrible and now you're going to launch one.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.800]   So it's pretty much a good indicator of when something has reached the mainstream.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.800]   That's when you flip.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800]   That's true.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.800]   When John flips, it's mainstream.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.800]   It's basically when white people start using hip-hop terms, so you know they're out.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.800]   Nobody in hip-hop wants to go anywhere.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.800]   Thanks for the analogy there, Jason.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   I like that one.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.800]   So, no, John, you should be great to have you on there.
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.800]   That would be fresh, John.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.800]   It would be stupid.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.800]   It would be funny.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.800]   It would be fresh.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.800]   Oh, wow.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.800]   So, just so you know, Jason on Twitter is Jason Callicanis.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.800]   So you go to twitter.com/jasoncallicanis and you can follow.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.800]   He doesn't need any more publicity.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.800]   I like to.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   I want to encourage him because I'm going to beat him even though he's giving away all that stuff.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.800]   You're going to beat me.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.800]   I'm twitter.com/leoloport.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.800]   We'll not give a scobles address out.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:34.800]   Will, are you on Twitter?
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   I see you all the time.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.800]   Yeah, Twitter.com/willharris.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:37.800]   One else.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:38.800]   I just started doing in.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.800]   You know?
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.800]   We can't go and show without talking about Twitter.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.800]   John, what are you going to give away if people go to devorect.org/blog?
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.800]   I'll come up with something better than the Macbook Air.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:54.800]   If I give a Macbook Air out for first place, I'd have to give two out for second place.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.800]   It's a long way to go for that joke.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.800]   Don't give me some free advice.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.800]   What is it?
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800]   Don't pick any wood knickles.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.800]   Dorect.org/blog.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.800]   I still like, call me Ishmael.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.800]   That's good.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   I call me Ishmael.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.800]   That's good stuff.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:15.800]   Will, Harris is the head honcho at his very own television channel on the internet.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:17.800]   It's called channelflip.com.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:19.800]   And it's getting bigger and better than other.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.800]   And it's definitely well worth checking out.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.800]   Mr. Harris, it's great to talk to you.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:24.800]   I'm sorry about your laptop.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:25.800]   I hope that works out for you.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.800]   Dorect.
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:27.800]   Yummy, Beth.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.800]   Oh, compelled to use a Macbook.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.800]   Oh, I'm going to add Macbook keyboards that are filled with releasing hot black coffee.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.800]   One man stands alone.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.800]   I ain't getting his coffee.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.800]   Another twin is cutting vegetables.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.800]   It's in the can.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:55.800]   Oh, my God.
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.800]   It's like a thousand people just said a lot of me.
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.800]   Hello.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.800]   They're all saying, "Hi, Jason.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   How are you doing?"
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.800]   They can hear you too, I don't know.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.800]   Yeah, I know.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.800]   That's why I'm drinking with them.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:18.800]   400 people with no life, other than IRC.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.800]   You know what's sad is many of these people have actually been watching me do a radio show
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:22.800]   since 11 this morning.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.800]   Wow.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.800]   It's hard to believe this.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.800]   It counts me as one of those.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   I'm going to be around for more.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:38.800]   Do the twin.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.800]   Do the twin.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   Do the twin.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.800]   Do the twin.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   Do the twin.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800]   Do the twin.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.800]   Do the twin.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:45.800]   Do the twin.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.800]   Do the twin.
