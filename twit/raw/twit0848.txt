[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   It's time for Tread This Week in Tech.
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.680]   Oh, do we have a good panel this week?
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.560]   Louise Mazzakis is here now a freelance journalist,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.520]   formerly with Wired.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.320]   Owen Thomas is also your senior editor of Protocol.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.160]   And you may remember Evan Brown from this week in law.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.400]   It's his first time onto it.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.480]   Be nice.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.560]   Lots to talk about.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.040]   In fact, I'm going to query Evan about the Facebook meta
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.560]   trademark filing.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.280]   Boy, they sure are staking out.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.200]   A lot of areas that meta is going to be involved in.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.240]   And then why is the future mayor of New York City,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.760]   Eric Adams saying he wants to create a cryptocurrency
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.600]   for the city.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.720]   And we'll talk about the great resignation
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.640]   and how it all started with tech.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.120]   It's all coming up next on Twitch.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.400]   Podcasts you love.

[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.480]   This is Twitch.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.240]   This is Twitch.

[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.120]   It's time for TWIT this week in Tech the Show.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.200]   Yes, I'm back.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.720]   Thank you.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.440]   Thank you, Ian Thompson.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280]   Thank you so much, Ian, for filling in for me with Father
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.160]   Robert.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.040]   Great show.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.560]   And Brianna Wu.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.880]   But I am back in the saddle again.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.360]   We have a great show planned for you this week.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.960]   All the week's tech news with Owen Thomas, senior editor
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.720]   at Protocol.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.800]   Good to see you, Owen, in the office.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.640]   It's weird.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You got to show us your matching mask.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.760]   Come on, kid.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.520]   He's got his shirt and mask--
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.200]   by the way, beautiful shirt, kind of a Hawaiian style
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.240]   pattern and the mask matches.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.160]   So you bought the shirt and mask at the same time.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.480]   Is that a new thing?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480]   Apparently, there were a bunch of shirts, actually,
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.720]   that had that kind of bonus.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.200]   Wow.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.600]   Is it a Macy's or Marseille, as I like to call it?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.040]   I was going to fall into the gap.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.600]   But OK, good enough.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   Also joining us.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.240]   It's great to see you, Louise Mazzakis.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.880]   Now freelancing.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.800]   Great to have you on the show.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.440]   How's it going?
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.400]   I have to be here.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.040]   It's going well.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.040]   You're enjoying it?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.920]   Writing for a lot of publications, business
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.840]   insider, for one.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.440]   And that's wonderful.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.520]   Still covering China, as well as the tech industry.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   You got it.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.400]   And those two things combined.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.160]   I think you're not demand right now, because of the supply
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.880]   chain crisis and what's going on in China and everything else.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.040]   This is a good time to be a expert.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.880]   It's a really good time to cover China in terms of there's
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.560]   a lot happening, but it's also a terrible time in terms
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.320]   of you can't get into the country.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.680]   So it's sort of a weird paradox, in that sense.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.080]   But yeah, yeah, totally.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.120]   So in your coverage, did you travel to China a lot?
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.360]   Was that part of the deal?
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   So I was in the process of applying for a visa
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.520]   right when this all happened.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.680]   So it's been two years.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's been a few years of covering China pretty regularly
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.440]   while this has been going on.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.480]   But I got to go once before this all happened.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.200]   So I would like to spend a lot more time there,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.840]   but it's sort of really debatable.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.800]   I probably told you this.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.880]   And it's certainly on my Tinder profile.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.560]   I was a Chinese-- no, it's not.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.080]   I was a Chinese major in college.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.600]   Really?
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.880]   It used to be pretty well still.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.400]   I know.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   I forgot it.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.480]   But I did an intensive study for two years.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.280]   And I wanted to go, but this was a long time ago.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.400]   Nixon had just started to open it.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.160]   Did you even fly there at that point?
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.560]   Was it like-- I was probably like,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.040]   you had to fly through Hong Kong, right?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.840]   No, and you had to go as a governmental program,
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.640]   and you would stay in a comm unit.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.960]   It wasn't that interesting.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.400]   I've been there since, and I just love it.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.120]   I really love it.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.360]   Such good food, right?
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.560]   Oh, the food.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.640]   But I love the culture.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.120]   And one of the reasons I was a Chinese major,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.160]   I wasn't thinking about a career or anything.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.120]   I just loved it.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.560]   I loved the language, and I loved the culture.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.400]   It's really hard.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.680]   So I applaud you for doing it.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.440]   It's not easy at all.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.160]   The spoken language isn't as hard as the written language.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.240]   The written language is murder.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.840]   Murder.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   It's even hard to write.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.040]   Like, you should go back to being
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.200]   for years old with terrible handwriting.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.600]   But the spoken language is interesting,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.760]   because it's such an old language.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.080]   All the hard edges have been worn off.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.000]   There's no tenses.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.120]   There's no genders.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.600]   I mean, it's a kind of a very direct language.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.360]   So it's easy to speak poorly.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.000]   Let's put it that way, except for the tones.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.640]   It's like a lot like English, right?
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.360]   That's a sense of good.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah, in that sense.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.040]   It's not a Russian or Latin where there's
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.880]   all these declensions, and it's a complicated language.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.760]   Anyway, it's great to see you, Louise.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.000]   And I have to say the first time on this show,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.160]   but a long time, remember the Twit family, Evan Brown,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.280]   is here.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.000]   You remember him as former co-host on Twill, this week in law.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Is it intellectual property and technology attorney?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.480]   And you also teach law in Chicago, right?
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.120]   That's right.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.560]   That's right.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.120]   I teach a class on negotiations.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.280]   I'm an adjunct, sort of the one-a-be academic, I guess.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.840]   But Leo, it's wonderful to see you.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.600]   It's great to be back on this platform.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.560]   We were talking before the show.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.400]   It has been a great ambition of mine
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.760]   to be here on The Big Show for 15 years or so.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   The Big Show.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.480]   What a delight.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.720]   We're on The Big Show now, Evan.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.600]   This is great.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.680]   And I'm going to call on your legal services immediately.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.400]   Because last week, I missed kind of the big story of the year,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.920]   which is Facebook renaming itself to Meta, which I've been
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.880]   informed by the way is death in Hebrew.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.200]   So maybe not the best choice.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.640]   There is also a small--
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.040]   I think it's a Chicago company that's suing them now,
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.160]   because they say, well, we're called Meta.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.320]   But I did-- and thanks to John, who
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.720]   downloaded the 32-page trademark application for Meta.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.200]   And if you just look at the red part here, this is--
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.520]   so correct me if I'm wrong, Evan.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.080]   But when you apply for a trademark,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.920]   you say in what category, right?
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.480]   So I have a trademark, I think, for Twitter,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.200]   like news and television and internet streaming, things
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.720]   like that.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.220]   Right.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.720]   Right.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.640]   That makes sense, right?
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.840]   I don't have a trademark for popsicles named Twit.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.920]   Somebody could come along and have Twit popsicles.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.440]   That wouldn't be trademark infringement.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.320]   We're in different categories.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   Facebook apparently does not want anybody to use the name
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.280]   Meta for anything.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.640]   This is the description of their class.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.240]   Well, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.920]   This is the part in red.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.640]   It's like periodicals, electronic publications.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   Currency, virtual currency.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.600]   Downloadable software for selling and managing blockchain-based
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.160]   tokens.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.360]   It's for authenticating user access to computers.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.960]   Is this normal that you would claim this much territory
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.960]   with a trademark?
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.680]   Not real.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.720]   This is pretty extensive here.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.920]   I mean, a couple of things going on.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.880]   I mean, you put it-- when you file a trademark application,
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.240]   first you designate whether you've actually
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.080]   put it into use yet or whether there is an intent to use.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.240]   And so Facebook or Meta has filed an intent to use application
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.440]   here.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.240]   Put it in a number of classes.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.800]   One of them is Class 9, which is downloadable software.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.400]   Software that actually goes into the user's environment.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.360]   There's also classes within this application.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.280]   I think Class 41, Class 42, more of the hosted services
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   kind of things.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.920]   But Leo, as you're very aptly pointing out,
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.560]   there is just thousands of descriptions.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.200]   It's very long.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.600]   It's exhaustive.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.440]   It's ad nauseating.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.240]   Personal coaching services in the fields of sports, exercise,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.920]   health, and fitness.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.960]   I mean, come on.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.280]   You can't have it.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.480]   So what happens now?
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   Does the USPTO look at this and go slow down, big boy?
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.440]   Yeah, it'll sit.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.560]   First of all, it'll sit on the desk,
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.240]   so to speak, of a bureaucrat in Alexandria
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.800]   Virginia for three or four months, probably.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.600]   Then what the trademark examiner will do is look at it.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.520]   First, they'll do a search to see what other pending applications
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.160]   or registered marks are already out there.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.960]   And this is a separate issue to see what might be likely to conflict
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.480]   or what this might likely conflict with is already on the register.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   So it could be that there will be some issues.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.360]   The examiner may issue an office action saying there
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.000]   is a likelihood of confusion.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.200]   So we're going to deny registration of this mark on that basis,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.240]   too similar to something that's already on there.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.320]   Now, one of the things that's going to keep the examiner very busy
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.040]   is looking through all of these descriptions
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.160]   to see if they are accurate.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.520]   There are certain ways you actually
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.720]   have to-- your certain nomenclature, certain linguistic structures
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.080]   you have to use to describe the goods and services in the application.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.240]   So there may be problems right away.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.560]   And the examiner might come back perhaps in connection
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.880]   with the refusal on the basis of likelihood of confusion
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.040]   and say, well, this is too vague.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.360]   This is-- this needs some kind of clarification.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.080]   So getting to the point of what's going on here,
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:54.320]   why Meta has done this, is in the trademark prosecution process,
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.800]   the part of getting the application through to registration,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.200]   you can always narrow your description of goods and services
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.880]   you can always strike, but you can't add to it.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.600]   So it's good to start--
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.920]   It's big.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.400]   It's incumbent upon them to be as broad as possible.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.880]   And then you can take away as the intention becomes more clear.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.320]   But in any event, this is--
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.680]   I mean, I don't recall seeing anything like this.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.880]   At least among serious actors, you'll
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.600]   see people who don't know exactly what they're doing.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.520]   But I'll stand some--
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.160]   And I just did a search on test, the trademark database for Meta.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.040]   And there are 1,696 records with Meta,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.520]   including the Meta Mafia, arranging and conducting
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.000]   e-sports competitions.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.400]   I'm sure that e-sports is in the claim from Meta.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.480]   So trademark--
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   So is it typical for a company just to say--
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.400]   I remember with iPhone, Apple had a number of other companies
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.840]   that used that.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.120]   And of course, in the end, what happens to a company's suit?
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.480]   And Apple writes them a check, and they go away,
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.840]   change their names, or whatever.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.600]   Is it typical for a company just to say, screw it.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.200]   We're going to do this, and let's see what happens.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.080]   I don't know that that's always the smartest thing.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.880]   It depends on what kind of power you're
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.080]   bringing to the situation, what kind of resources you have.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.480]   I'm sure Facebook's one of those companies that
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.440]   has probably a building just for the lawyers, I would expect.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.080]   And an army of outside council really
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.560]   skilled outside lawyers as well.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.920]   So it's a little hostile, but I could see how Facebook probably
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.880]   is stomping on some other people's trade.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.360]   I think so.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.080]   I mean, the typical approach is to carefully consider
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.040]   this is under the category of trademark clearance.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.720]   A company's going to launch a new brand, a new product,
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.560]   under a new mark.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.280]   You look and see what else is out there,
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.480]   and you make decisions whether to go forward based
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.120]   on how likely you are to conflict.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.360]   But clearly here, this is a special case,
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.400]   a special circumstance where we know
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.880]   that there are enough resources behind the momentum
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.160]   that Meta will have still hard to get used to calling
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.640]   that to figure out how to get this done and clear
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.600]   the path one way or the other.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.760]   There's a company in Arizona called MetaPC.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.560]   There's a Chicago-based company, Meta Company.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.440]   In fact, Meta Company wrote a long open letter,
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.600]   and he said, in October, we had a phone call
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.880]   with Facebook's attorneys.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.480]   October 20th, we declined their low offer.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   So eight days later, Facebook filed for the trademark.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.360]   Oh, and are you aware?
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.360]   I imagine Facebook went to a branding company
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.720]   to come up with his name, right?
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.240]   - This was a very tight process from everything I've read
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.640]   and heard.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.720]   You know, it was really, as with many things at the company,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.600]   formerly known as Facebook, it was a Mark Zuckerberg
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.960]   production, he wanted to do this.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.200]   So it happened, and it happened very quickly.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.120]   I wouldn't be surprised, actually, if there were some,
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.760]   you know, blowback as a result of the haste,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.400]   but you know, this is the guy who came up with a slogan,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.600]   "Move fast and break things."
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.440]   - Right.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.760]   (laughs)
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.800]   - The thing that really strikes me is that,
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.200]   you know, Zuckerberg wants to use Meta
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.240]   to actually brand things.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.040]   So for example, Oculus, the brand is going away
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   as a VR brand, and it's going to be replaced by Meta.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.800]   And that's very different from what Google did
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.760]   with Alphabet, where Alphabet is basically something
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.080]   that comes up, you know, annoyingly, when you're writing
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.200]   about the stock or quarterly earnings,
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.960]   and then you never think about Alphabet,
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.440]   except in that corporate context.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.320]   Meta is different, it's not just the company name,
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.040]   it's going to be product names, too.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.760]   - So it's not going to be Oculus by Meta,
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.480]   it's not going to be Facebook by Meta, or is it?
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.680]   - It is going to be, there are, if you fire up
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.280]   your Instagram app right now, you'll see it,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.240]   it says Instagram by Meta, where it used to say,
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.720]   Instagram by FB.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.040]   - Right.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.320]   - And so they've already made that switch.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.480]   And sometimes it's going to be a product by Meta,
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.560]   and sometimes they're actually going to use
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.800]   from what I understand, from the company's announcement,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.880]   they're actually going to use the Meta name.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.040]   Portal, I believe, is a product that they made rebrand
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.720]   from Facebook Portal to Meta Portal,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   or Portal by Metal, yeah.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.640]   - So when Google adopted Alphabet,
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.000]   Google didn't go away, Alphabet became the shell company
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.400]   for a number of companies, including Google.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.640]   - Is that how Facebook is doing this?
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.560]   I'm unclear, Evan, do you have a better idea
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.080]   of what the corporate structure is?
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.640]   - I don't have the insight into it that Owen
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.360]   is describing that he has, but he's pointing
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.160]   to a really important distinction here
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.800]   between what is a trade name or a business name,
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.680]   which really doesn't have much of a public interface
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.600]   connected to the provision of goods or services.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.360]   On the other side is trademark use,
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.720]   which is what the consuming public sees,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.520]   and that thing, that symbol, that word, that logo,
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.480]   that they associate with the source
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.440]   of particular goods and services.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.200]   So Owen, based on what you're saying,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.440]   it sounds like the intention is to use it more
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.280]   in a trademark sense, attaching it to goods and services
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.920]   rather than just a corporate name,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.840]   but Leo to answer the real question you asked,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.120]   I don't know about the actual structure
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.200]   of Facebook, but it says Instagram from meta
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.640]   instead of Instagram from Facebook.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.960]   - And that would make sense if that's the name of the company.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.000]   - I'm not a Facebook user, when I go to Facebook,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.400]   go on Facebook, does it say meta.com?
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.120]   Or no, it still says Facebook, right?
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.320]   It's so weird.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.080]   - Yeah, it's still Facebook.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.760]   I think my question is sort of like,
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.720]   how much is this about Facebook's name?
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.720]   How much is this about damage control versus sort of sorting
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.520]   out a corporate entity?
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.360]   - But how stupid do they think Congress,
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.400]   the courts and the Department of Justice are?
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.320]   It's like, yeah, we get it.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.640]   You're the same company, we're still going after you.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.360]   It's the public, I guess they're trying to confuse,
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.280]   but it doesn't, I don't think we're stupid either.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.080]   Everybody knows what meta is.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.160]   - Still Facebook. - I mean, Ryan,
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.080]   and just like inculculical context,
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.760]   no one says alphabet is being sued.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.600]   It's still like Google and pretty much,
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.840]   most of the circumstances.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.640]   So like, Evan, you would know better,
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.240]   but like, is there like some legal benefit
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.920]   to having some sort of differentiation?
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.000]   So like the name of the company is not the same name
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.400]   as like one of your signature products, right?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.760]   Like, is there some reason you would wanna do that
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.440]   aside from like a reputational one?
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.800]   - Yeah, I can't think of a reason why you would,
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.920]   why the name would matter too much.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.040]   I mean, clearly you want to set up different entities
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.760]   so that you're managing liability
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.240]   so that the assets of one entity aren't on the hook
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.440]   for what one of its affiliates may be doing here.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.080]   I just get the sense that this,
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.920]   sitting all of the cynicism aside,
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.480]   not that any of us would be cynical, right?
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.600]   But sitting aside a little bit of this,
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.880]   oh, you know, what's Mark Zuckerberg doing?
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.240]   If we take it at face value,
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.280]   isn't this to sort of signal,
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.720]   isn't this sort of be a harbinger or an entry
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.120]   into the greater importance of the metaverse?
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.320]   - Yeah, but clearly, isn't that in and of itself?
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.440]   - I mean, he had that goofy pictures of him posing
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.120]   with himself in the metaverse and all that.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:32.160]   I guess, you know, usually the way a company
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.000]   repositions itself is they come out with a product
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.120]   to reflect that new positioning.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.480]   This is very Silicon Valley, you print the T-shirt
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.280]   and then you invent the product.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.320]   I guess you could say Oculus is kind of a metaverse
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.440]   and they have a weird social network inside of Oculus
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.200]   that is unsettling, at to say the least.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.480]   I don't know, that's technically it's called
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.720]   the Meta Platforms Incorporated.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.560]   - Yeah.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.560]   - So that implies that Meta is a umbrella organization
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.240]   over a number of platforms including Instagram,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.240]   WhatsApp, the blue Facebook and Oculus, I guess.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.800]   And then it's all meta, I don't know.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.840]   - One thing that fascinated me, Leo,
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.040]   is the idea that they're going to have a meta account system.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.000]   So in other words, you're going to have a meta.com account.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.760]   This is something that Oculus users really hated.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.440]   - I did, I stopped using the Oculus because of it.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.840]   I think it was-- - Right, because Oculus forced
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.600]   forced users to use Facebook as the login.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.640]   - So they're going to sub that in with meta as the login
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.960]   but it's really unclear how that is actually
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.880]   going to work in practice.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.560]   But I think the idea is that you do not have to sign up
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.440]   for Facebook, the social network, to get an account
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.440]   on these-- - Ah.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.320]   - On these services that are on her.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.600]   - That makes sense.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.440]   Okay.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.080]   - And I do-- - Was that a pause?
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.720]   - Go ahead. - Go ahead.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.920]   - Well, it wasn't there a time when Google required you
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.000]   to have a Google+ account to use YouTube.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.680]   And I mean, that was no fun.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.520]   - Not just a time.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.000]   You still do have to have a Google account.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.600]   In fact-- - Google+.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.960]   - I remember. - Yeah, right.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.840]   But still Google's Google.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.680]   We've now seen the unredacted attorney's general
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.080]   claims against Google.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.640]   We saw those a couple of weeks ago.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.800]   And it was very clear that this whole thing
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.640]   to get everybody to log into Google services once,
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.840]   whether it's through Chrome or through a Google service
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.920]   and then keep logged in was just a much better way
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.160]   of gathering information about everything you do online.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.560]   Yeah, so there's, I mean, clearly the Facebook
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.240]   has the same interest and having a meta login
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.480]   just would make it easier to follow you everywhere.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.620]   You go in the world of meta.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.520]   - There's one final trademark point that we got
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.360]   at least touch on.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.120]   It's probably pretty minor and the big thing
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.480]   before we move on from this.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   There's this idea that a trademark,
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.880]   you can't have trademark rights in a word
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.800]   that's merely descriptive of the goods or services.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.080]   And it can't, it is descriptive if it describes
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.240]   some characteristic of the product.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.920]   And so there is at least some nod to me made to the fact
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.320]   that the word meta is merely descriptive
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.960]   of those services in as much as they pertain to the metaverse.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.800]   Now it can acquire distinctiveness over time,
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.120]   but still there's no-- - No, there's--
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.720]   - In order to be comprehensive on our trademark.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.200]   - Yeah, and certainly if you look at the application,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.440]   it does include virtual reality game computer hardware,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.000]   augmented reality game computer hardware,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.400]   mixed reality game computer hardware,
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.520]   virtual reality computer hardware.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.880]   I mean, there's all of that, it's in here,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.480]   but also a lot of crypto.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.360]   And remember that Facebook attempted to create
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.880]   this Libra coin, I don't know what the status
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.960]   is of Libra, but Facebook was kind of embarrassed out of it.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.680]   But I could see a, there's clearly in this application
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.240]   the desire to create a meta coinage, a meta cryptocurrency.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.160]   And meta dollars, of course, why not?
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.560]   - Oh, Leo, that's actually a fascinating side note
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.720]   to all of this.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.280]   Facebook very quietly as part of the meta reorg
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.000]   took its financial arm, Facebook financial,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.840]   and rebranded it Novi, which was the name
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.480]   of its crypto wallet.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.080]   So Novi is now Facebook pay anything you do
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.920]   with Facebook and money.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.160]   - Is it just that snarky paranoia
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.280]   that you talked about, Evan, or is it really
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.040]   something we should be worried about?
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.120]   Facebook makes me nervous in their ambition.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.920]   Is that just paranoia, Luis,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.120]   or is there something really to worry about?
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.680]   - I mean, I think that there's something to worry about,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.440]   but I do worry about sort of like Facebook ubiquity, I guess,
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.560]   because like they are such a name
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.000]   and they have such bad reputation now that I worry,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.720]   sometimes like that there aren't more nefarious things
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.280]   that are happening with companies that are not household names,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.600]   I guess.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.920]   But I think that there's good reason to be worried.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.080]   And I think if anything, the last, I guess more than a month
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.320]   now, right, like the Facebook papers have sort of shown us
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.080]   that like they knew that there was cause for concern too, right?
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.040]   Like it's sort of the outside voice this.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.240]   I think that yeah, you should be nervous
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.200]   and you should be skeptical.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.880]   But I think also like also be conscious of making sure
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.400]   that there's still some air left in the room
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   for other things to be worried about.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.760]   - Oh, there's plenty to worry about.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.040]   I'm worried about everything, but I have to say
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.360]   that if the intention of renaming themselves
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.680]   was to calm people down, it did the exact opposite to me,
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.440]   especially when you look at this trademark.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.160]   It looks as if Facebook has grand ambitions
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.920]   well beyond a social network
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.120]   and that they're kind of establishing that whole idea
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.920]   in the renaming, or maybe I'm just again,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.400]   just being a little bit paranoid.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.040]   - I mean, I think it's a legitimate to think that,
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.280]   but I wouldn't let the trademark application
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.740]   in and of itself, you know,
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.520]   pour too much fuel on that fire.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.480]   - That's why you're honest is to calm me down.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.960]   Talk me off the ledge.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.880]   - Whatever I can do.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.720]   (laughs)
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.920]   - I appreciate it.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:08.280]   Here's a picture of Mark with his trying on zuck outfits.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.800]   I don't know why Mark doesn't understand how creepy
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.920]   this appears to people in the real world.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:18.440]   That's the, maybe in a way that's what worries me the most
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.160]   is that Mark seems to be in a different universe.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.600]   He doesn't seem to have a sense of how off-putting
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.520]   and scary this is for people,
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.800]   and how people are really worried about Facebook's
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.000]   invasion of their privacy.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.800]   He just says, "What's good if you connect?
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.280]   "It's good, it's good, it's good."
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.200]   - I think these companies have really strange
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.560]   internal cultures, and sometimes if you've been like,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.280]   sort of like lost in the sauce for too long,
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.480]   like I think that the presentation probably
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.680]   would have gone over a lot better internally
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.280]   is what I'm saying, because I think that there's
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.920]   a lot of historical weird, especially among people
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.160]   who are evangelists internally and have been there
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.000]   for a long time.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.160]   I think that some of these things that we might see
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.680]   as really weird or chuggy are not so,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.920]   and then all of a sudden Zuckerberg,
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.040]   even though he does this all the time,
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.640]   but I think then gets in front of the whole world,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.880]   and is like, "Right?
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.080]   "You're into this, right?"
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.520]   And we're all like, "No, no, no."
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.600]   - I think you're exactly right.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.400]   I think Google goes through the same thing,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.960]   because it's such an insular environment
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.160]   when you're working at these companies
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.280]   that you forget how normal people,
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.800]   in fact in general you could say that about Silicon Valley,
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.880]   you forget how normal people think about this stuff.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.200]   As engineers and technologists and enthusiasts,
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.400]   even I have this problem, I go,
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.040]   "Oh, this is great, a folding phone."
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.640]   And normal people go, "What?"
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.480]   (laughs)
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.320]   No.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.920]   So I think that is a big problem in these companies,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.000]   and I think it's just a problem in Silicon Valley in general,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.520]   which is one of the reasons more diversity
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.200]   in Silicon Valley is probably a good thing.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.040]   All right. - Yeah, I mean,
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.760]   I think it's the case in any big, big institution, right?
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.720]   Like if you sort of become too much part of that institution,
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.640]   but I think especially like Silicon Valley to your point,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.080]   'cause it's been sort of a very like homogenous place.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.440]   And you get on that bus, right?
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.480]   Like I always think about that,
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.920]   and it's just like how weird it is
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.720]   that you like get on the bus and you like leave town every day
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.600]   and go to like the Facebook village, right?
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.400]   Like the hedge fund guys in New York,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.600]   like also out of touch, right?
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.400]   But like we're all in the same subway,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.800]   we're all going to Manhattan, right?
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.880]   Like it's all like, we're all sort of there,
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.960]   they have to at least like, you know,
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.080]   be amongst the people,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.640]   but it's not the case in Silicon Valley,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.480]   you get on that bus.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   - Really anymore, right?
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.640]   But you know. - Well, they run
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.440]   from their trilevel condo into the leather clad
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.240]   and fire in of the Google bus with high speed wifi.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.040]   They bust down the mountain view,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.360]   they go into the Google plex,
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.800]   where all the bicycles, bicycles are rainbow colored
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.120]   and there's candy in the cafeteria for the taking.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.720]   And then they get, they never, yeah,
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.840]   they don't make a trip down to rainbow groceries.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.040]   They don't, they don't have to, they get fed.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.000]   - If anything, remote work makes us worse, right?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.280]   Because you are just completely in your bubble,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.080]   you're in Slack or Facebook even has its own version of Slack
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.280]   so they don't, you know, do it use the same tools
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.120]   as everyone else.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.880]   Like if you're in Google, you know,
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.320]   if you work for Google, you're kind of in this Google bubble.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.240]   - Yeah, yeah. - And you know,
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.000]   there's, if you work from home,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.760]   there's really no reason to kind of step outside.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.080]   - So I'm glad you're in the office, Owen.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.400]   - Exactly, I ventured out into the wild.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.000]   - Of downtown San Francisco.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.440]   I can report there's news on the apocalypse at the moment.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.560]   - What a relief.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.280]   Actually, it's interesting on this trip to Mexico,
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.640]   it was just on.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.560]   I found out, most of the people on it were geeks
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.680]   'cause it was Mike Elgin and his wife doing it
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.000]   and so they knew Mike, they knew Twit.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.720]   A lot of them were Twit fans.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.000]   There was only four other couples,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.160]   but one of them was a Facebook engineer
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.720]   and his wife works for the city government of San Francisco.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.680]   So it was a twofer, it was great.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.280]   They were really, very nice people.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.680]   I won't out them, but they were very nice.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.440]   And he pointed out and I wanna emphasize this,
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.280]   he says, "How ever you feel about the company,
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.240]   there are really great people working inside."
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.960]   And I think that's always the case,
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.480]   whether it's Microsoft, Google or Facebook,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.760]   the individuals, especially the engineers,
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.920]   I love every time I meet them, they're great people.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.440]   But something about the corporate layer
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.640]   is the disconnect, I guess, you know?
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.800]   - So Leah, there's no one good at Apple or Amazon,
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.640]   as I was saying.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.000]   - By Amazon and Apple too.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   No, I know.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.840]   - I'm just getting Amazon.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.920]   - Actually, as a tech journalist, I grapple with this.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.680]   I don't deal with PR people.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.600]   I try not to get to know people at the companies.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.440]   It's very hard to be mean and cruel about Apple
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   or Facebook or Amazon or anybody else.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.480]   If you know these people, you won't, I mean, for me anyway,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.880]   maybe not for you, Owen, but for me.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.720]   (laughs)
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.160]   I like 'em and I don't wanna say mean things
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.920]   and I don't wanna hurt their feelings.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.280]   So in a way, I try to distance myself from the individuals
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.640]   so that I can at least attempt to be objective about this.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.240]   Do any of, I mean, Louise and Owen,
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.880]   you cover the technology industry as your daily bread.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.160]   How do you grapple with that?
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.240]   - I mean, it is sometimes awkward at parties,
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   but I honestly don't get at parties.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.200]   - That's right, I don't go to parties.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.640]   - It's the same problem covering the White House
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.120]   and covering Congress.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.920]   It's beltway journalism.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.200]   You need these sources.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.280]   You know these sources.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.160]   You like these sources.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.360]   It makes it very hard to be critical
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.080]   'cause you gotta see 'em then at a party.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.480]   So I stay home.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.440]   Let's take-- - Yeah, I think--
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.280]   - Go ahead.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.600]   - You just can't like your friends
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.160]   and your sources can't be the same person
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.040]   and I think you kind of have to like make that choice
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.960]   pretty early, right?
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.800]   And like definitely don't,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.760]   you can't be friends with PR people.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.720]   I don't think really like actual friends, you know?
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.240]   But I think like in terms of sources,
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.720]   like you kind of have to decide.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.560]   - Right.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.360]   - All right, this person's my source or like, you know what?
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.480]   I actually like them too much.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.400]   Like we're gonna be friends.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.400]   - That's right.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.240]   I like a lot.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.280]   There's a lot of people in PR I like.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.760]   A lot of people are in PR 'cause they're likable.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.000]   And I don't wanna know 'em 'cause I don't wanna like 'em.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.080]   (laughs)
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.200]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.960]   When we come back, the new mayor of New York
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.440]   is taking his first three paychecks in Bitcoin.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.040]   What do we make of that?
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.320]   We'll talk about it in just a bit.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.160]   Our show today brought to you by the fresh air
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.280]   that I am breathing.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.040]   We first started using molecule a long time ago
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.560]   because we live in the country
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.280]   and there's lots of dust and pollen in the air.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.400]   And then the fires two years ago hit Sonoma County
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.160]   and we were so glad we put another molecule in the studio.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.840]   I have a molecule in my office.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.360]   We have a molecule in the three molecules in the house
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.520]   molecule is the future of clean air.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.760]   It is not a filter system that you're kind of used to.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.960]   It is an air, literally an air purifier,
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.200]   not just an innovation on the existing HEPA filters
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.360]   but a scientific breakthrough in air purification
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.920]   in this really important, not just because of COVID
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.800]   but in any office, this office, we have sealed windows.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.840]   Indoor air can be five times worse than outdoor air
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.760]   according to the EPA.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.320]   So having a molecule in here is so important to me
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.160]   molecules core technology, they call it PICO, P-E-C-O
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   photo electrochemical oxidation
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.760]   doesn't just trap pollutants, it actually destroys them
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.360]   and even smaller pollutants that a filter could capture
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.120]   viruses, bacteria, mold, even volatile organic compounds.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.280]   And if you're curious, if you go to the molecule webpage
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.960]   you can read the research where they show
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.360]   that the molecule reduces VOCs like formaldehyde,
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.320]   things that you can't see, you can't smell,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.520]   you can't trap with a filter but you can stop with PICO.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.120]   Molecule air purifiers are designed to help protect homes,
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.240]   businesses, even medical spaces.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.040]   They, by destroying pollutants and providing clean air.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.960]   In fact, molecules PICO technology meets the performance
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.040]   requirements in FDA guidance for use in help
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.520]   for reducing the risk of exposure to COVID
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.800]   in healthcare settings.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   The Molecule Air Pro-RX is a 510K class two medical device
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.520]   cleared by the FDA for medical purposes
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.760]   to destroy bacteria and viruses in the air.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.920]   A lot of dentists offices and medical offices have them.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.280]   There are a variety of molecules though,
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.680]   you may not need the RX version, the Molecule Air Mini
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.560]   for smaller rooms like a bedroom up to 250 square feet.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.080]   There's the Molecule Air, that's what we have in here
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.920]   for rooms up to 600 square feet.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.200]   Actually, we have in here the new Molecule Air Pro as well
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.600]   for 1000 square feet.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.520]   So really the whole studio has clean air.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.840]   There's even the Molecule Air Mini Plus,
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.280]   which helps protect small rooms with a particle sensor
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.040]   and auto protect mode, which adjusts the fan speed
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.920]   based on the sensor.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.200]   I love it, our Molecule is in the bedroom
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.920]   and I have it set so it comes on,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.000]   you can leave it on all the time,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.040]   that's probably the best way to use it
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.720]   but I don't wanna have that light in the bedroom.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.920]   So I have it comes on in the morning
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.200]   and I can just tell it's just burning up
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.360]   all the stuff it's trapped overnight.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.180]   It's very cool.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.080]   Right now you can save up to $120
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.800]   on Molecule Air Purifiers by visiting Molecule.com.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.760]   There's actually two filters.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.960]   There's a filter at the bottom
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.480]   that gets like the larger particles
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.360]   and then it draws the air up through,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.040]   it's a cylinder, it's beautiful,
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.280]   where there is a converter, a catalyst
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.840]   that then traps these smaller molecules
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.160]   and destroys them with light.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.800]   I forgot to mention it,
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.840]   but Mike Elgin carries a Molecule with them
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.800]   as they travel around and you need it in Mexico,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.920]   in Oaxaca 'cause there's so many wood fire kitchens,
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.680]   there's a lot of smoke
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.400]   and it's really, I kind of wish we brought our Molecule myself.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.440]   There's a lot of smoke from the wood fires

[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.600]   the research, the white papers,
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.000]   the description of that technology works.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.960]   I think any geek would be very interested in this.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.880]   It really is cool.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.000]   Offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T, molecule.com,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.600]   we thank them for their support of this week in Tekken
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.800]   for the clean air in the studio
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.320]   and I can tell you when the fires were happening,
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.800]   that was a blessing man, that was a stinky,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.600]   stinking situation.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:47.080]   So Eric Adams, who's, I guess, a mayor elect in New York City
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.520]   is gonna take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.520]   and he says, "Crypto should be taught in schools."
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.080]   What?
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.240]   What do you think, Louise?
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.040]   - I mean, one question I had
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.600]   and I don't know, like I'm not like a local city politics
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.560]   reporter, like I'm not the person to verify this,
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.880]   but like, does he have any crypto and do we know?
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:16.280]   Because like this to me is just like such like fodder.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.400]   - Oh, is it like when Elon says,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.720]   dogecoin is a great investment, you think?
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.680]   - I mean, I don't know if that's like literally his intention,
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.560]   but like it just really reminds me of like just like fluff,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.400]   right?
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.320]   Like it doesn't mean anything really.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.840]   So like it's just designed to sort of like get headlines.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.760]   - It reminds me a little bit of when for a while
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.280]   it was fashionable say, "Yeah, everybody,
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.680]   every kid should learn to code."
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.600]   - It reminds me of that too.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.400]   - Yeah, as if that's gonna save the world.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.760]   Oh yeah, everybody knows how to code.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.640]   Well, step three profit.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.200]   - Right, exactly.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.280]   - He said he was on CNN on Sunday.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.360]   He said, "When I talk about blockchain and bitcoins,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.280]   young people on the street,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.520]   this does not sound like an accurate anecdote."
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.960]   But young people on the street stopped and asked me,
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.360]   "What is that, Mr. Mayor?"
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.840]   He said, "And then they then of course,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.080]   they asked him, well, can you explain what it is?"
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   He said, "Well, I know, it's a challenge even for experts."
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.680]   (laughing)
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.880]   He says, "Bitcoin means a new, this is a quote,
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.600]   new way of paying for goods and services
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.920]   throughout the entire globe.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.160]   And that's what we must do.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.440]   Open our schools to teach the technology
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.800]   and teach this new way of thinking."
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.560]   - Oh boy.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.400]   - Oh boy.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.120]   - I mean, we're to start.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.400]   First of all, Bitcoin is not actually practical
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.640]   for everyday transactions.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.720]   I mean, if you look at the launch in El Salvador,
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.880]   where it was declared legal tender, it was very rocky.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.600]   They're using something called lightning,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.480]   which is a new technology kind of grafted
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.880]   on top of the Bitcoin blockchain
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.280]   to make transactions a little more practical.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.840]   The problem with Bitcoin is like,
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.680]   actually sending Bitcoin to someone
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.400]   and exchanging Bitcoin for dollars is very costly.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.480]   - Both not only in financially,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.440]   but also environmentally.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.280]   - Right.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.040]   It's computationally intense,
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.320]   which is kind of where both forms of cost come from.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:26.000]   And also slow, like the Bitcoin blockchain is very slow
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.320]   compared to like Visa or MasterCard.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   So, you know, I think he's getting way ahead of himself saying,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.200]   like you're gonna be using this to buy and sell some.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.640]   - He's putting his paycheck where his mouth
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.760]   is he's gonna take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin,
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.080]   which I'm sure is driving the city financial people crazy,
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.280]   like we don't know how to, what?
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.080]   (both laughing)
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.120]   - So I actually looked into this Leo.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.960]   And by the way, Eric Adams said he was going to take
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.400]   three paychecks in Bitcoin because he was trying
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.320]   to one up the mayor of Miami.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.440]   - Oh, it's all about that.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.920]   - Who said he was going to take a paycheck in Bitcoin.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.960]   So it turns out in Florida, there's a law that if you don't pay
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.880]   an employee in cash, if you use like some kind of coupon
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.760]   or script and the value of that coupon drops in value
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.200]   in the next 30 days, that you have to make the employee whole.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.880]   So there's a chance that, you know,
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.280]   - Oh my God.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.480]   - Francis Suarez might be able to double dip,
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.000]   like get paid in Bitcoin.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.600]   And then if the price of Bitcoin drops,
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.200]   he might be able to get a, you know,
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.560]   get a sweetener from the city of Miami.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.480]   I don't know that that, you know,
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   that has ever been applied to cryptocurrency,
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.040]   but I did find that law on the books in Florida.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   - Very interesting.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.360]   - And, you know, the whole idea, like,
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.280]   how are you going to graft Bitcoin onto a payroll system?
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.440]   There is a company that does this called BitPay.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.720]   And that though is mostly designed around the idea
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.880]   that you've got like contractors overseas
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.440]   and you want to pay them in Bitcoin.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.280]   - Right.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.520]   - Not something that's going to go through
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.000]   a regular American payroll system and like,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.200]   what are they going to do, take some satoshis out
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.160]   to pay for the Social Security and Medicare withholding?
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.000]   Like, and then what is the US Treasury going to do?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.640]   - I could just see the payroll people going,
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.680]   we don't, how do we, we don't, this doesn't--
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.520]   - How about?
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.200]   - Mr. Mayor, how about we give you cash
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.040]   and you buy Bitcoin and--
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.320]   - I think that's really probably,
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.680]   'cause and at what point, since Bitcoin is so volatile,
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.960]   when do you, when you make the conversion,
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.160]   like the last minute of the pay period,
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.440]   when, John, can I pay you in Bitcoin?
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.960]   Would that be okay?
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.960]   You want, yo, he likes that idea.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.040]   It's only going to go up.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.600]   It's all, yeah, well, we'll see.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:51.000]   It's only going to go up in the, maybe the long, the long run.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.520]   - There was an employer who paid an employee in Bitcoin.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.800]   And then when Bitcoin had an enormous run up,
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   he tried to get the money back.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.640]   - Can't do that, nope.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.840]   - Like you like the difference in what it was--
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.240]   - I overpaid you.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   You're right about Suarez, about Miami,
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.480]   because he also says, just like Miami,
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.120]   apparently Miami has, Suarez has announced
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.600]   they're going to have their own cryptocurrency
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.960]   called Miami Coin.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.640]   And Adams told Bloomberg Radio he wants to explore
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.240]   setting up a New York City cryptocurrency.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.440]   So it's not just Bitcoin.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.640]   He's, he loves it all.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.840]   It's all going to be good.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.240]   I think it's good to teach kids STEM.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.000]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.080]   I don't know if they really need to know about Bitcoin.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.800]   Maybe, I guess, blockchain, maybe.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.000]   - Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.560]   I mean, what politician's going to pass up the opportunity
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.440]   for some spectacle here?
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.720]   It's good to see this friendly,
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.600]   ribbing between-- - Yeah.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.640]   - Mayor, Mayor-elect Adams and Mayor Suarez,
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.000]   you can expect that.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.400]   And there's probably some truths to be extracted from that.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.000]   And that anecdote, I've been walking on the street,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   kids asking him about, I don't know.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.080]   - What is that, Mr. Mayor?
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.600]   What is Bitcoin?
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.440]   - Right, right.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.440]   I mean, clearly, I think reasonable person could suggest
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.720]   that it's good to learn about blockchain technology.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.400]   There's plenty of fundamentals there.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.120]   - And you could learn about economics
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.960]   if you learn about cryptocurrency.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.240]   I mean, you could see-- - I think you could see
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.240]   how it works. - Yeah.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.720]   - You could use this in an economics curriculum.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.920]   But I don't think-- - Yeah, very sophisticated
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.360]   understanding. - Yeah.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.200]   Exactly.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.560]   Yeah, it's just politics, right?
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.040]   It's just politics.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.840]   And I do think it has a lot to do with the mayor of Miami,
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.920]   getting a lot of attention for cryptocurrency.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.840]   - I think Miami and New York are both
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.640]   jostling for crypto startups.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.560]   I think that's real. - That's the real thing, right?
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.000]   That's where the money really is.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.800]   They lost out of Amazon's headquarters too.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.960]   So maybe we can get, I know, a Coinbase headquarters too.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.240]   I don't know.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.080]   - The gas you just-- - You want to be the leader?
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.080]   - Yeah.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.560]   - You just touched on a Leo in passing,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.720]   but my gosh, it must be so difficult for politicians
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.920]   to consider how to address the environmental issues
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.560]   of these, this entire-- - Well, that's a big one.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.240]   - Yeah, that's a big one.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.680]   - And I know it surrounds the whole discussion.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.240]   - When we bring this up, I'll be fair,
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.520]   there've been a lot of people who've said,
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.640]   A, well, you know whenever talks about how much
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.160]   the banking system costs environmentally,
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.080]   but there is an environmental cost to Visa,
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.320]   MasterCard and the banking system
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.880]   because they all are based on computers,
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.080]   it all uses resources,
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.240]   and we don't ever even make that calculation.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.800]   So maybe it's unfair to Bitcoin
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   to say how expensive it is environmentally.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.400]   And also there is maybe not so much with Bitcoin,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.080]   but certainly with other cryptocurrencies,
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.440]   like Ethereum, a move towards more environmentally friendly
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.720]   technologies like Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.560]   So I think people are aware of it.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.720]   I don't know how fair it is to paint Bitcoin
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.360]   as the environmental evil when we're also,
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.360]   doing all sorts of other things that might be equally evil
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.400]   and we just accept them because it's always been that way.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.520]   There is an interesting side light
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.600]   on the house infrastructure bill, which just passed.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.640]   It does have a crypto tax provision
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.000]   and a reporting provision that says you have to report
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.240]   if you and the crypto folks were a little upset about this.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.280]   If, let's say, Elmi,
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.240]   we've always said if the cash transaction,
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.560]   this has been for 40 years, is over $10,000,
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.240]   the law says that the recipient bank
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.080]   or whatever has to verify a bunch of personal information
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.360]   and notify the government.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.400]   Apparently now they're gonna have to do the same thing
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.500]   with crypto.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.760]   The crypto industry did not like this,
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.160]   but they were not able to get rid of it.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.840]   So the president is now, it's on his desk for signature.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:05.280]   The recording requirement, and this is from coindesk.com,
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.920]   would see all brokers report transactions
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.200]   under the current tax code.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.040]   I presume of a value of $10,000 or more.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.120]   Violation of this, by the way, is a felony.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.520]   And some have said, and maybe I'll defer to our attorney
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.640]   on the panel, that when applied to cryptocurrencies
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.920]   and other digital assets like NFTs,
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.200]   the law could be nearly impossible to comply with.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:35.120]   So that's something scary for people
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.120]   who are dealing with crypto.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.080]   I guess it's really gonna depend on how the treasury
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.800]   decides to enforce this and what enforcement they...
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   - Yeah, like, is this a case of the crypto community
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.600]   sort of like trying to read the tea leaves
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.080]   in regulation that's just sort of unclear at this stage, right?
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.840]   'Cause I know there's been a lot of sort of like
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.240]   understandable to some extent,
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.360]   but I know that there's been sort of a lot of hysteria
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.520]   in the crypto community about some of these regulations
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.800]   that are like targeted for a lot of crypto people.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.640]   - Right.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.000]   - The whole point is this is a non-governmental,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.800]   non-centralized thing.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.720]   Stay out of it.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.280]   - Well, and also specifically, it's one thing
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.880]   where literally the treasury or literally Congress
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.440]   is looking at crypto, right?
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.400]   Versus they're trying to regulate some aspect
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.840]   of the financial industry and the crypto community is like,
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.960]   "Well, if this is applied to us, we're screwed," right?
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.280]   And it's not clear to me that they're necessarily
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.080]   even like the target of this, right?
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.040]   - Well, I think it's also reasonable for governments to say,
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.360]   "Look, if the mayor of New York's gonna get paid in crypto,
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.520]   we need to be able to take taxes."
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.760]   I mean, it's not unreasonable if we're starting to,
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.840]   if crypto starts being used as a payment system,
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.440]   and I think a lot of crypto fanatics would like to say,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.680]   "Well, no, no, this is like barter.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.560]   This should be completely independent
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.640]   of any financial system and certainly not taxable."
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.360]   Well, bad news, I think it's already taxable
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.320]   and I think it's gonna get worse.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.680]   Their real concern was what is a broker?
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.440]   And 'cause brokers have this obligation to report,
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.280]   who is that?
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.000]   Does that everybody?
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   All brokers have to report transactions over, I guess, $10,000.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.760]   So anyway, that is the law,
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.480]   but how the treasury enforces it
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.800]   is really gonna be the question.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.920]   Anything to add to that?
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   I mean, this is not strictly in your ballpark, Evan,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.520]   but you are at least, you did pass the bar.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.360]   - Right, right.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.280]   Yeah, I would, you know, the first thing I would do
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.440]   would be call a tax attorney or an accountant,
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.160]   you know, to get on these things.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.800]   But, you know, just sort of underscore a couple
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   of the things that you said, Leo.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.720]   I mean, this seems to really be an attack
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.920]   at one of the fundamental, you know, talking points
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.880]   about cryptocurrency in general.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.120]   It's decentralized nature, it's anonymity,
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.720]   the ability to do these transactions
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.520]   without easily being traced
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.040]   and you're figuring out who that is.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.440]   But at the same time, I don't know
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.840]   that we should be surprised at all
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.880]   that the IRS or that there would be legislation
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.880]   that would at least appear,
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.640]   and I haven't read the bill,
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.480]   and I know that that's one of the things about it,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.040]   that it's this gargantuan thing.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.880]   - It's kind of big.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.720]   - Yeah. - It's just to it's in it.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.880]   But I mean, should we be surprised at a philosophical,
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.240]   you know, sort of abstract level
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:22.240]   that a progressive administration would sign a bill
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.360]   that was passed by a Congress comprised how it is
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.280]   that's going to give more power
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.040]   to the taxing authorities like this?
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.200]   So, I'm just really speaking in the abstract on those.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.440]   - It's a question, Mark.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.000]   - Leo, I think what it highlights
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.880]   is that we still don't know from the US government
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.000]   what crypto is.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.640]   Like, now we've got some tax rules here
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.280]   that suggest crypto should be taxed like securities
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.200]   because you're talking about taxing capital gains.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.960]   But there are other parts of the government
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.840]   that think crypto is,
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.160]   crypto currencies are currencies.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.600]   And that, you know, is it a currency?
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.560]   Is it securities?
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.200]   Is it property?
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.520]   You know, through NFTs in there.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   I think we still need a lot more regulatory clarity
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:13.520]   from the highest levels of government, what crypto is
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.440]   because otherwise you're going to have
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.520]   piecemeal regulations that don't fit together.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.080]   - As I remember the new Treasury Secretary,
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.880]   one of the things that encouraged people about this
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.120]   is that he understood a little bit about more than others.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.800]   - Oh, the SEC chair.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.600]   - Oh, the SEC chair, the Gensler, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.400]   Yeah, so maybe there is some intelligence coming
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.480]   to the government about this stuff.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.640]   I mean, I don't understand.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.800]   I think most people, there are so many ramifications.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.240]   There was a great piece in protocol about meme coins.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.800]   You know, my daughter's saying,
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.080]   "I got rid of my doge and I've got some Shiba Inu."
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.600]   And it's like, oh, dear.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.680]   (laughs)
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:59.200]   And all of it's highly volatile, right?
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.720]   - Don't say.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.960]   - Dogecoin now is now second to Shiba Inu,
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.360]   which is another dog.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.600]   Actually, wasn't Doge is she?
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.160]   - It's the dog, yeah.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.080]   - Doge is a Shiba Inu.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.000]   - So I'm very confused.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.200]   - So Dogecoin was a joke about cryptocurrency.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.280]   - Right, which became a real cryptocurrency
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.920]   that people made money on.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.320]   - Right, that like Robin Hood and even like SoFi
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.920]   supported trading in.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.440]   And then Shiba Inu coin came about basically
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.560]   because people thought, well, Dogecoin is a joke.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.800]   Let's make a joke currency about this joke currency.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.520]   It's a joke on a joke.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:42.360]   - And as with many things on the internet, it just took off.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.200]   - It's meta.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.240]   Oh, wait a minute, I can't use that anymore.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.160]   - Exactly.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.520]   You owe Mark Zuckerberg a thousand dollars.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.680]   (laughs)
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.420]   There's even a squid coin based on the squid game.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:56.440]   - Or was.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.480]   - Oh, what happened to squid coin?
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.240]   - Well, apparently the developers did what's called
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.680]   a rug pull, which means they issued the currency,
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.360]   they collect the money and they disappear.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.800]   - Oh.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.240]   - And that's, that is what people are saying
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.680]   seems to have happened with squid coin because like,
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.760]   it's just, it's gone and if you bought these,
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   if you bought these tokens, you're just out the money.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.480]   And of course, cryptocurrency transactions,
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.600]   as we know are in most cases, not reversible,
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.440]   not refundable, you really have no recourse
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.120]   if something like this happens.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.360]   So it's a cautionary tale.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.880]   And I think it's a hard thing to know what to do
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.320]   when there's some hot new token that like all the kids
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.280]   are talking about online is,
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:48.560]   should you go run out and facilitate trading in that
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.040]   if you're a business, if you're a coin base or a Robinhood
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.960]   or do you need to be a little more cautious?
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.760]   - Are we in for a few years of just craziness around all of this?
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.600]   I mean, we already have.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   - Already been a few years.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   (laughs)
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.320]   - But the series starts becoming,
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.280]   there's the governments involved and not just our government,
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.640]   governments all over the world and the World Bank.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.400]   And they're talking about stable coin.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   And as you said, we've even got countries using Bitcoin now
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.160]   as their currency, it starts to worry me
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.680]   that it's gonna be a little unstable for a while.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.480]   - You know, there's something kind of poetic.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.640]   - Go ahead, Louise, first, yeah.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.600]   - I think it is, but I also think that it's pretty clear
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.720]   that governments are moving towards some form
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.920]   of digital money, right?
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.160]   And like everyone, every country's gonna wanna have
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.160]   some form of digital money.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.040]   Like it doesn't have to be Ethereum, right?
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.600]   Or it doesn't have to be Bitcoin or something like that.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.920]   But I think that we're sort of moving
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.920]   to a completely digitized financial system
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.680]   and that countries are gonna like sort of get
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.320]   with the picture, I think, eventually.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.000]   What will it mean for $60 million NFTs?
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.840]   I don't know.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.680]   But I think that like, I have faith that like,
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.920]   sort of governments are gonna get with it
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.880]   because they have to and there are some benefits
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.440]   of this technology for them, right?
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.080]   So I think that, I think, but I do think it'll be like,
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.240]   continued to be a little crazy for a few years.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.760]   And it's funny to like watch the trends, right?
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   Like a few years ago was all about coin,
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.080]   initial coin offerings, right?
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.520]   And now it's sort of like gone to like digital assets,
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.360]   like NFTs.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.840]   - Yeah, ICOs are replaced by NFTs, yeah.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.240]   And ICOs weren't they kind of, people started realizing,
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.040]   it was scammy.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.680]   - I think it was also a regulatory thing, right?
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - I didn't really do.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.520]   - Yeah.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.680]   - Yeah, you couldn't really do an ICO in the US anymore,
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.120]   and then you couldn't do them in a lot of like,
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.920]   there's only a few countries, like least prominent
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.320]   sort of countries where there are large blockchain communities
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.240]   where you can really do an ICO anymore.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.080]   - Yeah.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:45.080]   - So sort of a cat and mouse game.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:49.080]   - My question is, is how big does a rug pull scenario get?
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.200]   Like, you know, let's say El Salvador is talking
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.360]   about issuing its own cryptocurrency.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:58.320]   So let's say you've got some small authoritarian government
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.480]   of a country and they issue a national cryptocurrency,
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.000]   and then they do a rug pull.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.440]   And like the president is like, you know,
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.560]   president is in their private jet off somewhere,
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:13.640]   and you know, like the GDP of that country is gone.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.760]   Poof.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.120]   - I mean, that's happened before, right?
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.040]   Like to some extent, right?
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.880]   I think it was a few years ago in Cyprus
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.480]   that all this had never one woke up one day,
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.880]   and the government just gave everyone's bank account
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.040]   a little haircut, right?
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.040]   If you like had your money in the national bank,
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.880]   it was like, oh, we're gonna just take off 10%
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.480]   of that real quick, right?
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.160]   So like, I think that's already sort of possible,
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.320]   but, you know, there are a lot of reasons
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.880]   why you might not want to, but yeah,
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.800]   I do think a rug pull from a government is amazing
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.920]   and terrifying.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.880]   And also I'm curious about like sort of organized crime.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.200]   I mean, they're ready, is that right?
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.800]   But like, you know, instead of doing ransomware,
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.760]   are these people gonna move into shit coins, right?
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.720]   Is that gonna be more of a problem?
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.200]   Like. (laughs)
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.560]   - Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.240]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.760]   - I actually, I should have mentioned this.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.440]   This goes back now to February of this year,
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.160]   but there was an article, I don't think it was widely read
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.760]   and medium by a guy named Evan Hatch.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.160]   It was a tribute, ostensibly, to a guy named Len Sassaman,
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.400]   who died 10 years ago,
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.160]   committed suicide 10 years ago,
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.760]   was a original cipherpunk and very involved
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.080]   in a lot of the early research on crypto.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.600]   His death was almost exactly two months
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.000]   after Satoshi Nakamoto's last communication.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.800]   And in this article, again, came out in February,
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.240]   Evan comes a little bit short of saying
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.080]   he was Satoshi Nakamoto,
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.840]   but boy, he sure gives some very strong evidence
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.160]   that if anybody was, it was this guy.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.280]   He certainly had the knowledge,
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.160]   he had worked on many of the early technologies
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:52.520]   that Bitcoin came out of.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:56.640]   Initially, PGP, he worked at PGP,
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.840]   and then later on anonymous remailers,
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.880]   which is really the ancestor to cryptocurrencies.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:10.000]   Anyway, I don't know, I wouldn't say pitch an article
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   to New York at Newsweek Magazine about this,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.760]   but I suspect that actually we do know
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.160]   who Satoshi Nakamoto was
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.280]   or one of the people who was very much involved in this.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.840]   And he passed away 10 years ago,
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.240]   which would explain why the literally billions of dollars
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   in Bitcoin held by that account has never been cashed in.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.760]   It's a huge amount of money.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.040]   - Oh, the person's debt, right?
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.360]   Like they got, I feel like no one is like that.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.720]   - Yeah, I think it was this guy.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.880]   It was 64 billion dollars.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:42.160]   Actually, it's more than that based on the latest rise
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.080]   in value in Bitcoin.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   It's a huge amount of untouched Bitcoin.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.760]   And I think it was in fact,
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.400]   I'm gonna put my money on it being this guy,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.040]   Len Sassmann, who has now gone 10 years,
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.800]   but who was a cypherpunk, very involved in all of this stuff.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.880]   It had the skills, the knowledge to do this,
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.440]   and was very much all about personal liberties, privacy.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.520]   He was fighting against government surveillance.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.440]   He was the kind, mentally,
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.280]   and the kind of guy who would create a cryptocurrency,
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.480]   and he had the chops to do it,
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.800]   which is kind of very interesting.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.640]   Anyway, I just,
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.520]   - Wouldn't he think it was crazy then
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.560]   to have government run centralized?
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:25.720]   - Absolutely.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.640]   That was exactly what they were trying to get around.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.240]   Decentralize.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.080]   - Yeah.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:31.920]   - Yeah.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.360]   I mean, there's so much that's paradoxical about all this.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.720]   I mean, there's the idea of that sort of becoming the norm.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.480]   And Leo, a few minutes ago, you asked,
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.680]   is this craziness going to persist?
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.880]   And I mean, certainly I think it's just going to get worse.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.720]   - It's going to get worse.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.560]   - It's going to get worse.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.400]   - Yeah.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.240]   - It's going to get worse.
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.080]   - And with new opportunities
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.160]   and the growing complexity of things.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.400]   And there's a little bit of,
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   it's interesting, going back to the squid coin situation,
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   there was in one of the articles,
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.920]   and the rundown was this guy in Shanghai,
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.080]   who lost 28 grand.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.320]   I think it's just interesting how,
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.760]   there's a certain correlation, certain certain,
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.320]   I was saying it was poetic.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.920]   That it was the squid coin that that happened with relating
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.360]   to the subject matter of squid game,
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.240]   where people are really in desperate financial situations,
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.800]   doing erratic things.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.880]   So yeah, there's, as long as humans have a certain desire
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.480]   in avarice, it's going to be this way.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.880]   - Speaking of desire and avarice,
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.000]   it's time for me to take a break.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.360]   But we will come back.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.520]   Great panel.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.440]   Nice to have you back, Louise, Mizzakis.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.760]   Now freelancer.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.920]   So what should people just call you
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.520]   and have you write articles for them?
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.360]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.080]   - Yes, please, I would appreciate that.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:55.080]   - Elmo Tzakis on Twitter, L-A-M-A-T-S-A-K-I.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:59.480]   S.O. and Thomas, senior editor over at Protocol,
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.800]   which is a great, relatively new publication.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.720]   Doing really, I'm just really impressed with Protocol.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.680]   Doing really good work.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.880]   Yeah, and of course our friend, Megan Moroni's,
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.720]   over there as well.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.160]   And speaking of friends, longtime co-host at Twill,
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.920]   this week in Law Evan Brown,
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.800]   attorney at Law in Technology and Intellectual Property.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.240]   Our show today brought to you by ESET.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:27.960]   I, for the longest time I would come into work
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.520]   and Russell, our IT guy, be there.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.400]   And I'd be like a scene out of marathon man.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.320]   I say, "Are we safe?
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.160]   Are we safe, Russell?"
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.660]   I'm so worried about getting hacked about
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.160]   phishing attacks.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.640]   Lately, we've been getting a lot of emails
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.080]   from people sending saying,
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:46.120]   "Thank you for the $500.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.960]   The invoice is here.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.040]   We appreciate it.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.400]   Hoping that we'll call and say,
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.920]   what are you talking about and then pay it?"
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.320]   They're constantly attacking.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.800]   And this is why when I ask Russell, are we safe?
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.480]   And he says, "We're safe."
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.320]   I say, "How?"
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.560]   He says, "We use ESET,
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:05.360]   the global leaders in cyber security."
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.240]   ESET, we hear from them all the time
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.800]   because they are leaders in security research.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.280]   Three times a year they put out their ESET threat report.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.000]   This is actually a new for Steve Gibson quoted in others.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.600]   It's a 40 page report.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.560]   You can get it right now if you go to welivesecurity.com,
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.600]   search for threat report, you'll find it.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.640]   Fascinating stats and actionable insights
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.360]   on topics like info stealers, ransomware, stocker wear,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.760]   more of the kinds of phishing attacks
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.760]   I was just talking about.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   This is why we're really happy we use ESET.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.440]   You know, our editors,
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.560]   they do all of our editing using Adobe Premiere
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.560]   on lovely Dell precision workstations running Windows 8.1.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.920]   We don't want to upgrade them to a later version of Windows
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.600]   'cause it's a nice stable environment,
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.200]   but how do they stay safe?
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.960]   We put ESET on those machines.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.120]   And the thing about ESET that I've always loved
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.080]   is it's lightweight.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.040]   It doesn't use a lot of resources,
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.800]   whether it's CPU or memory.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.160]   So you get protection, top notch protection
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.120]   without slowing down.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.320]   And that's something the editors really appreciate.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.560]   It's faster and more precise
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.640]   and typical endpoint protection
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:18.320]   because of something called ESET's Dynamic Threat Defense
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.040]   or EDTD.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.200]   What they do, this is so smart.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.240]   When an email comes in with an attachment,
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.680]   they use cloud based sandboxing technology
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.280]   to isolate and detect never before seen threats.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.400]   So this is really important
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.160]   because the threats are constantly changing.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.000]   You can't just scan for known threats.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   You've gotta proactively find these threats
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.400]   and detect kind of malicious software.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.680]   And that's what EDTD does.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.600]   It looks at documents, at scripts,
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.040]   and installers, executables, of course,
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.640]   runs them in the cloud, not on your systems,
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.640]   not on your network.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.160]   It puts them up in the cloud, runs them,
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.240]   and analyzes them in this safe sandbox environment.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.080]   So they get code analysis and deep inspection.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.080]   They use machine learning in memory.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.960]   They actually look at the memory analysis.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.800]   They use AI.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.560]   They're looking for behavior based malware.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.120]   They look at behaviors and they can allow
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.000]   or block a file in minutes.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.320]   So before those files even touch your servers,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.160]   but they touch your computers,
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.600]   ESET is scan them and approve them.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.760]   Or you never see it at all.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.960]   And this is amazing speed with no demand
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.680]   on system resources.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.640]   That's what something Endpoint Detection just can't do.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.360]   No one wants their organization to be patient,
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.960]   zero, and a cyber attack.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.040]   We never saw this one before, but hey,
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.880]   you got it, congratulations.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.880]   If you want, you don't wanna be that guy.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.600]   If you're looking for world-class ransomware protection,
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.480]   you're gonna want ESET's dynamic threat defense.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.400]   And it comes, of course, with ESET Protect Complete.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.440]   That's what we use.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.160]   It includes Endpoint Security.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.920]   You get a full disk encryption too
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.640]   with a really good encryption technology.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.200]   Advanced Security for Microsoft 365.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.040]   We use that.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.640]   Lisa loves her Excel.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.920]   So they have native protection, but there are gaps
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.680]   and that's why ESET is so important.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.560]   Right now, ESET Protect Complete is 20% off.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.520]   You can try it before you buy it.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.400]   Get your free ESET business trial
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.640]   and an interactive demo.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.680]   Go to business.eset.com/toit.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.560]   We use it, it works.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.000]   I don't know how we've, I feel like we've skated by,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.600]   never had a problem with malware.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.320]   I guess I can thank Russell and I can thank ESET.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.680]   You can't have Russell, but you can have ESET Protect Complete.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.040]   20% off with our limited time offer.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.920]   Go to business.eset.com/toit.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.080]   Russell not available.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.160]   He's mine, damn it.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.160]   But I swear the poor guy constantly go,
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.240]   "Are we safe? Are we safe? Are we safe?"
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.080]   Yes, we are.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.520]   Thanks to ESET.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.720]   We really appreciate it.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.840]   Let us continue on.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.120]   Oh yeah, Pappy Cappy just read the article
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.160]   I was talking about about Len Sassmann
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.160]   and there is actually a tribute to him
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.120]   embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain permanently.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.720]   Another reason to account.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.640]   It's interesting.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.360]   It's interesting, I don't know.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.320]   I wouldn't, I don't know.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.560]   Nobody's making any claims.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560]   Let's talk about chip shortage
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.600]   because it's far from over.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:30.520]   Now they're saying not next year,
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.480]   but the year after before this starts to ease up.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.120]   Wall Street Journal saying 2023.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.440]   Louise, is this a China problem?
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.520]   Is it a US problem? What's going on?
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.440]   That's a good question.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.720]   So I think that there are a lot of issues here.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.040]   One of them is also just like more demand than we expected,
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.000]   like people bought a lot more cars,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.360]   they bought a lot more computers,
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.560]   they bought a lot more other sorts of electronics
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.960]   during the pandemic than was sort of projected.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.560]   And also what you see with chip development in general
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.600]   is that it's the cyclical process that takes a while.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.520]   So we develop new chips.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.280]   We figure out how to manufacture them on a big scale.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.520]   We put all those chips in electronics,
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.960]   then we put all this money back into R&D
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.520]   and that process happens again.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.560]   And over time we've seen sort of the pace
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.760]   at which chips improve,
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.160]   has sort of been like the access to shapes like this, right?
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.440]   It's been like going,
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.040]   then it might be slowing down.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.160]   So there are a lot of things happening
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.680]   and the chip market is really complicated.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.720]   But yeah, there definitely is part of this,
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.640]   which is like supply chain problems
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.040]   because of factories in Asia.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.320]   So yeah, I think that that's part of it,
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.040]   but it's a really complicated market.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.320]   And I think supply chain is really complicated
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.000]   and we're seeing slowdowns everywhere
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.040]   with all sorts of things.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.320]   And I think it's really sort of exposing for people
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.640]   that the magic of how they get that Amazon package
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.680]   the next day is a really complicated chain of events, right?
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.720]   And that's true for chips
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.800]   and that's true for basically everything else.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.440]   It's always sort of unsettling though, right?
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.280]   When you realize like,
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.520]   oh, I can't get the new iPhone
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.080]   because like that's something we sort of expected
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.760]   to be the case for 10 years.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.520]   - Apple and its quarterly results,
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.760]   I'm sure we reported this last week.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.080]   So they lost $6 billion thanks to the chip shortage
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.800]   and manufacturing delays because of it.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.280]   - But they also had a revenue or profit.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.920]   - They made money.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.720]   - They've most money ever, right?
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.760]   Like that's a record profit.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.600]   - Well, that's Apple.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.680]   - That's Apple, right?
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.880]   Oh, we couldn't, we lost $6 billion,
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.160]   but we still had record profits.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:42.840]   - Right, right, right.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.820]   Like I'm like, okay, this is dire,
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.280]   but like, is it also that like,
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.700]   you can't keep the electronic in the shelves?
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.660]   Like, is that part of it, right?
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.340]   Like are you selling a lot more?
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.400]   - Well, and Apple's always been the poster boy
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.540]   for how to do this, right?
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:57.540]   They went to TSMC and basically bought up all their production.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:01.180]   And actually, this I think has been part of the problem
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.620]   I've heard as well,
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.820]   companies like Ford, Car Companies, Apple and others,
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.620]   hoarding chips, especially these legacy notes,
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:13.020]   chips not the, you know, the A15 or the M1,
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.340]   but the little, you know, do-hickeys
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.240]   that do things like acceleration and GPS,
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.020]   those are traditional chips,
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.000]   others are vying for those chips.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.940]   So these companies are buying them in great numbers
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.340]   and hoarding them before they're even using them,
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.420]   which makes it worse for everybody else as well.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.380]   - I know I saw the list of like some of the things
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:33.340]   that we're gonna be delayed.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.020]   And it's so interesting to see just like
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.740]   how everything has a computer chip now.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:39.620]   Like one of the lists was like smoking devices.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.300]   You know, like your jewel, right?
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.140]   Like your jewel.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:42.980]   - Oh no!
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.140]   - Yeah.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:44.980]   I mean, I don't know about it,
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.660]   but like, you know, some of these smoking devices,
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.580]   it's just so, you know, it's become so ubiquitous
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.180]   that we don't realize like how many things
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.020]   that's gonna affect.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.140]   I think cars is really big.
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.460]   I think sort of for your average person.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.620]   'Cause of course your car has computer chips in it, right?
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.660]   But like, I don't think, you know,
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:03.100]   - But if I can't say now we're talking serious,
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.240]   serious, bro.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:08.700]   - No, Lisa ordered a car in the summer.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.020]   She wanted to get at one of the many Cooper,
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.420]   electric mini Coopers, was told to be 10 weeks,
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:16.540]   then got an email saying, "Oh, that's gonna be 18 weeks."
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.500]   And supposedly it's gonna come next week.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:22.460]   But it really, that's the shortage right there.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.660]   Really interesting medium post by Ryan Johnson.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.300]   He says, "I'm a 20 year truck driver.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:31.060]   "I'll tell you why America's shipping crisis will not end."
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:36.060]   And he points out that it's not boats lined up
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:39.740]   at the container ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.980]   It's that you don't have enough crane operators
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.140]   to offload the boats.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.740]   You don't have enough trucks to take what's offloaded.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:51.460]   He says, "There's a huge crisis in truck drivers."
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:54.620]   And this then ties into this,
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.620]   the big, what do they call it,
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.060]   the grand resignation that's happening in America
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.740]   where after COVID people are not going back to work,
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:04.260]   they're saying, "I don't want that crappy job anymore."
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.100]   And this guy's describing, you know,
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.940]   if you're not a union driver, it's a nightmare.
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:13.500]   You could spend a day waiting for a container
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.020]   to be unloaded and you don't get paid by the hour,
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.020]   you're getting paid by the delivery.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.500]   And so you're making pennies an hour
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.060]   because of the short staffing and the slow offloading
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:26.780]   and so forth.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:30.420]   So there is a complex chain of problems.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.060]   - Yeah, and that issue that you're describing,
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.580]   like it didn't used to be that way, right?
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:36.540]   Like we turned a lot of truckers in this country
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.100]   into independent contractors.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.340]   And it was like, "Here's how you can get rich.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.540]   You can buy a truck and become an independent
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:43.820]   trucking contractor."
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:46.060]   And it caused a lot of problems clearly, right?
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:49.540]   Like it made the job a lot harder, put people in debt.
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.020]   And now with these shipping delays,
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:51.980]   they're not getting paid, right?
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:53.940]   It's like, what's the incentive to do that job?
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.140]   - Right, right.
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.700]   He says, "This is the new normal
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.380]   all brought to you by the experts,"
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.020]   right, our supply chain.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:05.860]   But it also, these experts, it made sense
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:09.900]   when demand was consistent and supply was consistent,
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.500]   you could do just in time shipping,
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:15.140]   just in time manufacturing, but it all collapses.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.420]   If there's a hiccup at any point COVID started it,
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:21.460]   but then in the light of COVID, there was greater demand.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.500]   That caused a bigger problem.
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.140]   So it's a whole bunch of things.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:28.020]   It's a mess and it's not gonna go away.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.340]   Maybe not even till 2024, according to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.900]   There are things you can order things now.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:36.580]   You won't get until 2024,
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.060]   which is kind of mind boggling.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.940]   - Leo, have you, do you have any good stories
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.860]   like the funny things besides the midi Cooper,
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.740]   we're just sort of expected that you have discovered
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.420]   you can't get or that have been out?
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.700]   - I don't have a funny story.
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.100]   I have a story that makes me wanna cry.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.620]   We ordered, I ordered because we wanted to try
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:59.620]   then review the new Apple MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.620]   And I ordered it immediately.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:02.860]   Like as soon as they an asset, I said,
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.100]   oh yeah, we're getting that.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.780]   So we could review it and then our head editor,
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.540]   Anthony, who's using an old Intel,
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:13.540]   old two year old Intel MacBook, he needs a new one.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.860]   This would be a perfect replacement.
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:18.660]   It was supposed to come on Monday.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.740]   And I don't know what happened.
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.860]   The FedEx guy just didn't even attempt to deliver it.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.860]   They just returned it and said,
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.860]   "Ah, we don't know where this is."
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.540]   Even though we get to live FedEx deliveries every day here,
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.540]   for some reason, so I called Apple.
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:34.860]   They said, "Oh, it's too late.
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.100]   It's been returned for a refund."
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.100]   We'll refund you in a bit.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.940]   I don't know when.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.100]   We'll see when we get the money back.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.460]   So I said, "Well, can I order again?"
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.460]   They said, "Yeah, you'll get it.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.620]   You probably get it before the end of the year.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.180]   Maybe right around Christmas time."
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.060]   It's like, well, so that's not a funny story.
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.740]   It's just a painful story.
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.980]   - And it's very painful.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:56.660]   - Yeah, not that we, not that we're,
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:57.860]   I mean, I'm sorry, Anthony.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.820]   It's more painful for him than he's really.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.820]   - I interviewed a CEO recently.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.500]   He told me that back in January 2020,
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.740]   after he was hearing about,
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.380]   it wasn't a pandemic yet,
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.900]   but the COVID-19 was getting more and more serious,
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:18.340]   he bought thousands, tens of thousands of PCs
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:24.260]   for his employees, just to make sure
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.140]   that they'd have them to hand out.
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.020]   And sure enough, it became--
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:28.860]   - It's my man.
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:33.860]   - It was a good bet because everyone who tried to go remote,
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:36.700]   like with a snap of their fingers in mid-March
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.020]   and discovered, "Oh, we don't have enough laptops.
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.740]   We have desktop PCs for our computers
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:44.500]   and people can't take them home.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.740]   And we don't have enough office chairs.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.260]   We don't have enough monitors.
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:55.180]   But I think there's this stuff that started in the pandemic
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.660]   for kind of understandable reasons.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.340]   And now it just kind of feels like rippling chaos.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:00.180]   Like--
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:03.260]   - That's a great description, rippling chaos.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.860]   - That's exactly what it is.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:06.700]   - Yeah.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.940]   - And it's just like not attributable to one cause.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:12.220]   Like people say, "Oh, the problem is that Long Beach
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.100]   in Los Angeles only lets you stack containers too high
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.060]   because they're eyesores.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.980]   And like if you just stack them higher,
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.500]   that'll fix everything."
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.740]   No, no, that's not going to fix everything.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.780]   And people ignore that it's actually partly
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.900]   because of increased demand.
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:31.180]   It's not, there's a, the pipeline is choked
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.780]   because there's so much demand as well.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.260]   - Right, you used to be able to say like,
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:38.660]   "Okay, around June, that's when you need to start
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.460]   stocking up on beach balls."
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.300]   Right?
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.980]   Like you could have sort of like these predictable cycles
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.900]   of like, okay, early February,
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:49.380]   like you need to like increase your like chocolate box stock.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.220]   Right?
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.780]   Like it was sort of these very predictable cycles
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:53.580]   and COVID totally messed that all up.
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.420]   And it's so mysterious.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:57.100]   I went into like, it's called ASOP.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.140]   It's like a fancy Australian like skincare
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.660]   and like, you can get soap and stuff there.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.300]   And I just wandered in there in Brooklyn yesterday
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.180]   and they had these very polite,
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.180]   really like discreet little signs
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.820]   that were like due to raw material shortage.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.780]   Like this item to say. - No, no.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.380]   - And I was like, what is it?
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:16.140]   Like what it like, but like they had like,
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:16.980]   you know, - What could it be?
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:17.820]   - You put some of their stuff.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:18.660]   - Right. - So like what is it
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.900]   in like that one cream that you can't get?
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.260]   - Maybe you don't wanna know.
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:24.100]   Yeah.
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.900]   It's, there's a big cobalt shortage.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.060]   Yeah. - Right, is there,
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.060]   'cause they're cobalt in the cream?
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:31.420]   I don't know. - You don't wanna know.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.620]   No, I think that that's the problem is it,
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.100]   that's what Rippling Chaos is.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.380]   It's a lot of different things in a lot of different areas
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.980]   and a lot of different reasons.
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:44.100]   And it really, I think we've been living fat and happy.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.260]   I don't wanna bring you down,
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.900]   but I just wanna point out that in every case
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:52.100]   when they talk about a metaverse in science fiction,
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:57.100]   whether it's Snow Crash or NeuroMancer or Ready Player One,
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:02.020]   it's as an escape to a horrible corporate dystopia
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.940]   that real life is so miserable
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.820]   that people wanna put on the glasses and go play
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.260]   in the metaverse.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.620]   So maybe Mark Zuckerberg has his figure
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:14.420]   on the pulse of the future.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.220]   - You need chips to power that though.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.060]   - Oh, that's true. - Yeah.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.780]   - Welcome to dystopia. - Yeah.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.060]   - Yeah. Oh, and I'm so glad you used the word Rippling
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.420]   'cause that's how I was thinking about Rippling Chaos
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:25.260]   is the term used.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.420]   I was thinking about the Rippling effect.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.260]   I mean, particularly with the chip shortage,
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:33.740]   it really expands out to affect so much more than just goods,
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.820]   but it really starts to affect innovation as well.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.660]   I mean, look at what cold water this is for,
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.660]   the development of IoT technologies, innovation,
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.220]   and hardware there, and then of course,
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.860]   the innovation in the software
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:46.980]   and the networking and everything else
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:47.860]   that goes around that.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   So Rippling is a very accurate way of thinking about these effects,
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:55.980]   particularly when it's something as critical
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.660]   as a chip shortage here.
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.500]   - And there is a cryptocurrency named Ripple.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.620]   So it all comes around.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.420]   - Man, I was thinking of the Grateful Dead,
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.260]   but we're all good.
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.500]   (laughing)
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.900]   - Let's see, what else?
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:14.500]   - Daylight saving time to change your clocks?
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.500]   - Showed up an hour early.
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.940]   - We can't change our clocks because they have--
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.380]   - They change themselves.
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.420]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:27.060]   - I have a clock that was built in Ukraine,
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.300]   and it set itself to standard time last week.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.340]   (laughing)
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:37.180]   Apparently, so as everybody knows, in the US,
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:42.180]   we just now set our clocks back this morning at 2 a.m.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:45.700]   I think we're one of the last countries to do that.
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.500]   I don't know why we still do that.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.140]   All the evidence, all the research shows
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:54.780]   it's both psychologically and physiologically harmful.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.980]   It doesn't save energy.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.740]   It's got no real purpose.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:02.220]   It's just one of those things that's hard to change.
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.900]   I was talking about this with my wife this morning.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.740]   She says, "Well, I don't think we should change
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.260]   "to standard time.
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.660]   "I think we should just make daylight saving time permanent,"
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.580]   which seems to be a popular thing,
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:15.300]   but that would require, I don't know what that would require,
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.540]   because that's your time zone.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.700]   It's basically saying, "Well, we don't want to be
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.380]   "in this time zone.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.620]   "We want to be in a different time zone.
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:27.500]   "I don't think you, I don't know who's in charge
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.060]   "of time zones, but can you just say,
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:33.260]   "Oh, we decided we want to be in the time zone one over?
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.180]   "I don't think you can do that."
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.220]   Can you, California--
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:40.380]   - It would make our situation with Canada and Mexico
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.220]   would get weird.
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.740]   - Very confusing.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:44.060]   - Yeah, that's the, like, thing about--
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.900]   - I think they try to make the times,
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.340]   they're not perfect, but they try to make them align
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.180]   with longitudes.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.060]   That'd be this thing where they'd launch it,
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:51.340]   and then we'd go over like that,
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.700]   and then we'd go over like that.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.620]   There are a few places in the world like that,
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.540]   but I, it doesn't seem--
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.020]   - I hear it's bad for you, like, to live really close to a time.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:04.860]   Like, if you, like, basically should be one hour different,
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.420]   but you're like right on the border,
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.380]   it makes sense, right?
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.860]   'Cause there's no, like, radiation.
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:10.700]   - Yeah.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.060]   - Like, there's no, yeah.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.220]   One thing I was just thinking about is,
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.100]   I don't know if this is like a thing,
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:18.860]   but I wonder, is it fun to be in a bar at like 2 a.m.
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.300]   on a Saturday, right when this is happening?
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.860]   'Cause everyone like, one more hour in a bar.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.620]   (laughing)
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:27.140]   - It's not closing time yet, buddy.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.180]   - Yeah, like, I mean, the bars can be open
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.260]   later in New York anyways,
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.140]   I don't know if it like changes anything,
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.820]   but in, 'cause there are a lot of cities where it's 2 a.m.,
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:36.660]   right?
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:37.500]   So does that just happen?
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.740]   And everyone's like, "Ha ha, never mind."
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:42.820]   - In California, we had, it was a ballot proposition.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.500]   And at one, I don't know if anybody remembers this,
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.900]   but back when was it June?
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:52.100]   We had a vote and we all said we wanna stay on daylight.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.660]   I think we all said we wanna stay on daylight
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.060]   same time, I don't remember now.
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.220]   And then the next step is the legislator has to approve it.
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.900]   And then I don't know, the National Bureau of Standards
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.820]   and Time and the clock key master has to approve it.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.180]   And it never happened.
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:11.180]   In Europe in 2018, they, the EU,
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:15.940]   ordered everybody to stop doing it.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:19.460]   No more setting the clocks back.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:22.140]   They actually, this happened in 2018,
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:24.420]   the European Parliament voted to end the practice
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.700]   after a poll, I'm reading from ABC News,
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:30.220]   of 4.8 million Europeans showed overwhelming support
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.340]   for scrapping daylight saving time.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:36.220]   The time change will be abolished.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:40.900]   Said the then president, John Claude Juncker.
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.700]   People do not want to keep changing the watches,
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.340]   but the long comes COVID was supposed to happen this year.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:50.940]   And because I don't know how COVID is,
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:54.340]   among other things, it's delayed the time.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.300]   So it's not gonna happen, I guess.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:03.180]   I just, I don't understand why we still do this.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:06.060]   It was to save coal back during World War I.
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:10.100]   Have we not saved enough coal yet?
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.900]   The only, just.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:15.340]   - Doesn't Arizona rebel already?
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.940]   - Arizona, Hawaii, don't do it.
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.340]   Yeah, they don't do it.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.620]   Only about 70 countries still observe daylight saving time,
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.380]   by the way, it's not a majority.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:26.180]   So.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.500]   - Maybe we're going to have to adjust time zones
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.900]   so that we can reserve energy for cryptocurrency.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:32.740]   - That's it.
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:33.900]   (both laughing)
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:36.940]   The cryptos, there is, I mean, I think there's an argument
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.060]   to say when one time globally, right?
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.380]   - Well, China does this.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:42.380]   China has.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.220]   - Many times.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.980]   - China spans five times over there.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.180]   But they only allow Beijing time.
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.180]   - Right.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.020]   - So.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:49.860]   - You just get out of the place.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.940]   - The fact the sun sets at three in the afternoon,
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.940]   I mean, you just get used to it.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.980]   Cows don't care.
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:58.180]   They don't look at the clock, say,
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.260]   "Well, you shouldn't be milking me now."
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.060]   They look at the sun.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.620]   - So the day would change.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:06.180]   The date would change globally.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.820]   But all the same time.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.900]   - Do you still have to have the international date line, right?
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.580]   I mean, there still has to be that.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.420]   No?
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:15.260]   - Would you?
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:18.500]   - If you just say it's all one time to UTC everywhere,
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.860]   then that's it.
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.060]   So what do we, yeah,
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.780]   'cause then UTC determines when the new day is.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.620]   - And that's going to be tough.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:29.460]   If the date just changes when the sun is halfway down.
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.700]   - Maybe it's a bad idea.
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.020]   It's tomorrow.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.780]   (both laughing)
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.100]   - I do.
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.580]   I do think for business though,
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:43.300]   it maybe would make sense in an email, right?
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.460]   'Cause I always get really confused.
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.980]   They do a lot of calls, obviously, to people in Asia.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.820]   And I'm always having,
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.220]   and sometimes I forget because I'll be like,
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:53.460]   okay, like 830 Monday, but it's like,
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.380]   no, no, that's 830 PM Sunday.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.740]   - Oh, so confusing.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:58.140]   - Right, like you have to remember
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:01.620]   like when that call is actually going to take place.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.820]   So yeah, it's really confusing.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.060]   So it would be helpful to pick it all,
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.260]   just be like, okay, well, this.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.100]   - One time.
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:08.260]   - Yeah, so the same.
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:09.780]   We could start that. - But you had your time as well.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.020]   - We could all, I mean, I always say
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:13.380]   when we talk about the, when we record the shows,
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:15.140]   I always tell people the UTC time,
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:16.860]   'cause there's a lot of time zones,
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.740]   and you have to, I'm not gonna give you every time zone.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.660]   You figure it out.
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:22.540]   - Where is UTC optimal though?
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.580]   Like where does UTC like line up with reality?
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.660]   'Cause it's got a line up with reality,
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.980]   so I'm gonna-- - Greenwich, England.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:27.820]   - Greenwich, yeah.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:28.660]   - Oh, it's England, okay.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.140]   - It used to be Greenwich meantime,
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.700]   they didn't want to make it all about it.
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:33.020]   - Let's not give the British this.
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.100]   I don't think they deserve this.
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:35.100]   - It's not, yeah.
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:38.100]   - UTC, which by the way, stands for nothing.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.660]   The French is C-U-T.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.260]   In no language on the earth is at UTC.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:47.860]   It's coordinated universal time.
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.780]   And in no language on the earth is at UTC,
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.180]   but they just decided,
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:53.540]   because nobody is sufficiently confused,
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.380]   we're gonna call it UTC,
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:59.540]   even though that acronym doesn't work in any language at all.
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:03.620]   So, I don't, the only good thing about this
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.820]   is thanks to technology, I don't have to set as many clocks.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:09.980]   Do you guys, did you have to ebb and wander around the house
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.460]   and set the clocks?
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.060]   - Just the old school ones, yeah.
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:13.900]   - Where you really, really have to--
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.380]   - We have a cuckoo clock,
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.020]   and I don't want to wind it backwards,
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.420]   so I just stopped it for now.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.820]   That was the hardest one.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:24.220]   But it is nice, 'cause all your phone,
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:28.140]   all the devices you use these days to tell the time,
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.220]   all of them know, right,
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.620]   and just fix themselves automatically.
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:32.620]   Even my car knows what time it is.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.540]   (sighs)
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.580]   - My body doesn't, I will go up 5 AM.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:41.500]   - Yeah, it's bad for your physiology and your psychology.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.460]   There are more car crashes on the Monday after.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.020]   I think it's worse going to daylight saving time,
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:49.340]   'cause you're losing an hour.
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.380]   At least we're getting an hour.
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.380]   No, out of sight says--
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:53.220]   - Okay, importantly--
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.340]   - You see, UTC is the French way, it's not.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:58.220]   The French way is, well, anyway.
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:59.500]   Go look it up in Wikipedia,
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.060]   you can see my argument.
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:05.100]   (clears throat)
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.940]   Let's take a little break while we figure out
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.340]   what the hell time it is.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.900]   (laughs)
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:14.900]   Let's take a look back at the week that I wasn't here for.
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:15.780]   How was it, John?
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:18.980]   We made a little video, the best of.
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:21.940]   - Many people know that there's a way to access
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.220]   emergency services with their device.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.820]   You don't know what that looks like,
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:28.260]   what that experience looks like until you do it.
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:31.100]   - I had to try tapping my button five times
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:31.940]   to see what happened,
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.020]   and apparently I had the same thing.
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.500]   No, no, no, no, don't call emergency number.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.340]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:37.660]   - That's your, like, some kind of game though.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:38.660]   (laughs)
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.980]   - Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.820]   - Previously on "Twit," Windows Weekly.
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:48.740]   - And Bill, Microsoft announced this idea of Microsoft Mesh,
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:51.100]   the metaverse for the Enterprise,
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:51.940]   which is very--
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:54.020]   - The meta-prize, if you will.
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:55.580]   - Yeah, yeah, there you go, I like that too.
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:56.900]   - I will not, Paul.
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.580]   (laughs)
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.100]   - Hands-on photography.
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:04.380]   - I have a question sent to me over on the Twitterverse,
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.540]   and it's about NFTs.
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:10.140]   I'm gonna do my very, very best to try to explain
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.460]   this pretty lucrative,
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.740]   yet expensive,
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:14.820]   been technical,
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:17.940]   yet not too technical experience.
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.060]   - Security now.
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:23.540]   - Microsoft said the availability of Windows 11
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.940]   has been increased,
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:29.860]   and we are leveraging machine learning model
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.220]   to offer the upgrade
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.340]   to an expanded set of eligible devices.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.620]   So you've somehow taken an operating system,
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:42.180]   but now it's so advanced
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.900]   that it can no longer run
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.500]   on all Intel-based hardware, only some.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:51.340]   But you don't know where, what, or which,
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:54.940]   to it, nothing about any of this.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.820]   (laughs)
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:59.140]   - You left off the make sense.
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.300]   They cut off his make sense.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.580]   (laughs)
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.620]   I wasn't there for Steve's epic rant against Microsoft,
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:09.180]   but I hear it was a humdinger.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:11.220]   If you haven't watched Security now yet,
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.500]   you might wanna watch it.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.460]   So what did I take to Mexico with me besides my outrageous
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.140]   Mexican shirt that says, "Well, haka,
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.940]   my cowboy hat boots and bolo tie?"
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:25.140]   I took ExpressVPN, our sponsor for this segment
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:26.940]   of this week in tech.
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:30.180]   Going online without ExpressVPN
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:34.300]   is like using the bathroom and not closing the door.
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:37.260]   (laughs)
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.820]   Okay, that's not an image I wanna have in my mind,
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.660]   but in a way it is true because
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:45.140]   you are literally in public
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.660]   when you're going out on the internet.
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:49.900]   Your internet service provider sees every single website
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:53.380]   you visit and we now know from research
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:57.460]   which just recently came out that all the major ISPs,
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.780]   the FTC didn't wanna name names,
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.540]   but all the major ISPs are collecting much more
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:06.140]   than just the websites and it's absolutely legal
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.200]   for them to sell that on the marketers,
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.980]   ad companies, anybody who the highest bidder
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:15.220]   who then use your data to target you,
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:18.140]   close the door and be a little more private.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.980]   That's why I use ExpressVPN.
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:23.060]   Now I was using it for security as much as privacy.
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.140]   There's really three reasons ExpressVPN is a great choice.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:27.580]   Security for sure.
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:30.300]   All your data coming from your computer is encrypted
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:32.380]   all the way out to the ExpressVPN server
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.100]   that means no man in the middle,
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.420]   nobody can see what you're doing
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:36.620]   even when you're on an exposed
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:38.760]   and an open Wi-Fi network, you're safe.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.600]   So that's great.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.620]   It's an encrypted tunnel, a secure, encrypted tunnel
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.620]   between your device and the internet.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.020]   Not only does that protect you against bad guys,
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:50.260]   it means your online activity is invisible to your carrier,
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:51.820]   your internet service provider,
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:54.060]   anybody who wants to snoop on you,
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.420]   they don't know what you're doing.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.220]   And when you emerge on the internet,
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:00.580]   you emerge with an ExpressVPN IP address,
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:03.500]   an IP address shared by other ExpressVPN users.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.940]   So you're just anonymous.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:11.940]   It's also, I have to say, a great way to watch video.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:15.540]   When I was in Mexico, Netflix wouldn't let me watch
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.660]   the movies I downloaded.
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:18.580]   They say they're not available in this country,
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.860]   but one button, ExpressVPN, yes, I can watch it.
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:23.700]   It's a great way to eliminate
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.500]   those kind of regional content protection.
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:29.860]   So privacy, security, content,
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:33.220]   it's also super fast, super secure, but super fast.
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.220]   And that's why I really like ExpressVPN.
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:36.940]   They invest in infrastructure
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.460]   so that they do have enough bandwidth.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.020]   Sometimes people say, "Ah, not GZVPN, it slows me down."
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.420]   Not ExpressVPN.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:45.500]   You can actually put it on your router,
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:49.020]   protect your whole household, and no one will notice.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:50.580]   It's easy to put on any device.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:51.940]   They've got it for everything,
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:56.060]   including smart TVs, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux.
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.740]   You fire up the app, you click one button
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:58.740]   and you're protected.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:02.460]   And I tell you, that kind of protection
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.700]   is worth its weight in gold,
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.140]   but it's not gonna cost you that much,
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.940]   less than seven bucks a month
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:08.500]   when you use our special offer.
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.620]   And I think it's important to pay for a VPN
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.580]   because you want to incent them,
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:15.100]   not to cop, you know, spy on you,
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.660]   not to provide enough bandwidth
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.580]   to constantly rotate the IP addresses,
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.860]   all of the things that a good VPN does.
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:24.260]   And of course, those regular audits
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.180]   to prove that they do live up to their privacy policy,
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:28.500]   they never log you.
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.900]   Their trusted server technology
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.820]   keeps them from being able to log you.
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:36.500]   Secure your online activity by visiting expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:41.500]   eXPR ESS VPN.com/twi.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.500]   T, you'll get an extra three months free
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.140]   when you sign up for a year.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.700]   That's the best deal, big discount,
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:50.460]   expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:51.820]   We thank you so much for the support
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:56.580]   and for keeping us safe as we travel down to Mexico.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.340]   That was a lot of fun.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.540]   I want to, by the way, thank Mike Elgin,
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:01.940]   who's on this show frequently
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:03.100]   and you all know me.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:05.620]   He worked here for some time as their news director,
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:06.780]   his wife, Amira.
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.020]   We did the, and I want to give him a plug,
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.900]   their Gastronomad Adventures.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:15.780]   Mike had been talking about doing this for a long time.
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:19.940]   They've lived all over the world and they've had houses
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.380]   in many, many countries
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:23.420]   and they decided to use their connections
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:26.420]   and their knowledge to take people on experiences.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:28.900]   If you go to gastronomad.net,
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.700]   they do experiences all over the world.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:32.820]   The Provence is coming up Prosecco,
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:34.380]   they're going to do Morocco.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.060]   We did the Oaxaca experience with the day of the day.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:38.620]   That was just incredible.
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.900]   Amira knows everybody.
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:41.540]   We saw that B8, the best food,
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:42.860]   went to the best restaurants.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:43.700]   Met the best chefs.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:45.940]   We had a cooking class that was unbelievable,
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:48.940]   involved catching our own grasshoppers,
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:51.740]   because that's a big part of walking cuisine,
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.180]   it's roasted grasshoppers.
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.180]   They were actually quite tasty.
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.700]   They're going to do Mexico City.
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.100]   They're going to do Prosecco.
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.820]   I think Prosecco is the next one.
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:02.020]   If you want to know more, it was a lot of fun.
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.380]   And I'm not, I paid my way.
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.020]   They didn't give me a freebie.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.380]   I'm not plugging it because I got a freebie.
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:09.780]   I just, because I think these guys,
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:10.940]   I love Mike and Amira.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:13.300]   And I think if you are the kind of traveler,
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:18.300]   like loves food, wine, and wants to get a real experience
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.740]   like a local does of a city,
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.860]   you got to do this Gastronomad.net.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:23.700]   Thank you Mike.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.700]   - What a great brand.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:25.540]   - Isn't that good?
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:26.380]   - No man.
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.100]   - Yeah, he captures both concepts.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.100]   It's a portmanteau.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.860]   That's a great product.
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.260]   - He's been nomadic.
[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.060]   They've been nomadic for a long time.
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:36.740]   In fact, I really had to treat them to come to work for us.
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.420]   They lived in Petaluma for two years while they worked for us.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:41.540]   And when we finally had to let him go,
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:43.020]   he said, thank God.
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.460]   I gotta get back on the road.
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.700]   They don't want to live anywhere.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:52.620]   But they've lived, like they lived over the last say 10, 15 years.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:56.420]   They've lived probably a year in Oaxaca, a year in Morocco.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.700]   They've lived in these places.
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.220]   So they really know them.
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:02.700]   But they don't want to, they're foot loose and fancy free.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.660]   It's kind of neat.
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.460]   I think they're back in the US right now.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.740]   Mike's helping his son Kevin with a chatterbox.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:11.220]   They're doing a big event.
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:12.940]   And then I think they go back out on the road.
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:16.620]   So yeah, it's really cool.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.780]   Had a lot of fun.
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:19.260]   Brought the Pixel 6 with me.
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.020]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.140]   Jason Howell, let me borrow his Google loaner.
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.220]   Google approved it.
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:28.300]   'Cause mine came the day after I left.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:31.500]   So I have now, I have my Pixel 6 and I gave Jason back his.
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:36.740]   But I wanted to try photography with a Pixel 6
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:39.940]   because they're really selling photography.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.300]   And I have mixed feelings about this.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.780]   Any of you have, any of you tried the Pixel 6?
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:46.260]   Are you familiar with it?
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:49.500]   Nope, nobody.
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.220]   I'll show you.
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:55.660]   So one of the things they're really promoting is night mode, right?
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.180]   This night photography.
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.140]   So because it was Day of the Dead, we went to a graveyard.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.620]   This graveyard is lit only by candles
[01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.700]   and you can see some distant lights.
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:08.260]   This is actually the raw version of this.
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:12.620]   And then this is the, you know, the computationally enhanced.
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.980]   And I have to say, does a really good job,
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.260]   especially if nobody's moving,
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:20.020]   which in a graveyard is not so hard.
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:22.940]   But I did like the night vision,
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:26.700]   but I have to say, and I think Aunt Prud has said this as well.
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.180]   Let me see if I can find a good example.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:32.420]   It does a lot of processing.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:35.980]   And in some cases, the images that you get off the Pixel 6
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:40.980]   are kind of, I feel like a little over processed.
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:44.340]   They look like they're oil paintings instead of--
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:47.300]   Do you have to like hold it to like with a night mode?
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:49.700]   Because I think that's so annoying about the newer iPhones
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:52.500]   is like, sometimes like you accept that the lighting is not good,
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.260]   but you like are trying to get that picture, right?
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:57.900]   But you whip it out and if you have it in night mode,
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:59.860]   the exposure needs to be longer, right?
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.180]   And then so you're just sort of like holding it there for a while
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:07.700]   and sometimes then like it gets blurry or like it's just not a super user-friendly experience.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:08.500]   - They do. - To some degree.
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.420]   They do. No, you do want to hold it steady.
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.900]   And if people are moving in it,
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:15.860]   they're going to maybe be a little blurry.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:19.460]   But they, what they're doing is they're taking multiple images.
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:21.020]   I don't know if it's in the Pixel 6,
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:24.540]   if it's still, this is the Pixel 6 Pro, if it's still nine images,
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:27.700]   it was nine images in early versions of the Pixel.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.380]   It's like an AI, right? That it's like a VR.
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:32.420]   And then they do, they kind of do HDR, you know,
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:37.860]   where they take multiple exposures at different F stops and merge them together.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.220]   But then a lot of it is AI.
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.100]   Well, I'm sorry, I'm going, I have so many pictures.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:46.300]   I'm trying to find the one that will illustrate this the best.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:52.500]   I have a picture of Lisa out in the agave fields somewhere around here.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:57.820]   And it smooshes it a little bit.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:01.740]   Now, you only notice that if you Pixel peep,
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:05.700]   if you really zoom in, so this is a good example.
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:08.300]   In this image, it looks pretty good.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.100]   And it is an HDR image because I can tell you,
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:12.940]   not that it was dark, it was daylight,
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:15.540]   but the clouds and everything get great sky detail,
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:18.460]   even though that's much brighter than the shadows in front of me.
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.220]   But you can see detail in all of it.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.820]   But if you zoom in, I don't know if I can actually do this,
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.140]   let me see here.
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.900]   If I zoom in on Lisa, I don't know if I can get close enough.
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:34.100]   Instead of doing what I would expect, which is pixelate it like this,
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.180]   I'm not going to be able to.
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:37.380]   It gets painterly.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:39.500]   It looks like an oil painting.
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:42.100]   I don't know if I can quite show you.
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:46.140]   Yeah, it's not doing it for me.
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:49.460]   If you do it on it, maybe this will show it a little bit.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:50.700]   Yeah, it's a little bit.
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.620]   So look at her hand.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:54.740]   It's a little bit smirry.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:59.700]   Instead of pixelated, the AI is trying to guess pixels.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.660]   And as a result, it's not perfect.
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:09.340]   So I think honestly, everything everybody says about it is right.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:11.540]   It's an amazing camera.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.700]   But it doesn't replace a good camera.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:18.740]   It's great for like Instagram, Facebook, post where you're not going to look
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:22.020]   at the pixels, pixel peep.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.780]   This is a good example because you can see this is the raw,
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:27.780]   and you can see what the original photo had.
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:33.780]   And then what it did to her face, it makes it kind of like a painting.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.060]   It's hard to describe.
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.380]   So Ant Prouts kind of said that with his hands on photography.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:38.700]   I just want to kind of reiterate that.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.200]   He's right.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.380]   There's a lot of computational photography.
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:46.660]   And it is maybe not quite as pleasing, maybe as the iPhone 13.
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:49.340]   I was going to say, oh, this is the best camera ever.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:53.220]   I was thinking that from what people have said about it.
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:56.220]   It's pretty amazing, but it's computational.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:36:01.420]   And it's very much not as natural as you might expect.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.220]   And I think in some ways, the iPhone does a better job.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:08.940]   They're all good, given the fact that it's this little sensor,
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:11.300]   portable device in your pocket.
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:15.940]   Let's not be unreasonable.
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:21.180]   Faulty DRM breaks dozens of games on Alder Lake.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.460]   These new Intel CPUs look very good.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:28.180]   The benchmarks are really impressive, especially
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:30.620]   because Intel's under assault from Apple right now
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:32.540]   with the M1 Pro and M1 Max.
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:36.100]   Alder Lake, their next generation, which is out,
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:37.780]   but probably won't start appearing in computer
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:39.940]   still early next year, is very impressive.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:44.860]   However, however, it does break DRM,
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:51.500]   which DRM is a problem.
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.500]   And apparently, about 50 games, which
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:59.340]   just won't run on Alder Lake machines,
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:01.860]   partly because of maybe the big little design,
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.180]   kind of like what Apple's doing.
[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:09.260]   Intel is pushing out a fix as is Microsoft.
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:13.500]   Intel has a list of 22 games that don't work either on 10 or 11,
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:18.700]   29 more that don't work on 10, but will work if you go to 11.
[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:21.580]   And Intel says a mid-November OS update
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:25.140]   should fix the issue for 11 of those games.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:27.980]   For the rest, Intel has to work with the game developers
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:29.940]   and their copy protection.
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:33.140]   Damn, that copy protection.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:37.020]   So if you're having trouble, I guess the general advice
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:39.100]   is don't be the first to use a brand new chip.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:45.420]   Apple, if you can even get a brand new chip.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:47.420]   If you could get one, don't use it.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:49.420]   I don't know how all these people know it doesn't work.
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:52.180]   I didn't even know you could get an Alder Lake system,
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:54.900]   I guess they can.
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:38:02.540]   Apple has taken a shot at the right to repair movement.
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:07.020]   This is from our good friends at IFixit, former sponsor.
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:10.260]   They call it a screen repair trap,
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.660]   and they say it could change the repair industry forever,
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.380]   apparently, in the iPhone 13.
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:20.300]   If you get third-party screen replacement,
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:24.980]   the iPhone disables its Face ID functionality completely.
[01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:28.700]   We have confirmed this, says IFixit repeatedly in our lab,
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:33.660]   testing with many different phones on iOS 15 and 15.1.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.260]   Others, numerous repair professionals have said this.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:42.220]   IFixit says a dark day for fixers, both DIY and professional.
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:45.260]   One of the most common phone repairs, and by the way,
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:48.220]   it's common because everybody drops these slippery little things.
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:52.020]   That could be done with hand tools, now requires a microscope,
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:56.820]   and you're going to lose Face ID.
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.140]   Comments, thoughts?
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:03.140]   Apple's been historically kind of fighting the right to repair movement.
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.220]   I think you should know.
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:05.900]   I mean, it's a third-party repair.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:09.380]   Isn't this just a continuation of the way they've been all along,
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:12.100]   making it difficult to get into things?
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:16.300]   One kind of window into this is the way the DMCA,
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:20.780]   Digital Millennium Copyright Act has the anti-circumvention provisions.
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:25.980]   And then every three years, there's this process to identify certain exemptions to that,
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:32.100]   things that you can circumvent, and it won't be a violation of the anti-circumvention provisions.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.300]   And I think if you look at the general trend,
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:38.620]   those exemptions have gotten more robust over the years since,
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:44.260]   I guess, 2001 was the first year where there were exemptions because it's every three years for that.
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:47.140]   And there's that, which is, I think, encouraging,
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:53.660]   but it also just seems like the general principle of the right to repair
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:59.740]   is in line with the way our sentiments ought to be in terms of consumer protection.
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:05.220]   The more sophisticated these devices get, the easier it is to be locked out.
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:10.500]   And so I just hope we see a more general trend toward regulation
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:14.660]   that is actually liberating to the consumer and allows there to be more.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.860]   And I think we... Let's remain optimistic that that will happen.
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:19.780]   Apple has always said, "Oh, no, no, no.
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:23.980]   "We're in favor of people repairing their phones, but we're just all about security."
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:27.060]   I fix it, says, "It's hard to understand as a security measure
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:32.060]   "because the face ID illuminator is entirely separate from the screen."
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:36.700]   You can, if you are willing to go through some hoops,
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:39.860]   join Apple's independent repair network,
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:44.700]   which then gives you... It's very much like John Deere.
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:52.500]   It gives you the ability to do the repair and then reauthorize face ID through Apple.
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:57.260]   You have to log in to repair... Log the repair to Apple's cloud servers.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:00.820]   You have to sync the serial numbers of the phone and screen.
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:03.340]   Apple can approve or deny each individual repair,
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:08.020]   and then, if they approve it, your face ID will work.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:10.220]   This is a lot like what John Deere does.
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:14.940]   You can get a third-party repair job on your tractor,
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:20.740]   but unless you have the special John Deere software to authorize it, you can't use it.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:24.460]   And I have to say, I don't think this is about security.
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:28.140]   I think Apple is pretty clearly, and this certainly is a point of view of how I fix it,
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:31.740]   established that they just don't want you repairing your phones.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.540]   They want to do it.
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:35.940]   They don't want their phone.
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:38.340]   Yeah, and I just think it's really concerning,
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:41.740]   especially just with the ubiquity of smartphones now.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:45.340]   I had my car breakdown in the middle of rural Virginia,
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.140]   and I was able to find a really kind of scary,
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:51.340]   but it was a shock rate.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:54.340]   They were able to look at the car and at least establish what was wrong with it.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:42:00.340]   And it was a scary experience, but I wasn't inhibited by my car manufacturer.
[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:02.140]   And I think that that's so important.
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:06.340]   There's so many parts of the country where it is a feat to get to an Apple store.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:10.340]   It might even be a feat to get to one of these licensed repair technicians,
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:13.940]   and it's such a disservice to your customers to make it super difficult.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:17.140]   It's bad for the environment, because a lot of people look at this and say,
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.740]   "Oh my God, it's just so expensive.
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:20.140]   I don't want to pay that price.
[01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:21.540]   I'm just going to get a new iPhone."
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:25.340]   It's going to cost me a third or even half of a new iPhone
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:27.340]   to get my Face ID and screen repair.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:31.340]   It might as well get a new phone and try and recycle the one that I have.
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:36.940]   And that is sort of the incentive that Apple is aligned to.
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:38.140]   And I think that's part of the problem.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.340]   They'll say that's not what we're trying to do,
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:42.340]   but that's clearly better for their bottom line,
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:46.140]   because one of these existential risks that Apple is facing is that,
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:50.340]   remember in 2013 or so,
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:52.940]   your friend would get the new iPhone and you would sort of crowd around them
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:55.140]   and be like, "Wow, they have the new iPhone.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.940]   My iPhone, I feel so out of date."
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.540]   And that's not really the case anymore.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:02.740]   It's sort of slowed down the amount of technological improvement
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:07.540]   between the 12 and the 13 or whatever is a lot less.
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:11.140]   So I think that Apple is incentivized to make sure you get a new phone.
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:14.740]   And one way to do that is to ensure that it's harder to fix it.
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:25.140]   Yeah, there's a... See, Apple seems to be very willing to do things
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:29.140]   that are clearly for their bottom line and then justify it
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:34.740]   with some high-falutin philosophical justification.
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:38.540]   Oh, this repair thing is not for us.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:41.940]   It's not that we want to make money on repairs.
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:45.540]   We just want to keep our users secure.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:50.940]   Greg Federighi gave a speech this week in Portugal at the Web Summit
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:54.940]   in which he said, "side loading," because remember,
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:57.140]   Congress, the EU... Just thinking about this.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:04.540]   And the DOJ, all are... And the courts are all looking at Apple's App Store
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:08.340]   and saying, in fact, in some cases, I think South Korea,
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:12.740]   they're saying you have to allow other third-party App Stores on the iPhone.
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:17.140]   Federighi invokes this whole idea of security
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:18.740]   to protect their business interests.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:21.940]   And Apple, I think that's a very bad road to go down.
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:29.140]   He says, "side loading is a cyber criminal's best friend,
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:34.740]   and requiring that on the iPhone would be a gold rush for the malware industry."
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:37.740]   That one provision in the DMA...
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:40.740]   He's talking about the Digital Markets Act in the EU,
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:45.940]   could force every iPhone user into a landscape of professional con artists
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:49.940]   trying constantly to fool them.
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:52.540]   Okay, tone it down a little bit, Craig.
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:57.140]   And I understand that to some degree that's accurate,
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:59.740]   it is a little more risky to sideload.
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:03.740]   Google's allowed that forever, and they have all sorts of warnings saying,
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.140]   "it's risky," it's so forth.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.940]   Trust your users a little bit more.
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:11.140]   But I think you've got to stop using this kind of rhetoric
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:15.340]   to justify what is clearly just, "I want to make more money.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.140]   We want to make more money. We don't want a third-party-
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:22.140]   Well, that's part of the problem, is that it's often somewhat true.
[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:24.140]   For a while, there was this argument that was like,
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:29.340]   "Oh, well, there's less scams. There's less malware on the Apple Store,
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:33.340]   because we're investing in this really rigorous approval process,
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:36.540]   which other companies like Google don't have."
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.340]   Or like, that was the argument for a long time.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:41.340]   Or, "I can sort of see the really dystopian case.
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:44.940]   Someone buys your cracked iPhone on eBay, and then they restore
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.940]   phase ID, and then they steal all of your information."
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:49.740]   Right? I can see these scenarios they're talking about,
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:52.140]   and there's some kernel of truth there.
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:55.940]   And so it makes it really hard to argue with, and it's really insidious.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.140]   Yeah, just think of the children, child porn, terrible things.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:01.940]   So we're going to spy on you.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:08.140]   I think Apple, it's a bad idea for Apple to do this rhetoric.
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:11.340]   When it's clearly about business interests,
[01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:14.540]   but they're pulling in these things to kind of justify it,
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.940]   it really puts a bad taste in my mouth.
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:19.340]   Am I wrong, Owen? Is this not?
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:21.140]   No, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:27.740]   And I think the folks who are really going to get hurt are some of the few retail businesses
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:31.340]   that have been getting by or even thriving than pandemic.
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:34.140]   You think about all these little repair shops.
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:41.540]   You walk through Chinatown, for example, on the way to our office here.
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:45.740]   And you see all of these little stores, and they used to sell cameras.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:49.140]   The camera market imploded because smartphones took over,
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:51.740]   but now they repair smartphone screens.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:53.940]   And that's good for Apple.
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:57.340]   That's good for Google and Samsung, and everyone selling a smartphone.
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:01.340]   That if your screen gets cracked, it can get repaired.
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:05.140]   I went to an Apple store here in San Francisco and they said,
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:08.340]   "Yeah, we'll charge you, I forget what it was.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.940]   It was like $200.
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.340]   $250, right?"
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:13.340]   Yeah, and it'll take two days.
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:17.340]   Or, by the way, the genius kind of whispered to me,
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.140]   "You can go to one of those repair shops and they'll do it."
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:21.740]   Bad genius, bad.
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:27.140]   Even Apple employees are recommending that you could make sure that you could come knocking on his door
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.140]   buddy.
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:29.140]   Wow.
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:30.140]   I mean, the reality is like, "It's true."
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.540]   It's like, "We need our phones."
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:34.540]   You know, we don't want to be without our phones for two days as ridiculous.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:38.740]   You can't live your life anymore if it's going to be a two-day turnaround, right?
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:45.340]   Right, and that's why this ecosystem of small shops that will do it in an hour exist.
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:51.540]   Here I am in the Oaxaca in the open-air market where they're selling, you know,
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:56.940]   meat and grasshoppers, and here's a guy, just a little booth.
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:57.940]   What's he doing?
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.540]   He's repairing an iPhone.
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:00.540]   Great.
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.940]   It creates jobs.
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.940]   It makes the phone more valuable because you feel...
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.640]   Are you on the damn thing?
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.340]   You should be able to fix it.
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.540]   God, darn it.
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:15.180]   I think Congress actually is starting to pay attention to this whole, you know, right
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:17.140]   to repair issue.
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:21.540]   But it is complicated.
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:24.740]   The companies are, as Louise says, they're putting up arguments that have some...
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:25.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:26.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:27.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:28.940]   You know, repair your iPhone.
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:30.540]   The terrorists win.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:36.140]   I mean, of course, you know, politicians know this better than anybody.
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:39.940]   That kernel of truth supports the whole edifice of lie.
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:40.940]   So make...
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:41.940]   You know, like...
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:45.340]   So, Apple, you know, you've got tens of thousands of smart engineers.
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:47.340]   You could solve something...
[01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:54.640]   Yeah, figure out something that makes, you know, repairability and security not in conflict.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.140]   It just feels like greed to me.
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:58.140]   And here you are.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:02.260]   One of the richest companies in the world, although apparently Microsoft is now worth
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:06.940]   more than Apple, which is a huge surprise.
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:07.940]   What...
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:08.940]   Don't be so greedy.
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:12.860]   It was really like, for me, what really like solidified it for me, how ridiculous this
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:17.140]   was was watching it happen on a state level, because we saw this sort of begin before,
[01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:18.460]   like, Congress started paying attention.
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:21.060]   It was happening sort of state by state.
[01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:25.180]   And the Apple lobbyists would go in and they would really like take some like state lawmakers
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:29.300]   and they would like show them, I think, one of the stories that came out a few years ago,
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:31.100]   Lee, I'm sure you could find this really quickly on the internet.
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:32.740]   I think it was in vice.
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:36.620]   They like said they were to like hurt your fingers on the glass.
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.540]   These arguments were just like really silly that like, people are going to get hurt if
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:41.580]   we allow this, because they're like physically hurt.
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:43.460]   It's like, this is ridiculous.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:46.380]   Like, most people are not going to try and do it themselves.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.380]   I think it's great, by the way.
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:48.780]   I think what I fix is doing is amazing.
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:50.420]   You should try and do it yourself if you can.
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:55.300]   But a lot of people, to Evan's point, are going to go to these small businesses.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:59.540]   My boyfriend and I were in Shenzhen and there was a little straw exactly like that picture.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:01.900]   And I think it took 10, 15 minutes.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:02.900]   It's easy.
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:04.900]   Yeah, it's really not that bad.
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:05.900]   And it was great.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.300]   And I think it costs like, I don't know, like 20 USD or something.
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:09.620]   And then we were on our way.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.340]   I think there's also a case to be made that it's good for the environment.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:13.540]   It's good for humans.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.220]   It's good because make these phones more repairable.
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:20.260]   I just brought the, we've talked a lot about it, the framework laptop, because I wanted
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:26.100]   to support this idea of making something that you could open, repair, replace, upgrade
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.540]   yourself.
[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:31.300]   You could do that with a phone.
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:39.100]   I think it's Apple's decision to make these disposable devices and charge more than $1,000
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.180]   every few years.
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:44.020]   I agreed.
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:47.380]   And I think you could make them more repairable and you should encourage that.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:50.060]   And the problem is that that's what the wealth is built on, right?
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:53.580]   And like now you see Apple sort of making this very conscientious decision to sort of
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.140]   shift to services, right?
[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:59.220]   To shift to like their new gaming product to shift to like Apple new subscriptions.
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:01.820]   Because I think that they realize that that the consumer wants that.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:06.020]   The consumer does not want to buy a $1,000 phone and then need to buy another one in 18
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:07.020]   months.
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.660]   I think we're seeing sort of a revolt to that.
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:11.620]   It does feel like Apple's doing this though because they would like you to buy a new phone
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:14.940]   instead of getting it fixed, right?
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.260]   And they claim and I think it's probably true.
[01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:19.180]   They don't actually make money on repairs.
[01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:22.020]   They probably don't.
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:25.500]   But it sure doesn't send you to buy a new phone.
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:29.780]   I think it's also like just sort of the Apple ethos of that company is that it's always
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:36.420]   sort of been this attitude of like we have a really a lot of control over the product,
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:37.420]   right?
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:38.420]   It's the best consumer.
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:39.420]   You can't go in there.
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.420]   Right.
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:41.420]   It's magical in there.
[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:43.220]   Don't open it up.
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:49.660]   So side loading, cyber criminals best friend because we should choose what apps you can
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.140]   get on your phone.
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:53.300]   No one else.
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:56.260]   Yeah, it doesn't sit right.
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:57.780]   Doesn't taste good.
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:00.580]   And I think it's a bad look in the long run for Apple.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:04.780]   I remember there was kind of a consumer revolt a few years ago.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:10.300]   I noticed, you know, some of my friends, colleagues had cracked screens on their phones.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.300]   Oh, God.
[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:14.580]   Oh, my, oh, my gosh, like, don't you want to get that fixed?
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:15.780]   I really see it.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:16.780]   Yeah.
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:20.220]   Everybody under 30 has a cracked screen.
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:23.580]   My kids don't want me to repair it because they also has so bougie.
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:25.380]   I love it.
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:32.740]   It's such an interesting cultural response to this kind of like, you know, like top down,
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:35.380]   you know, capitalist attempt to control things.
[01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.380]   We're not done yet.
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:38.340]   Couple of final stories to wrap it up before we go though.
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.860]   I want to tell you about Stripe.
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:42.540]   I don't think I have to tell you about Stripe.
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:44.020]   It's the complete payments platform.
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.420]   You know, you use it.
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:46.980]   Everybody uses it.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:52.500]   Leaders of adaptive flexible businesses choose Stripe as their payments platform.
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:53.500]   Why?
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:58.300]   Because with Stripe, your business can easily optimize your payments infrastructure.
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:00.140]   You can simplify your expansion plans.
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:05.500]   You can create new revenue streams all to help you grow and initiate change rather than
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.060]   having to react to it.
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:09.260]   And nowadays, this is the time, right?
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:12.580]   To really start rethinking your processes.
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:17.380]   Businesses like Shopify, Postmates, Twilio, all look to Stripe to power there.
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:23.220]   And I want to emphasize this word, global payments club to it.
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:29.380]   We chose Stripe for a payment platform because it allows us to accept 135 different currencies
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:30.740]   and payment methods.
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:37.660]   It's so flexible, seamless by the way in accepting payments and issuing refunds.
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:39.220]   We just couldn't be happier.
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:41.180]   It is a great payment system.
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:42.980]   Twilio loves it too.
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:44.420]   And this is a real reason to love it.
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:48.980]   They increased their authorization rates by an impressive 10% with Stripe.
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:54.580]   They ran an AB test with multiple global payment processors and chose Stripe.
[01:53:54.580 --> 01:54:01.740]   Stripe helped them generate over $70 million in revenue all by increasing authorization
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:02.740]   rates.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.380]   That's really important.
[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:05.900]   Stripe is easy to use once integrated.
[01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:10.620]   Their single platform and world-class docs allow businesses to easily experiment, to
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:12.980]   scale and grow revenue.
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:18.260]   Stripe processes billions of dollars every year for every size business from little ones
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:22.300]   like us pre-seeds startups to Fortune 500 companies.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:27.060]   Stripe releases hundreds of features and improvements every year to help you stay ahead of industry
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.060]   shifts.
[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:33.220]   And don't worry, as you grow Stripe grows with you, it's completely reliable.
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:40.220]   Five nines of an API uptime, they do more than 250 million plus API requests a day.
[01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:42.060]   So don't worry.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:44.620]   Don't worry as you grow Stripe's there for you.
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:46.060]   They've also invested.
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:49.660]   And I'm always happy to say this in our earth.
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.380]   There's something called Stripe Climate you should look into.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:57.460]   You can direct a percentage of your revenue to help scale emerging carbon removal technologies.
[01:54:57.460 --> 01:55:01.140]   It's very easy as a Stripe customer just to turn that on.
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:02.140]   Please do.
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:03.940]   It's a good thing to do.

[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:26.740]   We've been very, very happy.
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:27.740]   Stripe.com.
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:30.740]   Learn more and get started today.
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:33.740]   What do you think of the great resignation?
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:38.740]   I know this isn't a tech subject, but it kind of is.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:39.740]   Yeah.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:40.740]   I'm part of it.
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:41.740]   So I mean, I have.
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:42.740]   Did you resign?
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:43.740]   Did you say I'm done?
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:44.740]   I don't want this crappy job.
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:45.740]   I'm out of here.
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:48.140]   I'm out just literal economics, right?
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:50.740]   Having some of these jobs became riskier and the market.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:51.740]   Yeah, because of COVID.
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:52.740]   I found for that.
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:59.740]   I think it was also just like I thought about more like how I wanted to be setting my time.
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:01.740]   Like what was the most important thing?
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:02.740]   The quality of life.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:03.740]   Trumps.
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:10.580]   And I think your generation was sold a bill of goods by my generation, by the boomers that
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:15.780]   well, you work nine to five, six days a week, you put in the time, we're going to take
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:16.780]   care of you.
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:20.540]   And then it turned out, no, we're not in fact going to take care of you at all.
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:24.460]   And this is a, this is a, this is in a good life.
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:25.460]   It's not a good life.
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:33.220]   There's a subreddit that I've become addicted to called anti work where people just post,
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:40.540]   you know, all of the nasty things their bosses made them do and quitting and, and
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:43.820]   all of this, here's a, here's a perfect example.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:47.980]   A tweet sick of sick of people saying my generation is poor because we don't work hard.
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:52.460]   My grandpa worked as a janitor his whole life was able to support a wife and five kids
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:53.980]   in a two story house.
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:57.620]   Now if you work as a janitor, you can hardly afford to live by yourself in a one bedroom
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:58.620]   apartment.
[01:56:58.620 --> 01:56:59.620]   That's accurate.
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:05.500]   And I don't blame people saying, I'm fed up at the same time.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:06.500]   You kind of have to work.
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:07.500]   Don't you?
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.340]   You can't just go home and watch TV.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.340]   So I don't.
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:15.020]   I mean, I think about just like how much has changed though.
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:20.500]   I was like reflecting on this other day because when I was 18, I worked with Starbucks.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.980]   And you couldn't even wear like leggings like you had to wear like formal like black dress
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:25.980]   pants.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:28.340]   And I took out my nose ring in the bathroom every day.
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:30.340]   Again, I was 18.
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:32.020]   But now you go in there.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:34.740]   You must have left it in the bathroom because I don't, I don't see it.
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:36.540]   Yeah, I don't, I'm past that stage.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:40.820]   I think I'm past my, my nose ring stage.
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:41.980]   But I'm actually, I'm not.
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:43.300]   Jack Dorsey put us back in.
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:44.300]   Oh, good.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:46.300]   I saw that.
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:47.300]   I mean, I think I have no regrets.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:48.300]   It was definitely a look.
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:51.860]   But, but now you go in there and like they, there's a lot more freedom, but there's a
[01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:52.860]   lot more.
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:55.020]   I think it's also like changing culture is about like tattoos and piercings.
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:58:00.100]   But I, but I noticed on like their little bulletin board, it was like, you know, if
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:04.860]   you, if you refer someone, you get like $700 or something and you see sort of like a lot
[01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:08.700]   more of these companies are trying to accommodate workers.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:09.700]   I think it's great.
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:13.540]   I mean, I think that like there's a better appreciation of labor now because, you know,
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:17.980]   the attitude was definitely you like you should be so grateful to be here.
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:18.980]   Right.
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:22.300]   And I think that now there's a lot, you know, this is a transaction between two people and
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:23.860]   the worker also has power.
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:27.940]   I think is, you know, what this moment is showing us.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:29.900]   And I'm all for it.
[01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:33.860]   I wonder, I wonder how much it has to do with the fact that, you know, the last two years
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:40.620]   will just round up and, and say that has had so much to sort of give us subject matter
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:45.340]   to think existentially, you know, where it could be, you know, getting ill, losing a
[01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:50.140]   job, losing a source of income, having a loved one ill, things going on political.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:58.260]   And so it's, it's been the natural impulse of thoughtful people to reevaluate their purpose.
[01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:04.260]   And that's sort of driving a deeper desire, deeper, you know, guided by a deeper understanding
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:06.780]   to do something meaningful.
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:08.500]   Seems like we've always given lip service to that.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:13.780]   But the context of the last 18 months, two years has really been more of a catalyst to
[01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:18.740]   actually make it happen in principle, not just, not just talk about it.
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:21.300]   And you know, I think the, you know, to tie it to tech.
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:22.300]   I think that.
[01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:23.300]   Yes, please.
[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:25.500]   Great resignation has been otherwise in trouble.
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:26.900]   No, no, no, no.
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:30.260]   But, you know, I think a lot of this has been happening in tech.
[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:35.780]   A lot of it has to do with, you know, remote work and like the idea that like you can now
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:42.260]   get a job, not from like this set of companies in a specific geography, but like any company
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:44.420]   in the world is now bidding for your services.
[01:59:44.420 --> 01:59:50.580]   If, you know, if you're a software engineer or a marketer or, you know, have, have in
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:53.540]   demand skills.
[01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:55.860]   It's also global in China.
[01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:58.380]   It's called the live flat movement.
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:01.740]   So, you know, which is what it sounds like.
[02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:09.140]   Like I am just going to lie down on the floor and like not work because, you know, because
[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:11.540]   in China, especially tech workers are exhausted.
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:13.540]   There's this 996 system.
[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:14.540]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:21.900]   Work from 9am to 9pm six days a week, which actually the government there, the Chinese
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:26.100]   government has been cracking down on it as a labor abuse.
[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:30.060]   But yeah, I think that it's worldwide.
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:32.300]   That's probably what's most fascinating.
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:36.940]   And that's probably, you know, as Evan points out it, it has a lot to do with the pandemic
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:39.140]   that we're all experiencing at the same time.
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:44.340]   It's kind of making us question like, you know, why am I working?
[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:46.180]   How much risk am I taking on by working?
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:48.780]   You know, it's really changed as calculation.
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:56.340]   Well, it's clear that the pandemic exposed some huge fault lines in the economy, in our
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:01:00.940]   country and globally as well.
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:04.860]   I think it's worth noting though that like the line flat movement is also like even bigger
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:06.180]   than just the pandemic, right?
[02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:09.260]   I think it's like to your point, Leo, about like no offense, what your generation may
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:14.700]   be sold some of my generation because I think it's also about like just not wanting to participate
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:16.420]   in this race at all, right?
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:19.060]   Realizing like the idea of like, okay, I'm going to leave my village.
[02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:20.060]   I'm going to move to Beijing.
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:21.940]   It's going to be something better than that.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:25.980]   Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to your point, I went about like the backlash of some of
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:28.100]   this in the government, some of the companies.
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:31.900]   I thought it was interesting that I think it was like within 24 hours, at least 48 hours
[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:37.980]   of sort of this like big shake up at bite dance, the owner of TikTok, you know, the CEO
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:39.140]   is sort of like receding.
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:42.180]   And it seems like one of the very last, you know, things that sort of came down before
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:46.100]   this big executive shake up is that they actually ended working that way.
[02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:49.620]   So now the hours are much more sort of like normal working hours.
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:54.420]   They ended the expectation that you would work nine to nine six days a week.
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:59.660]   And now I think we'll see what the hours are now, but it's like they shorten them to like,
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:01.340]   you know, more normal work hours.
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:04.500]   And I do wonder if that's also part about like retention, right?
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:08.340]   And like being able to keep people in an environment where workers are like, Hey, wait a minute.
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:10.860]   I have a little bit more bargaining power here than I used to.
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:16.140]   Well, it's also the case that during COVID, you saw these billionaire moguls become even
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:18.580]   more rich.
[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:23.940]   You know, it was a big windfall for people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:28.900]   And I have to say there is the other tech angle is that this maybe all began with tech
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:33.940]   workers, particularly engineers who realized they were so valuable to the company that
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:38.540]   they didn't have to put up with crap that they could say, no, we're not going to do
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:39.540]   that.
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:45.180]   I mean, you would have to say, Oh, because it you guys are valuable without you're much
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:49.980]   more valuable because there's a scarcity of talent.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:52.860]   It's not it's not a friction free market.
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:56.620]   Cost us a lot to get new people to train them up to give them stock options.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:58.900]   I think that also is part of it.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:02.140]   It started 10 to seven, 10 to seven, five days a week.
[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:03.140]   That's crazy.
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:04.660]   Are they all the same time zone?
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:05.660]   Yeah.
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:06.660]   Yeah.
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:08.180]   Also remote work.
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:11.140]   It turns out, I mean, no employer wants remote work, right?
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:13.840]   But every employee loves the mind everybody.
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:18.720]   Some people like to the social aspect of coming to work, but a lot of employees are
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:20.380]   going, Hey, this work from home is great.
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:24.140]   Now obviously you can't do that if you're barista at Starbucks.
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:30.660]   But for a lot of people, information workers, you know, I could for sure know that Owen
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:33.460]   and Louise have worked at home a lot.
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:35.300]   I've worked, I could work at home.
[02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:36.300]   I don't.
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:37.300]   I come into a studio.
[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:39.660]   You have to go practice law.
[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:41.460]   Can you just do it at home?
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:43.700]   I've been working in home most of the time.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:44.700]   That's good.
[02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:47.420]   We're starting to reopen, but I like to stay home as much as I can.
[02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:50.420]   Nobody's in a hurry to get back to the office.
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:56.700]   No, I've had some flexibility for a while, but I still think I like look back on the
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:00.620]   fact that I would go to the World Trade Center like multiple times a week and I still get
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:03.060]   like this, I get like that's spooky to me.
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:04.060]   Yeah.
[02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:05.620]   You know, like it still seems crazy that we did that.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:08.420]   That's what you worked for in the World Trade Center.
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:10.700]   That's where Conde Nastas, the owner of our magazine.
[02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:11.860]   The old World Trade Center?
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:13.220]   No, the new one.
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:14.220]   The new one.
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:15.220]   Yeah, not, not.
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:16.220]   Yeah.
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:17.220]   What floor?
[02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:18.220]   That's a question.
[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:19.220]   We moved around.
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:20.220]   I don't even remember what the last floor was.
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:21.220]   It's a hell of a tunnel building.
[02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:26.220]   I'd be a little nervous to be honest to be anywhere in a world, world.
[02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:30.980]   Honestly, I, you would, it was very, very scary with your storms because you would, you
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:34.620]   would, you would be in the eye of the storm and you could feel like a little bit of like
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:36.020]   swaying sometimes.
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:40.780]   And I, during my interview, I was up against like a Florida ceiling window behind me and
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:42.620]   I was like starting to feel sick.
[02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:44.860]   Like, like I was really nervous about my job interview.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:48.860]   I say I got the job, but like, you know, because I would look behind me and it was just like
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:49.860]   so far down.
[02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:50.860]   I don't want to know.
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:51.860]   I'm this way.
[02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:52.860]   Yeah.
[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:53.860]   Right.
[02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:54.860]   Right.
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:04:55.860]   But I.
[02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:56.860]   Yeah.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.980]   I guess I'm the poster child for the, for the new hybrid work style because I, you know,
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:06.780]   I came into our office, you know, mostly so I could, you know, record this podcast with
[02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:07.780]   you, good people.
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:08.780]   Thank you.
[02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:12.780]   You know, and, and, you know, and have a quiet environment and not bug my husband.
[02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:13.780]   Right.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:17.580]   You know, so it was, and it was nice to have the option.
[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:18.580]   That's what I do.
[02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:23.300]   I don't want to, I, you know, I, it's much easier for me to do this in a studio.
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:28.300]   Also, there's a certain something about getting dressed up instead of sex, you know, sliding
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:31.300]   over slippers and jammies to the microphone.
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:33.460]   It's just, there's something like a real person.
[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:36.900]   And I also think there's like, there are like tensions or things that you assume about
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:40.340]   people, like they give off like a different zoom energy and then you need them in real
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:44.580]   life and you're like, Oh, like I made so many like wrong assumptions about how we were
[02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:45.940]   communicating or whatever.
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:49.180]   Like I do think like breathing the same air as people is important, but I don't think
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:52.180]   you need to do it every day, but I really do think that there is some value.
[02:05:52.180 --> 02:05:53.180]   A little bit.
[02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:54.180]   Yeah.
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:55.180]   Yeah.
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:58.780]   So take all the rent and put it into like nice vacations for your whole team.
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:05:59.780]   Yeah.
[02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:00.780]   Yeah.
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:03.300]   What a great panel, Louise.
[02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:05.100]   It's so nice to see you again.
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:07.900]   Congratulations on emancipation.
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:09.700]   Louise Metzakis.
[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:11.300]   Thank you so much.
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:12.700]   Freelance tech journalist.
[02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:18.540]   If you need her, Twitter, L M A T S A K I S on the tweeters.
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:21.580]   Is that a good way to get jobs, get work?
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:22.580]   Just Twitter.
[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:23.580]   Tweet adder.
[02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:25.380]   I got an assignment for you, Louise.
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:26.380]   I think it is.
[02:06:26.380 --> 02:06:30.940]   People come into my DMS, but also my email and stuff is on my profile.
[02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:35.140]   Oh, when Thomas is here, he is now at protocol where he's a senior editor.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:36.740]   Great publication.
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:39.900]   It's interesting when it protocols like a year or two old, right?
[02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:40.900]   It's pretty new.
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:41.900]   Yeah.
[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:45.060]   Actually, we're going to be two in February.
[02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:49.100]   It's weird to have started a business two years ago.
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:53.300]   It was a really strange thing, especially a media business.
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:56.420]   A free media business.
[02:06:56.420 --> 02:07:03.780]   So I joined during the pandemic, but we actually had an in-person event as part of a program
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:04.780]   of in-person events.
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:09.540]   We were planning to have a mixer in San Francisco.
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:13.940]   My colleagues were telling me about how they were handing out drinks and hand sanitizer.
[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:20.260]   And then, of course, like, days later, the world shut down.
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:23.700]   We're starting to hold in-person events again.
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:25.540]   We hosted a dinner in Las Vegas.
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:26.540]   Nice.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:32.500]   It was part of a conference where everyone had to submit proof of vaccination.
[02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:35.900]   So we felt very safe doing it, but it was still kind of...
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:36.900]   Yes.
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:43.460]   I have to say, traveling internationally, which we hadn't done in two years, felt like a
[02:07:43.460 --> 02:07:50.340]   death-defying feat.
[02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:54.780]   Spending an entire day in a mask in an airplane is no fun.
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:56.900]   But in the long run, it felt fairly safe.
[02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:00.140]   We had to get tested before we came back into the U.S.
[02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:02.100]   That was my one where I'm holding my breath.
[02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:03.260]   Please let it be negative.
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:06.660]   Please let it be negative because I didn't want to get quarantined in Mexico for another
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:08.780]   two or three weeks.
[02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:10.140]   And we all tested negative.
[02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:12.500]   We were all careful.
[02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:13.500]   And it felt good.
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:15.820]   It felt good to travel again.
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.980]   Dare I say, it was even fun waiting in the airport just to be out there in the world.
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:22.580]   It was great.
[02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:24.580]   Protocol.com.
[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:25.740]   And it's free.
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:30.780]   It's free, but you should subscribe for extra benefits.
[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:34.860]   Also with this, it's great to have you, Evan, first time.
[02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:36.900]   And you've done a great job, Evan Brown.
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:43.900]   Evan.law at Internet Cases.
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:09:06.700]   Then a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
[02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:14.380]   One in Spain, remember, ruled that they had to pay mandatory payments to newspapers for
[02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:16.780]   search results.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:17.780]   Google said, fine.
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:18.780]   See you.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:19.780]   Guess what?
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:23.140]   Oh, maybe we don't need to do that.
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:28.900]   And Google is now back in Google News is back in Spain after they retract that monthly
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:30.860]   fee requirement.
[02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:40.540]   You know, it just doesn't pay to fight the big goog.
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:44.740]   Tesla had to recall 12,000 vehicles over a software communication error.
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:52.780]   And yet Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world by a significant margin.
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:58.020]   Microsoft's little apps.
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:04.700]   Their Snipping Tool, their Touch Keyboard, their emoji panel stopped working on Halloween.
[02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:09.100]   Microsoft had forgotten to update the certificates.
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:10.100]   Oops.
[02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:14.380]   Voice typing, the Getting Started and Tips section of Windows 11.
[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:15.380]   Here's a tip.
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:17.980]   Keep your certificates up to date.
[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:21.980]   They have tested a patch for the problem with beta and release preview testers.
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:29.260]   And they've now released a fix as of November 5th, an out of band update.
[02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:36.620]   Because you know, when you need the Snipping Tool, you need the Snipping Tool.
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:37.620]   Anything else?
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:38.620]   Did I miss?
[02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:42.460]   There's lots of stories, but I want to make sure we did a quick sweep.
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:46.820]   iPhones apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal, are going to start adding detection
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:48.460]   for car crashes.
[02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:51.900]   And they will auto dial 911.
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:53.260]   They could possibly go wrong.
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:58.940]   I actually had somebody call me who went over a bump in his truck and his watch started
[02:10:58.940 --> 02:10:59.940]   calling 911.
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:02.100]   They said, "You've taken a terrible fall."
[02:11:02.100 --> 02:11:04.380]   I said, "No, no, no, you haven't."
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:10.380]   They usually give you a minute or two to cancel that out.
[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:13.780]   I think we can wrap this up.
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:17.180]   Any stories you guys are covering, you think are important?
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:20.380]   I think we covered all the big things.
[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:23.180]   I don't want to keep you too much longer.
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:24.980]   Louise, thank you so much.
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:31.460]   Congratulations again on your emancipation from the giant Condi Nast.
[02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:33.580]   Onwards and upwards.
[02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:34.580]   We always think you're great.
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:36.660]   You're always welcome here, Louise Metzakas.
[02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:37.660]   Thank you for being here.
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:38.660]   I appreciate it.
[02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:39.660]   And you know what?
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:41.220]   You can leave your nose ring on if you want.
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:42.220]   I don't.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:43.220]   You don't have to.
[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:44.220]   I appreciate that.
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:45.220]   It's okay.
[02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:46.220]   It's okay.
[02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:50.060]   Hey, if Jack Dorsey can do it.
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:52.060]   Anyone should be able to.
[02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:54.820]   Owen Thomas, I think you never had a nose ring.
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:56.580]   I'm just guessing.
[02:11:56.580 --> 02:11:58.140]   But it does look like you have a faux hawk.
[02:11:58.140 --> 02:11:59.140]   So I don't know.
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:00.140]   Is that...
[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:02.580]   I actually had an earring in this ear.
[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:03.580]   Earrings, okay.
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:07.860]   Probably in the Silicon Spin era.
[02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:09.860]   There might be video evidence.
[02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:10.860]   There's video of you.
[02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:11.860]   I bet.
[02:12:11.860 --> 02:12:12.860]   Yeah.
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:14.420]   Owen, it's great to see you.
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:15.500]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:16.660]   We always appreciate it.
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:18.300]   Protocol.com.
[02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:20.500]   And Evan, you did great.
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:22.540]   Evan Brown on The Big Show, everybody.
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:25.820]   Ladies and gentlemen, what do you plug something?
[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:26.820]   Are you...
[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:27.820]   What are you up to these days?
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:29.340]   It's been a long time since we've talked.
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:30.340]   Yeah.
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:32.820]   Well, I try to blog when I can at Evan.law.
[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:34.980]   Follow me on Twitter down there in the lower third.
[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:38.860]   You know, I have just been really busy working with wonderful clients.
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:41.300]   You know, about 80% of my clients are technology companies.
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:45.500]   The other 20% are in all industries bringing in some kind of technology solution.
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:48.540]   So it's just a wonderful time for innovation.
[02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:54.260]   And I love working with the creative and, you know, innovative people that I deal with.
[02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:59.420]   So, you know, I'm just out there fighting a good fight, negotiating deals, resolving
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:02.260]   disputes, doing that kind of...
[02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:04.260]   Doing lawyer stuff.
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:05.260]   Lawyer stuff.
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:06.260]   Lawyer stuff.
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:07.260]   Yes.
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:08.260]   Great to see you.
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:09.260]   It was really fun having you on again.
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:13.100]   We missed this week in law, of course, and I miss your presence on the show, but we'll
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:14.740]   get you back here real soon.
[02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:15.740]   We appreciate it.
[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:16.740]   I hope so.
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:17.740]   Looking forward to it.
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:18.740]   Thank you so much.
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:23.740]   Thank you all for joining us, especially thanks to our Twit Club members who help support the
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:25.380]   efforts here.
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:30.300]   $7 a month gets you an ad-free version of every one of our shows, plus you get access
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:37.820]   to the wonderful discord, the power of the animated GIF and the Twit Plus feed, which
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:39.620]   always has something interesting on it.
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:42.460]   At least I needed a special inside Twit for it.
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:44.380]   Steve Gibson didn't ask me anything.
[02:13:44.380 --> 02:13:47.700]   You've got lots more great ideas coming up.
[02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:52.140]   As Joe says in the discord, "Join us.
[02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:53.500]   Join us."
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:56.660]   Just go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:13:56.660 --> 02:14:01.740]   It's a great way to support our efforts here, and we really appreciate it.
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:02.740]   We're working.
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:08.340]   I don't know what that one has to do with anything, but that's a good animated GIF.
[02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:13.540]   It says a lot.
[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:19.220]   For those just listening, for some reason unknown, there's a kid hanging upside down
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:24.100]   in his swing and running his hair through a mud puddle as he swings back and forth.
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:25.580]   No one knows why.
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:27.340]   It's just part of the fun.
[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:31.660]   It's a really deep metaphor.
[02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:34.460]   There's also another way to get ad-free versions of the shows.
[02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:37.820]   We've also turned on subscriptions on Apple's iTunes.
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:39.540]   As you may know, they have their own.
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:40.540]   It's audio only.
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:43.100]   They have their own subscription platform, $2.99.
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:47.820]   If you just want one show, this show or security now, whatever, just one show, you can subscribe
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:49.940]   to that for $2.99 a month.
[02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:54.060]   We do this show, and everybody's invited to watch us do it live.
[02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:59.540]   We have a live feed every Sunday afternoon, $2.30 Pacific, $5.30 Eastern, $2.130.
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:03.900]   Oh, no, I have to change that, don't I?
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:05.620]   It's $20.30 UTC.
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:08.380]   I think that's right.
[02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:10.300]   The math always throws me.
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:13.300]   It's twice a year.
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:14.300]   I've got to figure that all out again.
[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:18.460]   If you want to watch us live, there's a live stream, audio or video at twit.tv/live.
[02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:24.300]   You can chat with us for free, absolutely free, in our chatroom, irc.twit.tv.
[02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:26.060]   Always great people in there.
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:28.860]   Of course, there's a great Discord chat going on too.
[02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:38.820]   It has one thing that the IRC chat does not animate in GIFs, and that makes all the difference.
[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:44.580]   So the fact shows, all of our shows are available, whether you want to go to our website, twit.tv.
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:47.060]   There's a YouTube channel for every show.
[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:48.740]   You can watch the video there.
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:52.820]   Of course, the easiest way to get a subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:55.540]   And if you do, would you do us a favor?
[02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:57.340]   Tell the world about Twit.
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:15:58.580]   Leave us a five-star review.
[02:15:58.580 --> 02:16:02.660]   Let the world know about the goodness that is this week in tech.
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:10.580]   I think the longest-running, continuously-running tech podcast, or at least one of them, we've
[02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:13.020]   been doing this since April 2005.
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:15.460]   That's a good long time to be doing a show.
[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:16.460]   Thanks for being here.
[02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:20.980]   I'm going to say it again for the, what is this, 848th time.
[02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:22.980]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:23.980]   Have a great week.
[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:24.980]   We'll see you next week.
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:27.560]   (hip hop music)
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.140]   (hip hop music)
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:32.720]   (hip hop music)
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:34.720]   Do it the twit, baby.
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:36.100]   [music]
