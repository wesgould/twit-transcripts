[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Gathered around the Twit table today, virtually via
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.240]   the internet, the internet webs.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.520]   Jason Calicanis hasn't been on for a long time
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.360]   from mahalo.com.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.200]   Hi, Jason.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200]   It's great to be back.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.560]   I'm assuming that the people who refuse to be on the show
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.480]   with me are not the other guests.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.560]   You can by deduction.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.040]   It's become a little bit like Clue.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.360]   I know who it is. It's a DRM war.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.120]   You know, it's funny because there are little relationships
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.920]   here and there, and there are little people who,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.400]   like Adam Curry doesn't mind being on with Dave Weiner,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.120]   but Dave Weiner doesn't want to be on with Adam Curry.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.280]   Things like that.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.880]   And I think that they're just minor things.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.680]   And Audible doesn't want to be on with Corey Doctorow.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.880]   Things like that.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880]   Right.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.200]   So I'll be on with anybody anytime to talk about any stuff.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.560]   Somebody send me--
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.840]   I made a joke Twitter post saying the ideal Twit panel
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.240]   would be all these people who hate each other,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.120]   including Adam and Dave and you and Corey and a bunch of people.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.040]   And then Paul Kent from Macworld sent me a note saying,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.560]   you want to do that panel at Macworld?
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.680]   I said, if you can get those guys to show up on stage,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.520]   I would love to do that panel at Macworld.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   How to do that.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.080]   Let's work for it, Jason.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.840]   I'm so in.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.080]   The battle of the internet super-egos.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.440]   It'd be great.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   Genius.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.840]   It'd be really fun.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.560]   Also here, Molly, would you hear in the background?
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.200]   It was too cold to go to make her fair today,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   so she broke her kid's heart and joined us at Twit.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.680]   It was.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.600]   It's true.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.080]   I feel like I'm doing something wrong,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.640]   because I haven't heard that anyone refuses
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.200]   to be on the show with me.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.960]   That seems like a badge of honor of some sort.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.760]   You're absolutely right.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.160]   There is no one has yet said that,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.280]   Molly would, I won't be on a show with her.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.440]   I'm a total failure as an internet super-ego.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.480]   You know, come to think about it.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.840]   They're probably people who say, I won't do Twit because of me.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.560]   So there you go.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.240]   Whenever Leo doesn't host Twit, I'll be there.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.320]   Yeah, I'm sure that happens.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.080]   Also Will Harris, who we love,
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.560]   and we haven't had him on an age either.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.840]   In fact, this is really kind of a reunion,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.760]   because a bunch of you haven't been on in a while.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.560]   I'm so glad to get you on Will Harris.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.960]   It's middle of the night in Oxford, but he's here.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.360]   It is, and I am.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.040]   Hello.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.960]   And you know, we're doing something fun with both Jason
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.880]   and Will, because we're now stream,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.560]   we will stream Twit Live video every week at TwitLive.tv.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   And this is the first time I've had YouTube guys on Nvidia.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.400]   Molly can't get on.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   Stick 'em's not.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.360]   It's broken for her.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.200]   She is. She has a shield.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Ooh.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.040]   Ooh.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   I don't know.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   The whole thing just died.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.880]   I mean, the whole thing just died.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.040]   The whole thing just died. What happened there?
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.200]   It wasn't just me, right?
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.440]   The whole thing just blanked out. Yeah.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.280]   Stick 'em out.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.520]   I did. I think you killed it, Leo.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.160]   I did, 'cause you know what I did just about two minutes ago
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.760]   as I posted on Twit Live.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.680]   We do post when we're gonna be on on Twitter.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.320]   There's a Twit Live.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.040]   You follow Twit Live on Twitter, among other places.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   And I just posted it two minutes ago,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.480]   and I think we just like 8,000 people just signed on.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.880]   But it's up now. It's back up now.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.960]   So that's fun.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.200]   This is, look, cutting edge, baby.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.040]   I also twitted it, so between the two of us--
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.320]   Oh, you did it. Well, no wonder. That explains it.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.640]   Well, you have more than me now.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.160]   No, but I had Twitter on my regular account.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.680]   I have a special Twit Live account, so.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.280]   You drunk my milkshake.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.000]   I didn't do it intentionally, Mr. Callicanis.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.720]   All right, you and Kevin Rose will be--
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.360]   Rose is on the way. Rose is. Rose--
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.440]   The real question for me, the only question in this horse race,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.800]   and we're not gonna talk about Twitter this week,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.720]   except this one thing, the real question in the horse race is,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.840]   can I beat Barack Obama before Kevin Rose beats us both?
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.800]   Good question.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.600]   I'm only 500 or 600 back now.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.680]   But Kevin's coming on still.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.320]   Why are you running for president?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.480]   This is better than Kentucky Derby.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   I just don't why I don't break my ankles.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.720]   A very least you should run for, you know,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.040]   president of the internet.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.200]   I would be a good president of the internet.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.440]   I would come out for net neutrality for all.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   I would say Comcast and Rogers must go out of business.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.640]   What else should we do?
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.800]   Actually, I shouldn't, 'cause I just got my Comcast cable.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.000]   That thing is fast. You guys have that burst yet?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.680]   22 megabits down, three megabits up.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.880]   I am using all the meager juice I have
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.480]   to basically get Verizon to put--
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.320]   A Fios.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.160]   A Fios.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.720]   And I'm like, I got like the inside people at Verizon
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.800]   trading emails with them.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.320]   I'm like, okay, here is the deal.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.480]   You guys get me Fios.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.760]   I will blog about it every day.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.400]   I'll Twitter about it every day.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.600]   I'm like willing to do anything to get them
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.720]   to put it into my house.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.600]   And they're like, we totally want you to be our spokesperson.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.640]   We're gonna get it into your house.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.720]   Wow.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.160]   But wait a minute, don't you live in Brentwood,
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.400]   like the richest sector section of Hollywood of LA?
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.720]   I mean, don't, I mean--
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.440]   It is the most expensive zip code in the country.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.640]   Why don't they have Fios there?
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.760]   I mean, you know, you--
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.480]   Fios there.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.800]   I don't know, Leo.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.560]   It's insane because they could charge people a thousand
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.800]   dollars a month and they would pay it.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.600]   Ted Danson alone would pay for the bill right there.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.640]   The governor lives from there and the people--
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.280]   Well, heck yeah, if the governor doesn't--
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.440]   But the people want the high speed broadband.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.160]   They want the broadband.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.480]   You have to give it to them.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.080]   I think this is almost as fast as Fios though.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.520]   22 meggs down, no, I guess it's not.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.880]   You get 50 with the Fios, don't you?
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.720]   You know what?
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.120]   Oh, hey, I'm up.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.200]   Oh, hey.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.080]   Molly's up.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.960]   She's got an account.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   OK, I'm on stop.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.680]   I'm now doing some--
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.640]   Just look at the L.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.160]   She's on the stick.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.800]   She's on the stick.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.680]   So did you friend me?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.880]   You have to ask to be my friend.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.280]   Then you get in the chat room.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.160]   I automatically friend you back.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.280]   Then you go to the chat room.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.800]   And once you're in the chat room, turn on your video.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.000]   And then we will put your video up.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.360]   And then we will be complete.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.000]   And then we will be whole.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.080]   I don't even know if I can figure out how to friend you.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.840]   So is there anything--
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.120]   Oh, friend request.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.440]   Say again, Jason?
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.160]   I was wondering if there was anything
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.360]   in the news this week.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.160]   You know, nothing happened.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.080]   It was really kind of a slow--
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.280]   Yes, there was a story.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.040]   There's a big story.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.680]   So this is a great story.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.320]   I'm going to give you kind of the quick and dirty synopsis
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   and then we can talk about it.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.720]   It starts on Thursday.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.000]   And we know this because Silicon Valley Insider
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.520]   sneaks into the Microsoft All Hands meeting.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.400]   Must have gotten a phone number from somebody inside.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   So he calls and he listens.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.760]   And Steve Ballmer says to the troops, well,
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.160]   about this Microsoft Yahoo thing,
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.640]   we think you're going to hear something later tomorrow.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.680]   So hang in there.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.760]   Stay tuned.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.240]   Something will happen tomorrow.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.120]   So they publish this on the Silicon Valley Insider.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.480]   And that's a good scoop.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.960]   And everybody's, you know, Karish Wisher
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.720]   and everybody's kind of speculating wildly.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.560]   What will it be?
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.920]   Will they raise the stakes?
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.520]   Will they go hostile?
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.880]   You know, Microsoft bid or offered $31 a share.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.560]   Yahoo's board turned him down.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.760]   Last week we said that, you know,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.280]   his self-imposed deadline, midnight,
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.600]   a satellite passed with nothing, no word.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.640]   So Microsoft Friday raises its offer $33 a share,
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.920]   44.something billion dollars for Yahoo.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.880]   Yahoo's response?
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.080]   No, we're worth $37 a share.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.680]   So today Steve Ballmer sends a note to the troops
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.200]   saying we're walking away.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.040]   That's it.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.320]   The Microsoft Yahoo merger over.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.960]   - That's pretty useful.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.800]   - Or is it?
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.720]   - What are, or is that's the end?
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.040]   - Okay, it's story over.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.880]   - It's never known.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.800]   Right, but if you were Steve Ballmer
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.840]   and you actually wanted a hostile takeover of Yahoo,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.960]   what would you do?
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.520]   You'd walk away from the deal,
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.080]   you'd watch the share price tank
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.640]   and then you'd come back in a week later
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.520]   when you pick it up at 25 bucks a share.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.000]   - Interesting.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.840]   - I can't--
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.680]   - Yeah, I've seen a lot of that speculation.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.040]   I just feel like Ballmer, if anything,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.000]   you mentioned before the show that you thought he had,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.200]   you know, big ones.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.920]   But I felt like when they go and got tough,
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.640]   Microsoft didn't know what to do.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.400]   I mean, I honestly read this whole situation
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.520]   as Microsoft thinking that when they went in
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.400]   with their offer for Yahoo, that they would be greeted
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   as liberators and that as soon as Yahoo started
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.560]   putting up some resistance, Microsoft sort of panicked
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.840]   and you know, where they were like,
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.080]   well, we really don't want to go hostile
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.360]   'cause we don't know we're not prepared for that at all.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.240]   - Well, I don't think they did want to go--
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.880]   I don't think they did want to go hostile, hostile
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.520]   because then you piss off engineers and executives
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.920]   and you don't want a company that doesn't want
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.400]   to be part of you, right?
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.440]   Jason, you said, what do you think?
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.240]   - Well, I was absolutely convinced it was going to happen
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.840]   and I think the one thing that a lot of people didn't
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   anticipate was that Yahoo's leadership,
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.800]   specifically Jerry Yang, would basically do so many
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.720]   poison pills, basically was so adamant
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.360]   that they'd not be sold.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.680]   So he basically put it at a price that I think--
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.520]   - It's a major school state.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.000]   It's a major scorched earth threatening to do the Google deal,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.400]   threatening to go open search
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.800]   and let anybody have the search results.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.280]   I mean, all these things they were doing
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.000]   were basically to decrease the value of the asset.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   So Microsoft wouldn't want to buy it.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.360]   Now they've succeeded.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.520]   It's going to be a total bloodbath this week
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.440]   on the stock price.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.680]   I mean, it's going to go crashing back down
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.000]   and there's going to be a lot of shareholders
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.840]   who are like, what happened?
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.080]   We would have liked the $33.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.440]   And if Google shares stay at 20 or 22
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.000]   for another two or three years, which is completely possible,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.120]   or they could go down, there's going to be a lot
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.080]   of upset hedge fund, you know--
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.920]   - Lawsuits?
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.920]   - Institutional, oh, there's going to be a ton, of course.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920]   I mean, absolutely.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.760]   - Absolutely.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.520]   - It's going to be just a total mess.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.440]   And I basically made a list of people
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.960]   and if who won in this, you know, Google's big winner.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   Google's a big winner.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.920]   - This is what Google wanted.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.240]   This is why Google kept throwing little bones to Yahoo's
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.560]   saying, come on, you're worth more than that.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.400]   Come on.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.360]   I mean, you can just see Google behind the seat
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.200]   that you're worth more than that.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.560]   - Are you going to take that from that guy?
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.200]   - You can listen to that, Paul.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.040]   (laughs)
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.680]   - Huge winner.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.280]   The VCs and the startup companies, huge winners.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.720]   Better to have three buyers out there for buyers out,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.520]   you know, better to have three than two, right?
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.560]   In the search business, so it's much better for VCs
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.440]   and for startup companies.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.760]   For the Yahoo shareholders, they're major losers
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.400]   because they could have gotten 50% premium or more.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.600]   It was actually like a 70% premium at this point
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.640]   on their shares today.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.240]   So they could take that 70% gain
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.160]   and go put it somewhere else and make more money.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.360]   - Of course, you know, if I were a Yahoo shareholder,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.600]   you know, the bid itself raised the Yahoo stock price,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.240]   10 bucks.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.800]   Maybe the smart thing to do, we just sell right now.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.160]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.200]   - In fact, sell as soon as the month.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.440]   - I wonder what the after hours prices are.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.920]   You know, let's get to Andrew Horowitz on.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.320]   I don't know if you know Andrew.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.760]   - I'm going to dial him up right now.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.600]   - He does a podcast called The Discipline Investor.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.440]   He's written a good book called The Discipline Investor,
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.120]   a smart guy who might know a little bit about this as well.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.400]   Andrew, are you there?
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   - Hello Leo, how are you?
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.240]   - Hi Andrew.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.600]   - Say hi to Jason Calicanis, Molly Wood, Will Harris.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.440]   - Hello, hello.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.640]   - What is the, is there after hours trading a free Yahoo
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.440]   and what is the current price on that?
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.040]   - Well, the after hours trading really is more
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.560]   of an indication these days.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.360]   You're going to see it around the world
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.120]   and but we're seeing indications
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.800]   somewhere in about the $22 range is going to be the,
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.280]   the open, the US open.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.760]   - It was what under 20 when, before this bit happened.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.920]   - We've got 19 bucks and a shot up to almost 31
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.960]   and on Friday it went up to about 28 and 29.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.720]   - Seems to be the consensus so far of the panel.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   I'd like to know what you think Andrew,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.760]   that this is in effect a hostile takeover attempt
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.640]   by walking away. - Yeah, it's intense.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.560]   - Right, well, you know, listen, I don't think that--
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.680]   - It's a passive, it's a passive aggressive takeover attempt.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.480]   - Yeah, I mean, this, this an Obama has been very clear
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.560]   that and he's looking to take this over.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.880]   He's looking to get into this, this,
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.520]   Yahoo world if you will and Yahoo is just not playing.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.120]   And if they're not going to play by the rules
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.360]   that, you know, traditional business lays out,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.720]   well, we're going to have a push me pull me, I guess.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.360]   You know, it's going to kind of go out after it
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.760]   in a different way and maybe turn the Yahoo shareholders
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.120]   against Yahoo.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.480]   They're not going to be happy about this.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.800]   - Well, that's what you were saying, Jason.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.960]   There's going to be lawsuits that'll be pissed.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.120]   - Yeah, it's a disaster for that.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.680]   But was there anything Microsoft could do?
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.920]   I guess they could have accepted, they could have said,
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.240]   okay, we'll give you a 37 bucks.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.960]   Why didn't Microsoft raise the offer?
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.800]   Why did they stop at 33?
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.640]   - Well, it's like the five billion on top.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.360]   - It's another five billion, I mean, Microsoft
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.760]   take loans out to do this and then if it,
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.080]   you know, they don't want it to turn into another AOL
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.640]   time-water situation.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.000]   - So, okay, so let's say that Yahoo is a Ford Torino
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.920]   and I got a Ford Torino and I put it on the market
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.840]   and Joe Microsoft comes along and says,
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.360]   "I'll give you 31 bucks for it."
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.760]   And I say, "No, dude, it's worth 37."
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.640]   He said, "No, all right, I'll give you 33 bucks."
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.840]   No, dude, it's worth 37.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.880]   Why don't they say, "Let's split the difference."
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.160]   - Well, they tried that.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.440]   They tried to talk about, you know,
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.760]   changing around, you know, upping the bid
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.960]   but the fact is the culture at Microsoft number one is
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.400]   they don't want to take out debt, Jason.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.880]   I mean, right, that Microsoft is not going to want
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.760]   to start taking on debt.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.640]   They have plenty of cash laying around.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.880]   You know, they could do this deal.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.080]   It could work out for everybody.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.680]   They're talking about synergies.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.000]   You know, there's big opportunity
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.200]   but they're not going to put themselves in a hole,
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.480]   especially the time when credit and debt
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.880]   has such a bad name for it.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.360]   - So, okay, so now it's like a co-op
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.720]   and it's not just me that owns the Ford Torino.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.040]   Five of us own the Ford Torino
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.400]   but I'm the one talking to you.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.360]   So what you're saying is by walking away,
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.320]   the other four guys go, "We had 33 bucks in that pocket
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.720]   and you just walked away, we got nothing now."
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.440]   Now, if you go hostile,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.120]   I guess this is a good way to go hostile
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.640]   because the only people are going to get upset here,
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.240]   the shareholders, what about the engineers?
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.480]   What about the mind, the brain power at Yahoo?
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.600]   I mean, isn't that what you're buying?
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.400]   Is the talent pool, how do they feel about all this?
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.400]   - From a financial standpoint,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.200]   I mean, don't you think that they're going to be upset
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.000]   but the reality was there was an underpinning of,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.560]   you know, hostility on that side.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.040]   I mean, Yahoo and Microsoft
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.400]   don't have exactly the same culture at all.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.800]   - Yeah, I wouldn't want to work at Microsoft
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.960]   if I'm a Yahoo guy.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.000]   Jason, you must have some insight,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   a little bit of insight into this.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.480]   You must know some of the people involved.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.040]   - It's going to be a very mixed bag.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.880]   There are people who are Yahoo
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.120]   who absolutely can't stand the fact that Yahoo can't focus
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.680]   and that they've got a million brands
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.760]   and Yahoo photos versus Flickr, they buy delicious,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.120]   they start another bookmarking service,
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.160]   all those sort of like lack of leadership
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.000]   at the top kind of problems they had
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.160]   under Terry Semolak of software focus.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.920]   And really that's what Yahoo was good at.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.920]   They were really like a software company in many ways
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.840]   in addition to search and advertising.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.680]   Those people I think are just frustrated
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.800]   that the company's just not making great product.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.360]   Some of them might have thought, you know what?
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.440]   Under new leadership, it might have gotten better
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.960]   because this kind of sucks, you know,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.120]   the situation we're in currently.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.160]   But, you know, it really creates tremendous anxiety
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.680]   inside of companies and paralysis
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.600]   when these talks are going on like this.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.000]   And I think that was also a decision
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.400]   or a major factor for Steve Bomber.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.880]   This was creating massive anxiety inside of Microsoft.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.680]   And I just think they were like, you know what?
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.520]   This isn't worth it.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.640]   We have a bunch of people here are saying,
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.040]   why are we spending all this money?
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.320]   Give us five, just the difference that Yahoo wanted.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.840]   You give them five billion dollars.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.400]   You could buy Dig, LinkedIn.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.560]   I mean, you could buy a massive footprint
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.600]   of 50 million, 75 million web-based users.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.000]   And then a couple of ad networks
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.840]   and all of a sudden for five, 10 billion, you could buy.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.360]   - A lot less money.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.480]   - Do you think it ever truly became clear
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.880]   why Microsoft wanted Yahoo in the first place
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.360]   when all of those other things were on the table?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.360]   When Pupino Wired had that great article this week
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.320]   about how Microsoft should set its sights on AOL
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.880]   because it's so much cheaper.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.200]   And if they really want content
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.480]   and they really want good URLs,
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.560]   then that's what AOL has to offer.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.640]   - They want the ad network.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.520]   And that's the crown jewel of all this
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.280]   is they want to have like the ad network
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.320]   and the search market share.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.160]   Those two pieces.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.360]   - Talking about 20, 22% up they'll have
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.560]   compared to AOL is only offering about 5% on the search.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.400]   And then the ad is not even near that.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.280]   But I think there's another point here.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.520]   You've been noticing as much as maybe
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.640]   you don't want to kind of maybe say Microsoft
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.920]   is getting a bit hipper.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.080]   You know, if you see their site,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   they're changing from kind of a squared to a cornered,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.920]   a nice beveled edges and they're kind of coming in
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.240]   with a little bit of a different edge.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.160]   I mean, I think there's something to be said
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.880]   about the fact that Microsoft has missed the boat
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.800]   on the online community, you know,
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.240]   where they have office products,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.760]   they have your computer taken over.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.160]   They missed the boat on the last two generations
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.280]   and they're looking to the next online
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.200]   and text messaged and mobile generation.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.160]   And they figure that if they can get this massive eyeballs,
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.200]   if they can come in and just kind of swallow up
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.320]   the number one site, you know, on the web,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.280]   they can do a lot with that.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.880]   - So I'm confused, are they buying eyeballs?
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.680]   Are they buying engineering talent?
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.880]   Are they buying an ad network?
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.720]   What are they buying?
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.560]   - I don't think the buying is a hearing talent.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.400]   - But that comes down to what you think Yahoo is.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.840]   I mean, Yahoo itself is so like schizophrenic
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   as a company and a brand and a property, you know,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.240]   it's search and it's sort of hardcore geek stuff,
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.520]   like sort of flicker and delicious when it started.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.640]   It's super hip, cool, web 2.0.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.240]   But then it's like Yahoo chat and Yahoo I am,
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.560]   which are kind of like really mainstream
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.360]   and kind of slightly early norties.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.960]   But then they've got like this content thing
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.240]   where they want to start developing their own content brands
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.600]   and then they've got like an ad network,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   but they're also pushing out their ads
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.160]   to sort of content people that are competing
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.080]   with their own content brands.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.440]   - Yeah, I guess that's like, that's the thing that's--
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.280]   - What is in there?
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.120]   You know, what is Yahoo's--
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.960]   - Yahoo's biggest.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.680]   - A web company. - A web company.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.480]   - Yahoo's biggest problem is that it doesn't know
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.760]   what it is. - No problem.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.800]   - And then the biggest thing that didn't make sense
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.000]   about Microsoft trying to buy Yahoo,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.680]   and I'm not, I am firmly in the camp of believing
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.720]   that it's still a possibility and that certainly
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.600]   the shareholder response like Jason said
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.400]   is gonna be strong enough that a deal may get done after all.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.160]   But the thing that still doesn't make sense
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.360]   is that if you want the ad network, that's a really,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.640]   that's a lot of overhead to buy just to get an ad network.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.880]   And I understand that the ad network would add a lot
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.560]   over something like AOL, but could not want it.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.840]   - You guys think smaller and build on it?
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.560]   - Here's the thing is once advertiser,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.560]   you need to have a big footprint
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.760]   to get these big ad budgets.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.280]   So at AOL, AOL has a pretty big footprint.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.880]   Yahoo can sell that main page for a lot of money,
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.440]   millions of dollars a day.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.480]   You know, you can really start doing these,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.320]   you know, nine figure ad deals, you know,
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.520]   and certainly five figure ones.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.360]   And you can't do that with a small base,
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.200]   no matter what you do.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.240]   And it takes a long time to build it.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.480]   So there were really, there was three pieces they were buying.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.720]   They were buying the search market share,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.840]   which immediately makes them, you know, a distant second,
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.120]   but not out of the race second.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.240]   The ad network, which makes them a second.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.040]   And they were buying thousands of engineers at once.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.920]   And Microsoft likes to build stuff
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.600]   and they're good at iterating.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.240]   And you really can't discount them.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.120]   I mean, look what they did in the video game space.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.160]   Look what they did to Netscape with IE.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.840]   You know, look what they did to Lotus 123.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.120]   Look what they did to, you know, Lotus Notes.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.400]   I mean, they have a history of, you know, being slow
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.840]   and then coming in and kicking ass.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.680]   So.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.880]   - I think this is, I think this is what,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.000]   you still harkens back to the days that went
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.600]   and they lost the deal for the double click deal,
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.920]   where, you know, right afterwards,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.680]   they started really heating up the negotiations with Yahoo.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.640]   You know, they wanted that double click deal
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.280]   pretty badly, Microsoft.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.120]   - Oh yeah. - But I think that was,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.680]   you know, I think that was a real smack
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.280]   and they really said, you know what,
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.080]   we're going to make sure that, you know,
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.280]   'cause they don't like to be beaten.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.000]   These guys are ultra competitive
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.600]   and, you know, they just want to go and find
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.080]   how can they get back as best as possible.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.880]   And this was the only real play here.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.520]   - Do you find, I mean, is this, is this,
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.280]   Steve Balmer's farewell?
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.840]   I mean, look, if this does a flop,
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.800]   he couldn't get double click.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.280]   Now I can't get my Yahoo.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.800]   Is Balmer starting to look like the fall guy here?
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.000]   - That's what TechCrunch says.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.880]   - I mean, it looks like two guys fighting over a toy
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.560]   is what it looks like to me, you know?
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.880]   And it kind of, you know, what happens to the toy
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.720]   in the end, right?
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.640]   - Yeah, it gets torn apart.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.480]   That's right.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.760]   - Tore to point, crumple the floor.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.600]   - Yeah.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.680]   Well, that's how I feel it.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.000]   - I think Balmer, I think Balmer,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.880]   I think Balmer at this point has a pretty hard time
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.720]   convincing anybody that he has a strategy.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.880]   - He doesn't look so good, does he?
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.720]   After all that?
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.560]   - He's just, I agree that he's not.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.760]   I don't think he comes off very soon.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.040]   I think he comes off, Microsoft right now
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.000]   looks extremely disorganized.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.040]   - Don't you think Bill Gates is sitting in the big office
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.880]   up in the big--
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.720]   - I'm not close to Spiel.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.560]   - Big Bill Gates is sitting in his office
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.640]   in the big tower just going,
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.080]   (growling)
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.760]   - I just, you know what, I gotta disagree.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.640]   I'm sorry, but I think, you know, it was a visionary,
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.000]   like, majorly gutsy move to even try this.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.640]   It's extremely hard to pull off.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.760]   Everybody knew that.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.920]   You thought it would happen that very next week though, Jason.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.760]   I gotta tell you.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.880]   - I seem like, well, I mean, listen,
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   it was within a couple of dollars of happening.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.200]   So what you have here is egos,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   and we've had this discussion on the show before.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.440]   These companies are run by, you know,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.240]   people who have major personal,
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.200]   it goes beyond, you know, like money.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.400]   For Jerry Yang, this is legacy.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.240]   He does not want to take that.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.080]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.720]   - He that he sold to Microsoft.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.040]   He desperate to not have that, because legacy--
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.440]   - He would do anything not to be bought by Microsoft, basically.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.960]   - Mark Andreessen's legacy is,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.280]   he got his ass kicked by--
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.600]   - Right.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.920]   - Yeah, he'll always be remembered that.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.240]   - And he'll always be referred to in the first paragraph
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.080]   of his Wikipedia page.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.000]   Here's the guy who got his ass kicked by Microsoft.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Jerry Yang did not want that to happen.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.400]   He pushed it as far as he could.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.920]   He did the scorched earth thing.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.560]   This is basically one man.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.320]   Jerry Yang decided to kill the deal,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.120]   because he does not want Yahoo to go to Microsoft.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.680]   - Andrew wasn't part of the problem
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.640]   that Yahoo couldn't really adopt an effective poison pill.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.840]   The way they'd structured the board,
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.720]   the way they staggered elections to the board.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.000]   - That's why they did all these business deals,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.440]   like giving the AdSense,
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.200]   doing the AdSense experiment with Google,
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   opening up search and giving away--
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   - Which was really kind of weird.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.320]   I mean, talk about a last minute ditch effort
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.840]   to just kind of put a monkey wrench.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.120]   It was a two day deal too.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.600]   I mean, what's ridiculous?
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.920]   - What's the most--
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.400]   - You're looking, what happened there?
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.160]   - And I still maintain that Balmer,
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.640]   I think, could have gotten it done.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.840]   Yeah, there would have been acrimony,
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.720]   there would have been hostility,
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.640]   but if he's as competitive and badass as he acts like he is,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.200]   then I don't think that anything Jerry Yang did
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   was enough to totally torpedo the deal.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.560]   I still think Balmer comes off looking like
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.040]   the guy who couldn't get it done.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.880]   Because even the two day AdSense test
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.400]   had the DOJ on their back, like in a second.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.160]   - These Yahoo shareholders are gonna be so angry.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.320]   I mean, it is not funny.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.280]   You're talking about a deal that was gold
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.320]   and it was a beautiful thing.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.840]   It was a, and questionably,
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.040]   Yang is coming in with a valuation of 37.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.840]   And where did he come up with that number?
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.040]   Can you imagine, back to your discussion of your car,
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.160]   you're the only one, Leo, that says that your car is worth
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.200]   - 37 bucks.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.520]   - Everybody else is saying it's worth less, 500.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.400]   And the fact of the matter is,
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.280]   Yang is throwing out this number
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.480]   and it's unbelievable that Microsoft even came up
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.560]   to the point that they were,
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.520]   compared to where it started about at $19.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.640]   I mean, the street is a very efficient.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.440]   - Well, that's the question
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.920]   'cause Yahoo says it's not efficient.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.520]   The Yahoo says that they've undervalued us.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.640]   We're worth so much more.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.480]   Is that just the founders faith in themselves?
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.040]   Maybe there is something more under the hood
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.920]   that we just don't see.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.160]   Maybe that Torino is supercharged.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.560]   - I, it could be supercharged, but you know what?
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.080]   You know, show me $25 on your own.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.320]   Show me $24.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.560]   Don't you mean 19?
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.800]   - I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.600]   It is no way, if you look at the numbers,
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.480]   if you look at the revenue numbers
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.080]   and you look at the slippage of Yahoo over the years
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.960]   and the fact that not only that,
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.800]   the other point of all this is the competitive nature
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.560]   of the web and who is obviously taking over the web.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.760]   Yahoo, I mean, what even happened to the overture?
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.920]   I mean, you remember when,
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.240]   you guys remember when overture was like
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   this great ad network?
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.080]   - Yeah.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.880]   - And it just, you know, who even thinks about it anymore?
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.240]   - Well, I mean, that, I think that's a good point.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.200]   I think Jerry Yang might be looking back
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.240]   and he has all these memories in the car
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.840]   that are really nice.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.760]   - It used to be shiny and--
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.880]   - I've got the first girlfriend of the car.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.960]   - There was that one time in the back seat.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.920]   - That's the next thing you get to the new order of the car.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.200]   They're like, that's not my memory.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.040]   - Yeah, right.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.880]   - It's kind of the classic story, isn't it?
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.000]   A homeowner does the same thing.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.560]   No, I put a lot of money in his house.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.240]   Why are you, you know, and you can't--
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.360]   - I place that jacuzzi.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.360]   - Yeah.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.640]   - Right, right, right.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.480]   - Right.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.320]   - No, he's definitely replacing--
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.400]   - It's a couple of interesting things.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.640]   I think there's a couple of interesting things,
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.920]   which is one, Leah, I think you and Paul
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.400]   were saying on Windows Weekly,
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.960]   there's kind of no obvious successor to Gates.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.720]   When you think of like, who's the next person in line
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.320]   to run Microsoft after Bulma,
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.440]   there's no sort of, there's nobody that you would
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.320]   automatically say, well, they're gonna step up
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.160]   and be the next Bulma or the next Gates.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.080]   - Or a Buffet.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.000]   - Or a Buffet.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.360]   - Yeah, let's hear 80 year old Theo.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.520]   - So do you think that this would have happened
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.480]   with Bill Gates at the helm?
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.960]   Would he have made this offer for Yahoo?
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.480]   - Yeah, never.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.920]   Because Gates is another massive,
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.640]   he's a founder with a personality like Yang.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.120]   And if Bulma and Yang couldn't get on together,
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.160]   I can't imagine for one second that Gates and Yang
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.600]   would get on together, the Clash of Eagles would just be like,
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.160]   it'd be like matter and anti-matter or something.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.560]   - Yeah, I think it's pretty much perfectly nailed it
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.440]   with regard to Gates and his buyout strategy
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.840]   for Yahoo if you've seen that episode.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.680]   - Where was that?
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.760]   - The Buyout Boys episode, where Homer starts,
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.080]   oh, I can't even, this is embarrassing
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.320]   in the midst of all this big mergers and acquisitions talk.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.120]   But you know that one where Homer starts an internet company
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.280]   and then Bill Gates comes in and says,
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.440]   buy him out boys and they trash the whole place.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.280]   (laughing)
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.440]   And beat the crap out of the house.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.200]   That totally would have been Bill Gates' approach.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.640]   - I think there was an also another interesting
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.960]   sort of facet to the deal which I read earlier
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.400]   from my particular interesting kind of standpoint,
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.480]   which is that a lot of people were spinning it
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.680]   as the first real victory for Google's massive
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.960]   Washington DC lobbying effort.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.920]   In the last couple of years,
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.680]   Google's really ratcheted up the number
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.360]   of sort of lobbyists that it employs in Washington
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.760]   to put its case to politicians and the DOJ
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.040]   and people like that.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.440]   And it does seem like one of the major obstacles
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.120]   to Yahoo and Microsoft getting the deal done
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.800]   was that Yahoo wanted so much money
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.720]   'cause they were so scared of this antitrust issue coming up
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.920]   and of the problems that they were gonna have
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   with the DOJ integrating, which was basically all started
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.280]   by Google sort of lobbying effort in DC trying to say,
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.720]   well, there's gonna be loads of antitrust implications
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.080]   and it's gonna be a real nightmare.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.800]   And Yahoo bought it hook line and sinker.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.400]   - Yeah, that was just that.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.320]   - That was just Google going around throwing out
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.560]   these sort of insinuations and just,
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.800]   in any conversation Eric Schmidt happened to be having,
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   by the way, I'm really concerned about this Microsoft Yahoo
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.840]   thing, that's gonna be terrible for everyone.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.360]   It was a little ridiculous.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.200]   I mean, after buying up to be like, oh,
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.120]   and also, I mean, in the web-based business.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.600]   - But it worked.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.440]   I don't think it worked.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.200]   I think you can-- - I'm not sure that's what happened.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.120]   - The reason the deal didn't happen was because of price.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.440]   So I don't think that the DOJ stuff,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.400]   you know, would have been a big deal.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.000]   And the only thing people were saying,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.240]   I saw Kara Swisher was talking about over and over again,
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.560]   the email, oh my God, they're gonna have 80%
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.760]   market share an email.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.120]   But in order to have a monopoly problem like this,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.760]   it's you have to be doing something bad with the monopoly.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.840]   If you have one, that's not a crime.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.600]   It's just how you use it and that kind of stuff.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.840]   And it's consumer choice limited.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.480]   There's a whole battery of tests they use.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.280]   - It's okay to have a monopoly.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.120]   - It's not the only-- - You know,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.440]   there's a million different places
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.760]   you can go to get free email.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.600]   I mean, does anybody who wants a Yahoo or a Hotmail account
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.240]   at this point, many people have accounts
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.640]   or people who don't want to give up their address.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.640]   - Don't know about Google.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.000]   - Or another one, they don't know about Gmail.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.600]   So that's ridiculous.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.520]   I mean, I don't think that's a major antitrust issue.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.640]   Like, oh my God, people are suffering for choice
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.120]   for free email.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.880]   - You have another problem with this whole thing.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.440]   Back to the car discussion where you want to
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.520]   how things look and what you perceive things.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.480]   You know, the perception now is, you know,
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.320]   you have a girlfriend, a boyfriend,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.960]   and some really, one of the cool kids is going out with them
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.680]   and everybody wants to go out with that person.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.200]   Well, all of a sudden, there was,
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.440]   if you saw what happened when Microsoft stepped in,
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.640]   everybody picked up their heads and said,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.960]   "Whoa, look at that, interesting, buying Yahoo.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.120]   Maybe we'll come into offer."
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.000]   You know, and you had all these kind of side deals
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.760]   starting to be talked about and happening.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.200]   Now, all of a sudden, we're getting a lot of news
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.000]   that news corp has, you know, cooled and, you know,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.840]   you were thinking that, well,
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.120]   who's really going to step up to the plate?
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.200]   Now, I mean, who's going to want to deal with Yang?
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.000]   - Well, it seemed like those deals were never,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.040]   it almost seemed like those deals were all initiated
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.960]   by Yang, though, that it was Yang shopping for other offers
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.920]   to try to make himself look more attractive.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.800]   I felt like almost all of those rumors
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.240]   seemed very one-sided.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.160]   - Like, in a way, though.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.480]   - Like, we've been courting AOL and AOL's kind of,
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.920]   you know, Time Warner's kind of interested.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.000]   No, News Corp, you know they have their anas too.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.520]   And it might just be because Yang called them up.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.360]   - You know what it is?
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.800]   All these companies have deal teams
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.040]   who are constantly modeling these things.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.280]   You're having been at one of them.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.360]   You know, like, if we had this asset
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.600]   that we have these two assets together,
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.280]   then you'd get rid of all this overhead, you know,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.200]   between having two, and then it'd be this much more profit.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.680]   - Spreadsheet monkeys.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.440]   - The spreadsheet monkey is, you know,
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.000]   and there's private equity monkeys
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.520]   who would do this kind of monkey business all day long.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.280]   So it's not really--
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.880]   - I just got a Twitter for John C. Devourer,
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.680]   at 30,000 feet over the Pacific as he flies to Korea.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.840]   He says, "I just want to tell you one thing.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.600]   I predicted this."
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.440]   - Yeah.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.280]   - Yeah.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.960]   - She, Calicanish, not so far now.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.800]   - Ha ha!
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.640]   - I told you.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.480]   - I told you so.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.480]   - He said it wouldn't happen.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.560]   - You're never gonna arrive.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.400]   - He said it would happen.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.240]   - Little spacey.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.880]   He had a 50% chance of being right.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.560]   - Well, we all had a 50% chance of being right
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.400]   and we got it wrong.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.080]   Although, as you pointed out, all of you,
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:36.960]   it ain't over yet.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.000]   The fat lady has not sung.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.480]   However, we're gonna wrap this up with one word,
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.600]   just one word from Steve Baum.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.400]   - Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.760]   Developers, developers, developers, developers,
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.720]   developers, developers, developers.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.960]   - All right, that's enough of that.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.040]   - Wow.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.440]   - Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your ears on that one.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.480]   - I guess technically that is just one word.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.320]   - That's one word.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   Said many, many times.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.320]   (laughs)
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.160]   Did you see this?
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.000]   I thought this was interesting.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.360]   Web page sizes have tripled since 2003,
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.360]   from 2003 to 2008.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   The average web page grew from 93.7K to over 312K.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.680]   The top 100--
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.240]   - 300K for an average web page.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.480]   - That's the top 100 pages in 2007.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.320]   300K is the average.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.080]   - Yeah, they're dealing with a lot of home pages there
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:27.920]   in that study.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.800]   - No, no, these are the top 1000, I should say.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.040]   Top 1000 web pages.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.920]   So they're not even just like bogus pages, not guys.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.840]   - I know, but like Yahoo.com and AOL--
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.000]   - They're giant, aren't they?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.600]   - They're like, those things are giant.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.800]   Ridiculous.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   If you want to see a really ridiculous page,
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.920]   go to qq.com, that's a big portal in China.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.320]   And then you'll see Ridiculous.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.080]   - The letter Q, the letter Q, two Qs?
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.640]   - Yeah, QQ.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.760]   I mean, you think web design here is crazy.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.160]   - That's 'cause everybody in China has broadband, right?
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.120]   Actually, they're all in internet cafes.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.440]   - Yeah, and they just--
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.480]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.760]   - They like to have a-- - Wow.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.200]   - Holy cow, they're just--
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.280]   - That's a lot of stuff.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.280]   - It's still loading.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.120]   (laughs)
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.200]   - Speaking of the web pages, you know,
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.040]   talk about design, what's the story with the AOL webpage
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.760]   being almost an identical footprint to the Yahoo webpage?
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.600]   - Well, that was the other-- - I mean, how about--
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.080]   - Yeah, okay, however you want to look at it,
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.600]   but I mean, isn't it kind of, you know,
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.120]   how do they get away with that?
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.320]   Why would they do something like that?
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.640]   - What's happened is they've optimized and optimized
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.440]   and you-- - Are they that--
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.920]   - You see people-- - Far, far--
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.960]   - Different units from each other,
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.320]   and then a web lingo gets started.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.600]   So for example, for a long time, LSD was the design standard
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.760]   for these sites, logo, search box, and then directory.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.440]   And then it became LSN, which is logo, search box, news,
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.600]   and because that would get more people to come.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   And it's like anything when you do a web design,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.040]   there's a metaphor that's been established,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   like Amazon established tabs and the shopping cart.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.640]   If you come in and you try to re-educate users,
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.800]   it's basically costing yourself money,
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.320]   so they just basically--
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.640]   - So everybody looks the same?
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.480]   - It really is.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.480]   I put a-- - The geosight looks the same, right?
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   Everybody-- - I did a little video where I put,
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.800]   I overlaid the two and kind of just did a quick fade
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.200]   in and out on my website, and it's identical.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.920]   I mean, it really is. - That's interesting.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.280]   - Do the same thing with every video site.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.120]   I mean, you look at YouTube-- - They do the all-to-the-all--
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.760]   - Here's the video-- - Yeah.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.600]   - And underneath it are the comments--
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.560]   - On the right is the other videos, yeah, you're right.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.680]   - The bed and the permalink URL.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.560]   And if you establish something like that in people's minds,
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.880]   the next 20 people who come,
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.000]   they're not gonna re-establish the paradigm,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.800]   nor should they, because it costs psychic energy
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.360]   on the part of the user. - Right.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.120]   So there's a reason they all look the same,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.920]   it's just become the standard kind of the default,
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.400]   the way we expect it to be.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.320]   And people used to-- - Yeah, and it was that way
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.520]   with sort of the original web page designs,
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.360]   everyone did the L, basically, with the F10 nap,
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.600]   the content-- - I still do the L
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.400]   because I haven't gotten the LSD yet,
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.680]   but I'm looking forward to that.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.360]   - A lot of fun. (laughs)
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   Albert Hoffman passed away, by the way, age of 102,
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   the creator of LSD took the first trip in 1943.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.440]   65 years later, it takes before, wow.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.760]   Do you think he had flashbacks at 101?
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.600]   (laughs)
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.120]   - He didn't know he was 101, he still 40 was 36.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.960]   - I'm trippin', man, whoa!
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.120]   - What does it tell you about frequent LSD
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.080]   used that he lived that long? - Yeah.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.560]   Well, I don't know, maybe he didn't use it frequently.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.320]   Maybe he just invented it. - Yeah, keep jobs LSD user.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.160]   - But I'm sure, yeah, he dropped a lot of acid
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.120]   at Reed University and dropped out.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.840]   - There was a lot of talk for a while,
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.040]   there were books and things,
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   there were a lot of Apple design teams
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.840]   who were on various narcotics,
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.720]   a very point of design schedules.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.520]   I'm sure I read that. - Not acid, probably speed.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.480]   - You say Walt Disney was, I created the submarine
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.120]   in the park, the underwater adventure.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.760]   I'm sitting on LSD on a rock in Sedona.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   (laughs)
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.960]   - That can't be true, Andrew.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.040]   - I was there, I was there, I was there,
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.240]   and on a tour and they sat down, they said,
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.720]   look at it, and I said, I don't see it, they said,
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.560]   well, he was on LSD and I--
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.640]   - Wait a minute, Disney said this to you?
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.200]   - Not Disney, no, not Disney, the tour guide
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.280]   that was telling me-- - He went on the hippie tour
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.360]   of Disneyland. - Yeah, that's just in Sedona
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.440]   in Arizona. - Oh, in Arizona, yeah.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.680]   - Zembles the submarine in the underwater adventure.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.040]   - And it did? - Oh, got there.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:25.960]   - It really did, huh?
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.440]   Huh, that was a crappy ride, though.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.440]   - Yeah, well, it's no longer there.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.200]   Yeah, they have got some signing.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.840]   - Did he invent the inflatable seats
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.880]   at the moon launch ride too when he was tripping?
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.280]   'Cause that was pretty weird.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   (laughs)
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.080]   Seats in flight, I missed that.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.360]   That was with the good old days.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.040]   In the '50s, people were easily amused.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   The seats inflated, they went,
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.160]   ooh, that was a good ride.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.000]   (laughs)
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.720]   Man, that was good.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.160]   Mark Hamburg leaves Adobe to go to Microsoft.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.720]   Here's, you know, you said that it wasn't
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.880]   about the engineers, Andrew.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.560]   Maybe, you think Microsoft can get anybody they want,
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.600]   so they don't care about the Yahoo engineers?
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.720]   It isn't about the engineering, it's about something else.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   - I mean, if these days, if we get back to the fact
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.600]   the web pages are almost essentially the same,
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.240]   and there's not that much of a difference,
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.200]   and what else they have?
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.760]   I mean, Microsoft has their silver light,
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.400]   and that's their big thing coming to be competitive.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.240]   - Right, right.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.760]   - And just, you know, talk about, you know,
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.800]   if what if Microsoft just takes over that market,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.920]   I don't see that happening.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.160]   I just can't imagine that happening.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.920]   It's too prevalent, the flash.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.720]   - But the, Mark Hamburg's a guy who,
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.400]   you know, he's the number, he's a guy
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.920]   created Lightroom for Adobe, created Adobe Camera Raw.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.640]   He's really a Photoshop big shot,
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.400]   been working on Photoshop since version two.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.120]   I mean, after the Knoll brothers, he's the guy,
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.840]   and here he is leaving Adobe for Microsoft.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.640]   They probably offered him 37 bucks.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.320]   - Probably, but still, I mean, the competitive nature,
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.800]   I mean, Microsoft is, I think, just trying to stake
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   a lot of territory here.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.560]   I think they see an opportunity, you know,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.240]   they see kind of this, you know, bifurcation
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.800]   of the Biggies these days.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.000]   And from a, from a, from a dollar standpoint,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.040]   there's not much more to invest in.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.360]   And not to mention the fact that, you know,
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   get back to the financials, you have interest rates so low.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   So, you know, money usage right now,
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.400]   they have to really find a place to create shareholder value.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.280]   And there's just not much more out there.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.960]   You know, Microsoft has been in a,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.560]   just a flat line, essentially, for a long time.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.560]   And they really have to do something
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.840]   to create some kind of value here.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.040]   - You agree, Jason?
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.120]   I mean, this is your, this is your ballpark.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.360]   - They definitely were trying to hire a lot of engineers.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.280]   And although it seems from the outside
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.760]   that things are less complex because of the design,
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.960]   it's actually the opposite, it's more complex.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.880]   - Right, under the hood, it's much more complex.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.560]   - Scaling, I mean, you know, we look at what Google's doing
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.160]   in terms of the number of data centers
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.240]   and amount of, you know, services they're putting up.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.200]   You look at what Amazon's doing with EC2 and S3
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.760]   and Google's doing with shared services.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.920]   I mean, there's a lot of technical work to be done.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.000]   And there was a major land grab for the engineers as well.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.560]   And I talked to somebody inside of Microsoft
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.080]   who was their most exciting part about the Yahoo deal
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.840]   was having a major footprint in the Valley
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.800]   to partner with other startup companies,
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.440]   buy startup companies and have thousands of engineers
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.600]   and be recruiting, you know, engineers from there.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.240]   So it was definitely a big part of...
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.040]   - That's interesting.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.440]   Having a footprint in the Valley could have been part of it.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.640]   Just having, they were buying an address.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.880]   - They were buying a culture change, you know?
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.720]   - Right.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.760]   - And they're buying in that, you know,
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.960]   it's very hard for Microsoft to move the needle.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.600]   They need very big businesses.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.080]   So they have to go after extremely big markets.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:35.640]   And, you know, software is a huge market.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.440]   Operating systems is a huge market.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.840]   Video games is a huge market.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.160]   What's left?
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.000]   Advertising online is a big market.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.440]   And online services are a big market
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.040]   and they don't really have that.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.920]   And so what you're gonna see them do is
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.240]   they're gonna go on a buying spree.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.720]   They're gonna just buy everything they can get their hands on.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.560]   That's good.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.040]   They're gonna buy 50 companies a year in the internet space.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.400]   This is gonna be incredible for entrepreneurs.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.160]   - Now they go out and take out the loans
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.600]   to buy Yahoo or they just kind of...
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.440]   - No, they can...
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.600]   - Kind of cash.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.120]   - Well, there were some loans involved weren't there?
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.360]   They were gonna be loans if they had to push the price.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.760]   That was the big issue.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.920]   They didn't wanna really get to that point.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.480]   - So they didn't take any loans.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.640]   So what I was wondering is are they sitting now suddenly
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.800]   on a kitty that they can spend on other stuff?
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.200]   - They always have $30 billion, $40 billion cash.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.040]   - Just flying around.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.840]   - Something extra for pocket change.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.680]   - Araining it.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.440]   - You need to move fast on something.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   - The other thing is this whole cloud computing issue,
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   this whole getting to the next level of virtualization
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.280]   has been huge.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.200]   That's something I've been following quite closely.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.640]   And you had the whole problem with VMware
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.880]   where Microsoft pretty much went dead at them
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.600]   because they knew this is gonna be the next space
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.920]   they wanted to conquer.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.960]   And when they do, as you mentioned, Jason,
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.200]   these various server farms with the virtualization systems
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.360]   and when they came out recently with the death blow
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.760]   for VMware, essentially, where they offered the virtualization
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.000]   suite inside of the long-horned server.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.640]   They put out what last month.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.480]   And we saw VMware drop out 50% on that.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.360]   But the fact is that I think this is the next territory
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.600]   they really wanna get into.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.880]   - All right, I wanna ask Jason about the Mahalo Idol search
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.480]   in just a second before we do that though.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.960]   Has that for a tease?
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.520]   Jason will announce the winner in a moment,
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.600]   but before we do that, or maybe not, I don't know.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.000]   I wanna mention audible.com.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   The great folks at Audible--
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.360]   - Audible.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.620]   (laughing)
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.320]   - Jason, you think this--
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.160]   - A portable!
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.080]   - I love audible.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.800]   - You think Jason that I will be more likely
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.920]   to invite you on Twitter if you do this
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.600]   or is this really how you feel?
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.200]   - I have always loved audible.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.520]   Everybody knows that.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.000]   I'm a big fan of Audible for a decade, in fact.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.360]   And I love audiobooks.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.600]   I live in Los Angeles.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.120]   - You said, I think you were doing a stream
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.760]   and you said, and I didn't get there in time,
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.320]   that you would do an audible ad on the stream
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.120]   if I just logged in.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.040]   - Yeah, anytime.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.400]   You just give me a phone number to call.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.760]   I'll leave an audible ad on your voice.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.000]   (laughing)
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.920]   - He will call each and every one of you personally
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.600]   and do your very own custom.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.960]   - You can get, I mean, right now if you down
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.160]   wanna listen to a best seller,
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.800]   you get your first three months, only 749 a month.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.000]   I mean, it's nothing, $15 a month.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.440]   The amount of education you'll get out
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.880]   of your Audible subscription is worth
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.000]   a lot more than 180 beans a year.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.080]   - That's true, there are two offers.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.160]   And you know, somebody sent me a note saying,
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.240]   you know, you've got the Twitter offer,
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.200]   where you got audible.com/twit and you sign up
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.320]   and you get a coupon Twitter, credit Twitter, free book.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.600]   But there is another offer and they said,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.840]   well, why don't you offer that other offer?
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.520]   And I wanted to say, yes, you can do the 749 offer,
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.720]   three audiobooks, 749 a month for three months.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.120]   That's a 50% off.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.640]   And it includes a book, credit a month.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.520]   So it depends what you like,
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.000]   what, you know, how you roll.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.360]   If you want a free book, go to audible.com/twit.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.560]   If you want the 50% discount on three books,
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.160]   go audible.com/twit749.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.600]   And we've recommended so many things.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.640]   Maybe you would want the three books, audible.com/twit749.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.800]   What are you reading these days, Jason?
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.200]   You got a book you wanna recommend or shall I recommend one?
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.000]   - Gosh, so many good books out there.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.800]   You know, one thing I was gonna mention
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.760]   to people though, before we get into actually
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.120]   what all the great books are available,
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.080]   is this some common misconceptions,
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.120]   like you can't burn a CD or something like that.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.040]   - Yeah, you can, you can burn 'em on a CD, yeah.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.680]   - And that's the thing I think some people forget is,
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.360]   you know, oh, he has to get a little DRM
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.160]   and whatever to make sure the authors get their money
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.320]   and also to make the authors feel comfortable doing it.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.400]   But you can just burn these things to CDs.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.960]   And so every time the first thing I do
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.520]   when I buy an Audible book is I burn the CD,
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.640]   I put a Sharpie on it, boom,
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.320]   and I have them all in a big folder.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   So I never lose them.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   And then if my wife or my brother wants to borrow
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.480]   the CD, I can hand it to them.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.760]   You start a little collection up.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.000]   I mean, it's really, you know, very helpful.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.160]   - Well, I am a big fan.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.080]   I wanna say I just finished a book that just knocked me out.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.640]   It was very funny called The Dog of the South by Charles Portis.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:02.120]   A little book, very humorous read by Edward Lewis in dialect.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.920]   And it's a story of a Ray Midge
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.280]   who tracks down his wife Norma,
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   who's run off to Belize in, by the way, his Ford Torino.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.160]   Coincidence?
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.520]   - I don't know.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.920]   - I don't know.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.600]   But along the way he meets kind of a crazed doctor
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.000]   who has a bus named The Dog of the South.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.160]   And they talk about a writer of inspirational books
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.240]   for Salesman, John Selmerdick's.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.280]   It's a very dry, kind of surreal wit
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.880]   that I just fell in love with.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.600]   I was very sad when I ended The Dog of the South by Charles
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.800]   Portis that could be your free book.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.720]   Now the nice thing is you can go to Audible
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.600]   and listen to any of these books.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.480]   You can get a sample so you can hear what it's gonna sound like
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.720]   so you can know if this is what you wanna listen to.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.520]   Audible.com/twit for the free book.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.720]   Audible.com/twit749 for the 50% off.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.320]   Either way, if you're not an Audible member
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.520]   you really ought to join today.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.360]   And then once you join keep listening
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.400]   'cause on all the shows now,
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.160]   'cause Audible's a sponsor of the entire network,
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.240]   we do recommend books.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.560]   And, you know, on the Steve's show on the security now
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.880]   we try to do sci-fi, I try to do comedy with the gizwiz.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.440]   We just have a broad range of stuff that we talk about.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.560]   - You know what you're gonna wanna do, Leo,
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.240]   is you don't wanna just, at this point in the show,
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.600]   just pause it over Audible.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.440]   - Yeah.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.280]   - Take five, 10 minutes on.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.120]   - Sure.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.960]   - It's time.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.800]   - And then you're gonna put it down.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.880]   - This is unbelievable.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.360]   Just like an NPR pledge driver.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   (laughing)
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.360]   - Got it, it is.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.920]   - The two of you going on like this.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.240]   - It is.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.480]   - I was gonna recommend a book,
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.200]   but now I'm feeling like it might be too much.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.840]   - Starry Drumroll, please.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.160]   (laughing)
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.800]   - Put it down with three books and get them on your hard drive
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.480]   and on your iPod so you don't,
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.080]   you know, when you're out there in the wild
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.840]   and you're bored and you have time,
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.720]   that's when you need it.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.560]   So you gotta go stop right now and go get it.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.360]   They even have the four hour work week with--
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.960]   - That's a good one, Tim Ferriss, yeah.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.800]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.720]   - Unless you get a tote bag and a windup radio.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.800]   - You know, you gave me an inspirational idea here, Molly.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.720]   Maybe I should do a Twitter thon.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.200]   You know, we could do that for, you know,
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.880]   the whole weekend, we could be like Labor Day, I could say,
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.240]   you know, let's do something for my kids.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.600]   But it'll actually be my kids, not, not, you know.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.440]   - Leo's kid. - Leo's kid.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.280]   - Leo's kid.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.360]   - You okay, what about my kids?
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.800]   (laughing)
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.640]   - You'd be like an honorable book.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.480]   - You'd be like a radio host.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.720]   - The radio host, not any of the radio hosts, like,
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.880]   you know, I'm not gonna say anything more.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.080]   It's like at $5,000.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.920]   - Right, that's exactly right.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.400]   - So it's $5,000 landing.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.800]   - For my kids. - Yeah, it's a good thing.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.640]   - For Leo's kids, we'll do a Twitter thon.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.480]   (laughing)
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.280]   - Look at this, what, $7 a day.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.680]   - Hey, they're going to college in a couple of years.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.200]   I might actually have to do that. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.680]   Hey, thanks Audible for your support.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.600]   - No.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.000]   - And thank you, Mr. Calicanis for your.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.840]   (laughing)
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.640]   - Well, I wanna say thank you to Audible.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.600]   (laughing)
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.200]   - Hey, Jason, Jason, my book is coming out.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.560]   They tell me in two weeks on Audible.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.400]   - Is it really?
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.680]   - The discipline investor, you're gonna have that Audible?
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.520]   - That's what they tell me.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.000]   I keep on waiting, but they keep telling me
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   it's next week, next week.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.640]   But this time they tell me, it's really coming out next week.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.720]   The discipline investor.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.520]   - It will be-- - That's way more awesome.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.320]   - To get to recommend your own book on Audible.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   - You bet.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.800]   It will be our recommendation next week.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.400]   - Oh, oh, that's great.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.680]   - I'm pretty excited.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.400]   - You're not Anthony Horace.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.800]   He wrote a book called Snake Head.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.640]   That wasn't you.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.080]   - He's the, he's the--
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:12.920]   - He's your brother.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:13.760]   - How are you?
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.200]   - Outside of the family. (laughing)
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.840]   Okay, there's another Horowitz on here,
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.880]   but it's not Andrew.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.000]   Andrew Horowitz, it'll be called
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:19.840]   the discipline investor.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.080]   Look for an Audible next week.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.360]   Hey, that's cool.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.520]   Who'd you get to read it?
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.360]   They asked me to read it because of my podcast
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.560]   and they say that--
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.880]   - You get a great point?
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.840]   - I gotta tell you, don't do it if you have a chance.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.760]   It's not doing a book, and especially your own.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.840]   It's a tough read.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.240]   - Was it grueling?
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.680]   - Well, you just have to keep on making sure
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   that every single word is right and you know,
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.800]   just everything that go over and over and over and,
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.880]   you know, it's just hours and hours of reading
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.960]   and then to compress it down to what, four hours of book?
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.000]   - Wow. - Wow.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.800]   So yeah, 'cause if you make one mistake,
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.520]   they have to start. - You have to start.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.080]   - You know, I'm reading, you may have mentioned
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.520]   these confessions of an economic hitman.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.360]   - Isn't that great?
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.520]   Yeah, that was Dvorak's pick a while ago.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.920]   Isn't that fascinating?
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.160]   - His next book is out too.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.160]   And he's an interesting fellow, this guy.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.000]   I have not-- - Do you believe it?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:05.840]   Do you buy it?
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.680]   I think it's fantasy.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.520]   I think it's fairy tale.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   I think it's--
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.680]   - I have him coming on my podcast as a guest, Perkins,
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.160]   in June, I'm starting to think, wait a minute,
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.320]   this is all this is true.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.160]   - Now.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.400]   - He's getting tangled with this guy.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.720]   - He's the Carlos Castaneda of economics.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.440]   His premise is, and it's completely credible, I guess,
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.720]   is that instead of military imperialism,
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:30.040]   the US government has a form of economic imperialism,
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.640]   they send guys like him, economic hitmen into countries,
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.320]   to convince them to, you know, quote, modernize.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.000]   We're gonna build dams, it'll be amazing.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.800]   And they fake the numbers and they say,
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.840]   look at the economic upturn, your GDP is gonna skyrocket.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.840]   And all you have to do is borrow the money
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:51.000]   from American banks, use American contractors to build it.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.200]   So the money comes from America,
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.760]   goes through the country very briefly,
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.440]   and goes right back to America.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.280]   And then meanwhile, a few people, of course,
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.800]   in these countries, and I think he uses,
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.640]   what do you say, Honduras is an example?
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.960]   - Panama. - Panama.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.400]   - Panama. - Yeah, and Indonesia.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.800]   - Yeah, a few people in that country make a lot of money.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.800]   And the rest of the country is completely impoverished
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.760]   by their crippling debt.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.800]   And the reason that the US government wants to do this
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.200]   is because now, effectively, they own the country
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.560]   because of the crippling debt.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.320]   The irony is, now this was a few years ago,
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.760]   isn't that exactly what the Chinese just did to us?
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.600]   - Well, that's what he's saying.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.640]   In his next book, he's saying that,
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.400]   they learned very well from what we did.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.080]   - Now they're doing it right back.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.240]   - Exactly.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.920]   Listen, they have $500 billion worth of our debt,
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.840]   and if they decide to strangle hold up.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.440]   - Well, they won't though, because that would cripple them.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.800]   I mean, they need, I mean, we hope.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.720]   We're now kind of intertwined.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.880]   - We're very intertwined.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.880]   And so I-- - Maybe gonna look at some
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:44.720]   of the things that go on.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.080]   I mean, remember where we're all concerned
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.560]   about the exports and who's buying what,
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.960]   and all of a sudden these stories came out
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.480]   about the tainting of the toys from China?
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.640]   Like one, what happened to that?
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.080]   They just cleaned up their act all of a sudden?
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.120]   - Yeah, because we owe them half a trillion dollars
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.440]   or whatever it is.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.760]   - Guys, I have to say, if we're gonna talk
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.320]   about economic hitmen, I have been both the last three days
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.680]   playing GTA 4, obsessive.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.040]   - Oh, that's the other big story of the week.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.760]   I was trying to decide, should we start with Microsoft Yahoo
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.160]   or Grand Theft Auto?
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   - See, and I was gonna have to cut out early
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.240]   because my husband was playing Mario Kart in the other room.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.320]   - Really?
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.680]   - Yeah, I still might have to go.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.380]   - Is your husband a wuss?
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.120]   - What?
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.240]   - Doesn't he wanna carry a bat and slay hookers instead?
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.240]   - Dude, have you played Mario Kart for Wii?
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.760]   - No, I wouldn't.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.080]   That's a game for kids.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.760]   Mario Kart for Wii, even saying it,
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.640]   I feel kind of embarrassed.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.080]   - Well, then you're missing out.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.240]   - Is it really that fun?
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.080]   What is it?
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.160]   - Oh my God, it's so fun.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.320]   (laughing)
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.240]   Come on, it's so fun.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.320]   - I'm trying to decide what game machine,
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.080]   we're getting a big screen TV,
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.400]   in the Twit Studios of course,
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.960]   'cause no studio is a studio unless it has a big screen TV.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.040]   I'm trying to decide what game machine,
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.120]   so you're saying I should get a Wii.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.000]   - Well, I actually would not only get a Wii,
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.240]   'cause I admit that we play probably the Xbox 360,
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.080]   a little bit of a Wii.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:03.920]   - So you say Wii plus 360.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.160]   - There's more game potential, I think you got it both.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.240]   - I was thinking PS3, will you say 360?
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.560]   - Well, PS3, you got the cool Blu-ray hotness,
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.920]   so I guess if you wanted to watch films
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.360]   on your big screen as well.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.880]   - I'm gonna get, I'm thinking I'm getting GTA, PS3,
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.160]   and then I'm gonna DIE.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.400]   - Yeah, pretty much.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.240]   - From lack of--
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.160]   - Not any TV, yeah, you got the target of Rock Band.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.000]   - Have you played Rock Band?
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.760]   - Well, that's the other thing, I wanna play Rock Band.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.200]   Now I can play Rock Band on either Xbox or PS3, right?
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.360]   - Yeah, that's all.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.040]   - I'm getting all the instruments too, so we can,
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.720]   and then when you guys come up for the Twitted Thon,
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.440]   to raise money for Leo's kids.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.280]   - So you're gonna do like,
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.520]   Breakaways like the Telethon where they have,
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.400]   okay, now performing on these problems
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.240]   is decent kind of like--
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.240]   - Yeah, exactly!
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.680]   - Don't you think they'll be awesome?
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.440]   - And, boom, of Audible to do.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.400]   - I'm gonna say I love this guy,
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.840]   he's a close personal friend of mine,
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.040]   we've been working together for many years.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.360]   I'm just really pleased to bring him out on this stage.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.200]   Please put your hands together on the drums,
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.640]   ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jason, Kala Canis, and now--
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.480]   - Thank you!
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   - Jason's got that original song, Audible, I love you.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.520]   (laughing)
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.720]   - Audible!
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.560]   - Audible!
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.520]   - Do you, are you guitar hero three, Jason, at Mahalo,
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.600]   or are you Rock Band at Mahalo?
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.160]   - Oh, we're Rock Banding it out.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.000]   - You have to be Rock Band because the vocals and everything,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.960]   the drums are a little, I can tell you the drums,
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.920]   but vocals and a bass guitar, it just makes--
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.840]   - It's fun, it's a whole band,
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.800]   and then everybody gets to play.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.640]   - It's so much fun.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.480]   - Yeah.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.320]   - You know, Brandon.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.720]   - My daughter comes all dressed in garb,
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.200]   you know, with the pants and the big--
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.560]   - You're kidding!
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.400]   - Show 'em a son, she shows up like,
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.240]   "What do you want?"
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.080]   "Oh, I'm singing tonight."
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:36.920]   I'm like, "Okay."
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.320]   - Pat Benatar, here I am.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.720]   (laughing)
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.440]   Okay, okay, so Grand Theft Auto,
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.600]   who's, show of hands, who's played it,
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.920]   will obviously.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.080]   Jason, have you played it yet?
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:47.920]   - Delphate.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.800]   - Yeah, we have it in the office,
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   and somebody had an early copy.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   - Vaughn got an early copy.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.280]   - Well, early copy's floating around,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.880]   and they were playing it here for five or six days straight,
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.240]   24 hours a day, and they just walked through on Mahalo.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.080]   - Oh my.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.120]   - You missed, you know, that strategy book?
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.640]   - Yeah, you don't need it.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.120]   - They're like, "Can we write the strategy book?"
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:11.960]   'Cause we wanna play it.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.720]   And I was like, "Sure, I will pay you."
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.720]   - That's big bucks, by the way,
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.080]   those strategy books, rake it in.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:20.200]   - We've had like literally 300,000 people come to this site
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.720]   for the walkthrough already, so it's gonna get millions
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.560]   of people to walk through.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.880]   - So no one knows how much Rockstar Games
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.880]   put into the development, but estimates about--
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.720]   - Over a hundred million.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.280]   - Over a hundred million.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.520]   And supposedly, Microsoft gave them 50 million
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.560]   just for the special content on the Xbox 360 alone, right?
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.800]   So they made that back, you know,
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.360]   half of that back right away.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.560]   - And now guitar hero people are talking about
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.400]   adding vocals because it's getting killed.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.320]   - Yeah, you got it.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.680]   - So the estimates were, and I haven't seen the numbers yet,
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.640]   maybe as much as $400 million in the first week on GTA 4.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.720]   - I believe--
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.160]   - That's a new record for both single day sales
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.520]   and the first week, I think.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.680]   - Yeah, what's the, sorry about the graphics?
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.880]   Those graphics are unbelievable.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.760]   I mean, just the close ups and how the cars kind of
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.080]   give it the answer that this is just--
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.400]   - It's just insane.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.200]   - I don't believe apart from anything else,
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.200]   it's like the scale of the thing.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.520]   It's like a next gen game and it's like a next gen level.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.760]   And then it's like an entire city worth of that.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.040]   And you can just go anywhere when you go through,
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.880]   my favorite things do is you just take a taxi ride
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.000]   down the Times Square section,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.880]   and you just sit and you look out the window
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.440]   as you're going past Times Square.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.600]   It just looks like nothing you've ever seen
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.440]   in the video game.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.120]   It's just mind-blowing.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.960]   - All right, I'm getting it.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.560]   I'm getting a big screen, I'm getting a PS3
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.480]   and I'm playing Grand Theft Auto and Rock Band.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.320]   And anybody who wants--
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.720]   - Are there any other graphics that even compete with this?
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.840]   I mean, this is, I mean, what I saw myself was playing
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.480]   and I said, it was amazing.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.400]   Anything else that's even near it?
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.240]   - I don't think so.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.480]   - Not on that scale.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.440]   I mean, if you get really close up,
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.240]   I mean, it's not quite rendering at 720p
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.920]   and some of the character models could, you know,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.880]   aren't quite on par with maybe something like Mass Effect,
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.160]   but the scale of GTA and the size
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.640]   and the flexibility is just completely beyond anything
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.160]   I think I've ever seen on a game.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.600]   - Now, somebody said that the moral,
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.280]   the moral quandaries are actually kind of amplified here,
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.360]   that when you kill somebody there,
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.120]   you could see them in pain,
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.480]   that oftentimes you get a hit assignment,
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.760]   but you know it's not the best thing for the family to do it.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.320]   There's always, you know, a price to pay for carnage.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.600]   So there's some actual, you know,
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.960]   I'm not saying it's not a violent game
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.720]   and it doesn't have some really CD elements,
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.280]   but it sounds like it's richer in terms of its ethical
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.280]   and emotional.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.560]   - Yeah, I think it's really interesting
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:43.400]   because there are lots of times when you can choose
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.400]   either to carry out a hit, you know,
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.600]   or not depending on whether, you know,
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.320]   what your sort of good conscience.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.800]   But I think what Rockstar has really done well
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:54.080]   is to bring you the sort of dramatic sense
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.320]   of the seriousness of what you're doing.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.280]   I don't want to spoil it too much for anybody,
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.880]   but when there's a sort of certain occasions
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.760]   when you do something that's particularly
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.400]   sort of unruly or pretty, you know, sort of bad for your soul.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.280]   And the music will just kick in like a major kind of background
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:14.960]   chorus where, and you just get the sudden feeling
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.240]   like you've just done this thing
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.920]   and now the music's kicked in and you're like,
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.000]   oh man, it's like that scene in a film
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.520]   where suddenly you're driving through the rain
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.280]   and it's hammering against the windscreen
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.440]   and this is really bad music
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.160]   and you just got a really bad feeling.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:31.600]   And GTA just nails that and it's unbelievable.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.400]   Hmm, we had a streaming over Ustream at the office
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.520]   for like those days when they were doing the book
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.840]   and they had 600, 700 people watching it live.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.560]   So, you're about to-- - Wow, just watching other people play.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.280]   That's how you did this. - Yeah, 600, 700 people
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   were watching other people play
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.760]   and so many people were in the room for hours
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.560]   watching them play.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.200]   That is how cinematic and amazing it.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.960]   I thought it was a cut scene when I went up to the computer
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.640]   and the plasma TV and I was like, is that a cut scene?
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.800]   They were like, no, that's the game.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.040]   Can't wait.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.880]   It's like that movie, remember "Beowulf"?
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.720]   How you couldn't really tell if it was a character
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.600]   or if it was an animation or that same level
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.600]   of amazing animation.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.880]   That's kind of what we've been waiting for.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.920]   I mean, as this technology, it gets faster, faster
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   and look at this is what the PS3 was designed to do
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.400]   with a cell chip and the very high end graphics
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   is to make realistic life like graphics in real time.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.920]   Is it better on the Xbox or the PS3?
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.200]   - I was wondering, does anyone know?
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.560]   - Let's forget the downloadable content
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.480]   'cause the Xbox has additional content
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.760]   but if you forget that, which does the best graphics.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.320]   - Well, you've got an agonizing 10 minute install
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.960]   on the PS3 as soon as you put the game in your drive
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.840]   so you've just got that 10 minutes of death
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.680]   where you're sort of--
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.000]   - That's only one.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:46.840]   That's only one.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.960]   - But apart from that, there's almost no discernible
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.800]   difference whatsoever.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.640]   - Interesting.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.960]   - Apart from the fact that you don't get rumble,
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.760]   obviously on the PS3, unless you've got the new dual shot.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:56.600]   - Right.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.560]   - But it's, everything that I've read
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.640]   and all the screenshots and I've seen everything
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.160]   pretty much no difference.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:04.880]   You can take your pick.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.920]   - Plus Leo, you know, Netflix is gonna charge you
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.520]   a premium to rent those Blu-ray discs
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.360]   plus they cost more.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.880]   - They're gonna charge me extra?
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.720]   - That's the way to go.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.560]   - Yes.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.880]   - Do you hear the Netflix?
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.800]   Oh yeah, they said that they're gonna charge more
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.640]   to rent Blu-ray discs.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.480]   - What?
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   - Because they're gonna cost them a buy.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.480]   - It hasn't been more up to now.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.320]   - I know.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.400]   (laughs)
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.720]   - Because that's the thing,
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.280]   all the Blu-ray Association players
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.320]   are jacking up the prices on everything Blu-ray,
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.200]   which is why they're not selling a damn thing.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.240]   And now they're, and that includes the DVD
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.920]   and Netflix just, it was, I think he said it in an interview.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.160]   So it wasn't a formal announcement,
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.400]   but he said in response to a question in an interview
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.440]   that there would be a small premium on Blu-ray.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.600]   - These idiots, these idiots at Blu-ray
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.320]   are gonna kill themselves or put themselves
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.240]   out of business, this is so stupid.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.080]   You know, Blu-ray--
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.160]   - So I'm just gonna get the Xbox and download Galore.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.880]   - Yeah, maybe, maybe.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.000]   You know, the--
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.280]   - I have Xbox Live as well.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.120]   - I have both.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.240]   Xbox, Xbox Live, although, you know,
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.920]   when I had the Red Ring, by the way,
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.440]   one thing you don't get with the PS3
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.120]   is the Red Ring of Death while you're playing Grand Theft Auto.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.760]   So when I had the Red Ring of Death playing Halo 3
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.960]   and sent it back, right at that moment,
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.320]   I don't know if it's a coincidence or what,
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.680]   but I guess my credit card expired.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.480]   I didn't know 'cause I didn't have the Xbox,
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.920]   so I couldn't play live anyway.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.000]   So they canceled my account.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.600]   Now it turns out all the points I had on my account
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.040]   are kind of off with that account,
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.920]   so I had to create a new account,
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.600]   so Henry could kill people in real life in Call of Duty 4.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:27.240]   So I'm a little bit jaded on the Xbox 3.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.400]   - Xbox Live definitely has issues like that.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.760]   Like if it expires, it's just a nightmare.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.160]   - It's really annoying.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.960]   How, but 'cause Major Nelson said he'd help me out,
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   but I said, I don't want your help.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.080]   I wanna see what it's like if you're not, you know,
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.480]   if you're not getting help from Major Nelson.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.240]   - To, will have you seen this Ultimate Gaming Share?
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.920]   Have you, anybody seen that Ultimate Gaming Share?
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:45.960]   - What's that?
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.240]   - It's a, it's this really cool chair
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.600]   that you plug your Xbox or maybe even your--
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.320]   - Oh, it's a rumble chair, a rumble seat.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.160]   - Oh yeah.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.880]   - But it has ground lighting and it has speakers in the head.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.000]   - Oh, we're getting one of those.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.160]   Gotta have one of those in the studio.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.600]   - Oh, gotta check it out, it's great.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.440]   - It's great.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.280]   - Who makes that?
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.120]   - Who makes it?
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.240]   - You need to put one of those in like a sort of pimp ride
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.080]   kind of thing.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:04.920]   - Yeah.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:05.960]   - I had this Ultimate Gaming Share.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   - Well, I wanted to have a steering wheel on my desk,
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.680]   but maybe I could just have the Ultimate Gaming Share
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.720]   while I do the show.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.880]   That's good, I'm writing it down right now, I'm getting that.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.000]   So did you see NPD had some numbers on Blu-ray player sales?
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.080]   From January to February, player sales,
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   this is after HD DVD, you know, bit the dust,
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.120]   player sales for Blu-ray in the first month
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.960]   went down 40% month to, they went up a mere 2%.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.440]   So they're not selling these things.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.360]   - Is that including the PS3 though?
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.200]   - Yes.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.040]   - It's not.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:38.880]   - It is not including the PS3.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   - Oh, 'cause the PS3 is 80% of the player sales.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.480]   So if they don't include that, then that says bogus stat.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.320]   It's not--
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.520]   - Those numbers are, well, the story I read about it said
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.120]   it was excluding PS3 sales.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.160]   - Well, that's worthless, I'm sorry.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.280]   - Which have not been, I think they had one month recently.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.760]   The PS3 sales though haven't been,
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.760]   they are not the number one selling console according
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.880]   to those same, you know, they do those monthly
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.240]   video game console releases.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.600]   - Don't you think GTA will help?
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.720]   And then when Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid,
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.840]   I can't talk anymore 'cause I'm so excited.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.560]   Four comes out that that's gonna help too.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.840]   I mean, they just don't have a game.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.680]   - GTA Four will help, but because it's not an exclusive title,
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.400]   I don't think it's gonna be a gigantic bomb.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.760]   - Metal Gear Solid is.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.400]   - That's Metal Gear Solid, I think you'll see it, you know,
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.640]   be the top selling console for a couple of months, but.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.280]   - Well, there must be a little peeved
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.640]   because GTA used to be a Sony franchise.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.840]   - No, it was a PC franchise originally.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.040]   - Oh, okay.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.400]   And then it was a PS2.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.640]   - The first two installments, the first--
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.080]   - Yeah, the Spy Hunter version.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.240]   - The console PC.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.080]   - Yeah, they were all Spy Hunter.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.320]   - Then it went to PS2 and then it came on like later
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.200]   on the Xbox and now Microsoft just paid so much money
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.040]   to get it then.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:45.880]   - That's kind of a coup.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.920]   - That makes a big difference, isn't it?
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.760]   That's a smart one.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.120]   - Yeah, man, I remember playing the first GTA
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.680]   and that was pretty unbelievable at the time.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.600]   - It was top down, right?
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.640]   It was like Spy Hunter.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.800]   - Yeah, and you had this fantastic camera
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.360]   that sort of zoomed in and out as you went to pace
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.680]   and it was fantastic.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.440]   - All right, hey, I wanna wrap this up.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.640]   I really wanna thank you all.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.880]   It's been your first time on Andrew and you were great
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.760]   and I really appreciate you taking the time this afternoon
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.600]   to do it.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.440]   - My pleasure, thank you.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.280]   Nice meeting everybody.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.160]   Andrew's podcast is the Discipline Investor.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.760]   What's the website, Andrew?
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.240]   - Thedisciplineinvestor.com.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.840]   - Okay, and of course it's on iTunes too
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.720]   and it's a really interesting show and the book is good too
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.840]   and we can't wait to see it on Audible.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.040]   We'll make it a recommendation for sure when it comes out.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040]   - Great, thanks, thanks so much.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.040]   I really appreciate your time, thank you, Andrew.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.680]   - You're welcome.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.200]   - Will Harris, how's it going to channel Flip?
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.360]   - Oh, we are very close to something pretty cool.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.880]   So-- - You said that last time.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.400]   - No, I know and if I could make lawyers work faster,
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.240]   I would.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.840]   - Oh, it's the lawyers, huh?
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.560]   - Yeah, as soon as you get into anything with lawyers,
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.000]   you're slow.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.280]   But in the meantime, people can follow me at Twitter.com/
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.880]   - I'll forget you, I'm following Catherine.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.600]   - Yep, Catherine Fletcher, she's huge.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.160]   - I need to get her on Twitter, don't I?
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.480]   - She's adorable.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.000]   - She's pretty good.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.880]   So we're gonna do, yeah, that's gonna be back very soon
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:13.720]   and some very, very cool news about that soon after that.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.960]   So just give me like a week, give me like a week
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.720]   and you'll see the cool lips.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.400]   - Who do you, now you don't do live streaming.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.120]   But who are you using as your back channel?
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.440]   I mean, this video looks good,
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.440]   this wide screen video looks very good.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.400]   Are you doing that yourself or you have a host?
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.680]   - The channel Flip? - Yeah.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.640]   - Yeah, we were just using previously a Flip TV.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.000]   - Oh, it's Flip TV?
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.120]   - Yeah. - Looks really good.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.600]   - They have a, they have a, when we set it up initially,
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.320]   you know, we had like a week to put together
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.840]   the entire backend infrastructure.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.980]   And we were like, "Lip has this just this great
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:48.000]   kind of 10 key solution for doing this kind of stuff."
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.960]   - That's cool. - Pretty cool.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.520]   - Very cool.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.640]   - Of course, if you wanna watch TV,
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.800]   you really should watch Buzz out loud and CNET TV
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.120]   'cause that's where you're gonna see the lovely
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.720]   and talented Molly Wood.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.480]   - Soon to be on Yahoo too.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.320]   - What?
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.600]   That's right, you made a deal, I forgot.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.040]   There's a little, mm-hmm.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.520]   - There was some intrigue for a moment
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.560]   like Wood Microsoft by us too.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.920]   - Yeah, that wouldn't be good.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.280]   - No, yes.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.320]   - Actually, maybe it would be good.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.920]   - It'd be all over, that's gonna be a fire hose of eyeballs
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.240]   for me, I'm a little afraid.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.320]   - Fire hose of eyeballs for Molly Wood.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.960]   - I might have to get a little new hairdo
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.440]   (laughing)
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.560]   for my Yahoo debut.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.400]   - Where will they go?
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.840]   Is there a special Yahoo page for this or?
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.960]   - I don't know actually.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.400]   I think that-- - Seeing that made a content,
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.320]   a three year content sharing deal with Yahoo,
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.600]   just for folks who didn't know.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.760]   - Yes, and it's my understanding that the Yahoo tech sites
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.880]   will become the conduit for the CNET content.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.440]   - You're baby crying, he's mad at you.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.320]   - I know, he really wants Molly.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.440]   - Go, go, go, Mommy, and thank you for going
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.160]   the Maker Fair for us, we appreciate it.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.640]   - Thanks for having me, sorry about all the stick 'em mess up.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.040]   - No, it wasn't a mess up.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.000]   - Next time, Molly. - We just never saw you.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.280]   - I know, I never got to wear a try like 50 times.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.080]   - There was some girl in her underwear on there,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.600]   but I don't think that was you, was that?
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.200]   - Me, me, no, no.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.520]   - All right, thank you, Molly.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.960]   - All right, thank you.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.280]   - Go take care of the baby.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.440]   That was you.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.880]   - That was me, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.480]   - That was your bulldog.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:16.200]   You don't dress your bulldog in clothing, do you?
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.040]   - Of course not, what do you think of?
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.600]   Some like bulldog maniac?
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.440]   (laughs)
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.400]   I mean, they do have Twitter accounts, but.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.880]   (laughs)
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:26.120]   - It's Taurus Callicanis, and what's the other one's fondue?
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.040]   - Fondue, calicanis.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.560]   - Fondue?
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.400]   - Fondue.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.560]   - Like cheese dip?
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.120]   - Because she melts your heart.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.520]   - Aw, she melts my cheese.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.440]   (baby babbling)
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.760]   - Now, now, you wanna make any announcements
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.680]   about Mahalo Idol?
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.760]   You've been looking for a replacement for that lady.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.080]   - Oh, yes, we're trying to,
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.040]   well, you know, you can't really replace Veronica.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.400]   She's a star in her own right, so.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.560]   We're trying to carry on without her,
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.920]   and we query the audience, and they said they wanted to,
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.560]   sort of, we said, do you want us to try to go after
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.280]   like an established web celebrity?
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.640]   And the cog, then.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.480]   - No!
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.320]   - What up?
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.720]   - God, by the way, can I just say one thing?
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.280]   Did you see Amanda Cogdon's trailer
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.880]   for whatever that thing she's doing?
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.400]   - I don't understand what that was.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.800]   - That was the worst. - I didn't look at that.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.640]   It was really with me.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.760]   - It was god awful.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.880]   It seemed like the ad was really Amanda in a tank top.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.720]   That's all you need to know.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.560]   And then like.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.600]   - She was trying to make fun of the fact
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.800]   that people like, call of the rack and stuff like that.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.280]   - Excuse me, there was, you know, she says,
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.160]   I'm gonna do a sketch comedy podcast.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.340]   Well, you gotta get the comedy.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.360]   (drum roll)
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.200]   That would be kind of.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.120]   - We're going to industry, we're in.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.840]   - Yeah, start with the comedy, the rest will follow.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.080]   All right, I'm sorry, I don't mean to diss her,
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.320]   but I mean, I've yet to see her do anything very interesting.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.840]   And I'm glad you decided not to go that way.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.720]   Where else could you go?
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.760]   You're gonna get somebody completely new?
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.400]   - We had 100 or 75 to 100 people come to the office
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.240]   for an open call.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.800]   We narrowed it down to 20.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.480]   So at daily.mahala.com, we're showing the 20 go down to 12.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.880]   Then those 12 went down to six.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.080]   Those six are gonna either go down to one
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.400]   or maybe we'll--
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.720]   - But Lon's gonna, Lon Harris will still be part of it.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.640]   - Yeah, Lon's a co-host.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.320]   So we basically found, we were down to six
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.200]   and they're really amazing.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.040]   And so--
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.000]   - Lon is awesome.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.720]   He's a real find as I like Lon.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.960]   - You know, Lon is a circle because Lon is just somebody
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.800]   who was literally working at a video store,
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.800]   brilliant guy, managing a video store here.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.000]   It's like a Quentin Tarantino story or something.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.760]   Got the job here, sort of writing search results.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.600]   - Yeah.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.920]   - And then he took on all those responsibilities.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.840]   - I'm about to write an episode of
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.160]   "Hollow Daily" or "Help Out" on it.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.920]   So I started helping out on it.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.000]   And if you saw, I'm gonna get your spamma,
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.840]   which was a--
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.680]   - Brilliant.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.520]   Brilliant.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.360]   - Which was brilliant.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.680]   He both directed that and he's in it.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.880]   And he has incredible comedic timing.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.600]   So it takes a lot of pressure off us.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.880]   So we have like our male host
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.120]   and then we're gonna have a female host.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.880]   And you know, it was just,
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.680]   it was really tough for Veronica to come down here
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:55.520]   every other week.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.520]   - Yeah, no, I understand.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.400]   And there's no hard feelings between either of you guys.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.240]   In fact, I was--
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.240]   - Friends before this.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.080]   - Yeah.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.080]   - We've friends long after this.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.160]   She was just, she was here every other week, literally.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.080]   Like in a--
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:06.920]   - That's too hard.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.760]   - Corporate apart.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.600]   And it was just too much.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   And we both know it.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.400]   And she's got so many opportunities.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.920]   So I think she would rather do many things.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.000]   And we would rather have somebody here full time
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.840]   to be able to do "Spare the Moment" thing.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.720]   So it's better for everybody.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.560]   She's awesome.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.760]   - That's just the way it is.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.600]   I mean, it makes sense.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.920]   You need somebody there.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.600]   And if she wasn't willing to move to LA,
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.600]   there's no point in--
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.440]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.080]   Oh, and I was driving the Tesla all weekend.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:30.960]   - Oh, yes.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.560]   I've seen your quick video on that.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.360]   How you like it?
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.800]   - It's unbelievable.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.360]   It's like faster than my Corvette.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.840]   Totally silent.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.160]   And I'm putting solar panels on my house.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.320]   So it's a somewhat religious experience
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.080]   because your whole life, you're trained to think that
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.400]   we have to use gasoline.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.080]   And then you drive a sports car that's
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.120]   faster than the Corvette you own.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.160]   And you're going to be able to power it by your solar panels
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.440]   and never do any damage to the environment.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.720]   - Will you be able to get enough power from the solar panels
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.960]   to drive all you want?
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.160]   - Hey, well, find out.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.800]   I don't drive a heck of a lot of four miles
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.840]   between my house and office.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.840]   So in the range of the car is 225.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.040]   So I may have to plug it in sometimes.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.720]   But I'm thinking about getting two.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:14.960]   Oh, that was obnoxious, I guess.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.320]   But I'm thinking about getting a second.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.920]   I don't need to know what I'm doing.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:19.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.080]   - You caught on.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.320]   You got it really quick.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320]   You got it.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.440]   - Who's thinking about getting a second?
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.600]   - The therapy's working.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.440]   It's good.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.840]   It's starting to kick in.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840]   - I'm sorry.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.760]   - So what would you do with the second one?
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.240]   - Well, it could be charged you went
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.400]   up driving the other one.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.080]   - Oh, no.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.880]   It's just like when you buy a laptop
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.520]   and you get a second battery for it.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.600]   I understand.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.520]   Might be cheaper just a thought.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.840]   Might be cheaper to get interchangeable battery packs
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.680]   on the Tesla than you could--
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.640]   - Well, yeah, they did that.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.240]   But the thing is I can charge it at my office.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.160]   So I was thinking about putting solar panels in the roof.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.520]   Basically, these things are just so expensive right now.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.960]   - Just get two.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.640]   They're going to come out with a $50,000 version.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.240]   That's four-door.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.080]   And then they're going to come out with a $30,000 version.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.200]   So essentially, if we had the will as a society,
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.200]   especially in the Southwest--
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.040]   - I think we do.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.880]   - I think we do.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   - I'm not concerned about global warming in terms
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.360]   of cars to that and smog, because it's so obvious
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.760]   after having driven this car that we can solve the problem.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.320]   - Are there environmental impacts to the batteries
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.680]   or to building the car?
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.960]   I mean, there's got to be--
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.480]   - It's the same as any other car.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.600]   Every car has batteries, so they're
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.320]   slightly more batteries, but it has no engine.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.440]   It has no oil.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.640]   It has no gasoline.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.600]   - No consumables if you use a sun.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.840]   - It has to be--
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.120]   The small cloud over LA could be gone in 10, 15 years
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.080]   if we had the will to do it.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.280]   - I would buy the $30,000 one when that's going to be.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.240]   One's not going to be available.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.720]   - That'll be like four or five years.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.840]   But the four-door $50,000 one's going to be in a couple years.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.480]   And you know what?
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.200]   I think it's a really cool investment
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.760]   to make in the future of society,
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.240]   because I'm buying a $110,000 car,
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.960]   but it drives the price of the next car down.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.800]   You buy the car--
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.640]   - No, I appreciate it.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.480]   I'm glad you're doing this.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.080]   I'm glad you're-- in effect, you're funding
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080]   the forward-motion of Tesla.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:03.920]   I think that's great.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.600]   - That's exactly what everybody who's buying these cars
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.440]   is doing.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.880]   It's basically a political statement,
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.320]   well, whatever, it's not my big of a deal.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.080]   I was broke, I wouldn't do it.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:15.320]   But it's truly a religious experience to drive in it
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.800]   and be around a bunch of SUVs that are destroying
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.560]   the environment and think, holy crap,
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.560]   I am doing no damage driving my car around.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.360]   And the key to that, though, of course,
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.400]   is that you get the solar panels
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.400]   that you charge it from the sun.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.240]   - Even if you're--
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.160]   - It's much more efficient to take the--
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.360]   - Even if you're plugging it in.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.160]   - Yeah, even if you're plugging in the coal-burner
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.760]   factories and the amount of mileage you get,
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.080]   I mean, it costs $4 to charge the thing for 250 miles.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.920]   And it drives like a dream.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.320]   It's unbelievable.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.440]   It's unbelievable.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.480]   - Okay, we're all jealous.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.840]   Yeah, it's exciting.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.840]   - Oh, and I'm sending you that--
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.680]   - The dash.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.720]   - Yes, the dash.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.560]   - Cool.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.440]   - You had an extra one line around the house?
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.480]   - No, this is like the thing I've been--
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.280]   - I know you were giving them away in a valiant
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.240]   but failed attempt to raise your numbers on Twitter.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.320]   - Well, it's raised it, just not to Leo LaPoure levels.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.160]   (laughing)
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.880]   No, this dashing puts the real-time traffic on your GPS.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.720]   You'll see when you get it.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.560]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.400]   - I can't wait.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.480]   - So I help the CEO out with their blogging strategy
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.040]   and give some advice, he sent me five of them.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:16.880]   So I'm like, I'll send it to him.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.720]   - Well, thank you, I'll take it.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.960]   I'll talk about it.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.920]   We'll demo it here.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.600]   - I'm gonna get them to give one away to the Twitter audience.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.520]   - That's a great idea.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.120]   We'd love that, yeah.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:27.920]   - I don't know how to do it.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.120]   Have you ever done a giveaway on the show?
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.360]   - No, no, we did.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.720]   Well, we never gave it away.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.440]   We had a contest in the beginning of the show to name it.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.000]   And nobody came up with this week in tech,
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.520]   so technically nobody won it.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.160]   And then about it, the prize was,
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.960]   Patrick Norton was gonna donate a box of his junk.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.800]   We called it the Box of Crap,
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.640]   which is wires and whatever he had in the garage.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.280]   That was the prize.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.120]   And people wanted it, but then we never gave away
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.680]   'cause nobody really took it away.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.720]   - I just gave a crap in a box and I--
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.240]   - That's it, everything I wanted.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.200]   - I'm gonna come up with a goddamn name, okay?
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.200]   - It's called crowdsourcing.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.560]   It's really terrible.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.840]   It's a terrible, terrible thing,
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.920]   but that's the only way I can get this thing off the ground.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.600]   So we just have our viewers help us out.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.840]   So, but nobody won, but then a year later,
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.200]   I think it was a year later maybe,
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.360]   that I sent emails to all the people who came close,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.880]   like this week in geek and none of them wanted it.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.240]   So, we--
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.400]   - I don't want it, John's crap.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.240]   - Was John's, it was--
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.080]   - It was a bunch of uncorable--
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:27.920]   - It was Patrick's.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.760]   It was Patrick's.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.920]   - What?
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920]   What call would you people?
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.760]   - It was really good.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.880]   - I took me seven minutes to fill that box of crap.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.480]   - Out of wires and stuff like that.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.960]   I don't know what was in it.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.160]   There was old stuff.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.920]   If you, no, let me, Jason, if you did this,
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.600]   if you said, look, I'm gonna put together a box
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.600]   just of cast-offs.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.200]   Who knows, there might be a Tesla in there.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.680]   We don't know what's in there.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.440]   People, Jason's cast-offs, people would love to win that.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.480]   - I'll give away the dash.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.080]   I just, you have to come up with a way,
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:55.920]   I have an extra one here.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920]   I'll give it to the two, but usually you know--
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.000]   - No, it's too complicated.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.320]   I can't figure out how to do it.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.640]   - Then you can't figure it out either.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.840]   - There's too many people.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.920]   - Yeah, no, I do have a registration system.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.200]   I don't wanna get too involved in that.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.520]   Not every, you know, we do have donors who are registered.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.800]   I could pick a random from the registered donor.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.640]   Should I do that?
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.560]   - Yeah, I mean, that would be--
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.920]   - All right, we'll do that.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.680]   I will, I will figure, I'll have to write a program
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.160]   or something 'cause it's a lot of people.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.000]   I'll pick a random--
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.400]   - I'll tell you what, I'll pick somebody
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.800]   with the first name of Jason.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.520]   Randomly, so it's only, can only how many donations
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.360]   are from Jason's?
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.520]   - Yeah, give me a number.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.520]   Jason number what?
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.760]   - Jason number five.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.200]   Jason-- - Oh no, there's many, many, many more, Jason's.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.240]   There's thousands of Jason's.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.080]   You could pick a number.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:37.920]   - Are you Jason's?
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.600]   - Yeah, well maybe not thousands.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.920]   All right, you're right, Jason five.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.280]   Come to think of it.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.120]   What am I not--
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.040]   - No, there's thousands of people on the list,
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.360]   I don't know if it's thousands.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.440]   - Not probably not thousands.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.240]   All right, Jason, the fifth Jason
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.880]   to have registered at Twit will,
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.240]   and this is done, I mean, it's too late.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.000]   You've already, whoever it is has already done that
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.080]   probably two years ago.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.320]   - Oh, so congratulations on having a great name
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.560]   and I'll send you the dash to your best.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.480]   - All right, and I'll get you that,
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.280]   I'll figure out, I'll get you the email address
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.120]   and you don't have to track damage.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.200]   - I just pick somebody random,
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.840]   just ask somebody their name and put it in there.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.920]   - It'll be somebody named Jason.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.000]   - Well, it's not at the both of you, it's fine.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.480]   (laughing)
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.840]   - Thank you, Jason.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.720]   Mahalo, Daily, when are you gonna announce the winner?
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.600]   - Well, we're gonna drag it out as long as the ratings
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.040]   keep going up, so that means it could be anywhere from three.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:19.880]   - Maybe never.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.080]   - Two weeks and eight.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.880]   - And you're down to, last, you're down to,
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.400]   you said five?
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.800]   - Well, we went from 12 to six.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.640]   - Six.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.240]   - And then we're gonna have the six each produce
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.760]   their own standalone episode of Mahalo Daily.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.400]   Then we're gonna watch those six episodes,
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.560]   we're gonna give the public those six episodes,
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.880]   then the public will vote,
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.320]   and then somehow we'll either go from six to one,
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.440]   or we might go six, five, four, three, two, one,
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.320]   and eliminate them one a week, or we might go from six to three.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.120]   I mean, we started basically with the final six,
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.600]   we said we're gonna pay you to do each show,
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.880]   because it's not fair for everybody to work for free.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.160]   - Yeah, and they're all good, I'm sure.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.240]   I mean, if you, if you,
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.080]   - Incredible.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.320]   - I can't believe the talent level.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.520]   And they, you know, one of them's like,
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.840]   I'm a web designer, the other one's like,
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.320]   yeah, I've got this many Twitter friends.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.480]   I mean, they're savvy, so, you know--
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.160]   - I think this is the most important takeaway
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.960]   from all of this, you know, mainstream media is,
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.360]   oh, there's not enough telling to people out there.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.240]   And what's happening with this internet revolution
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.720]   is there are so many talented people.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.240]   And you people like Lon are just waiting for a chance,
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.360]   and that's what the internet gives them.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.880]   I mean, it's an expensive production,
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.720]   free distribution, that's what the internet gives them.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.760]   - Lon's gonna wind up being on Mad TV or some city,
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.240]   or some kind of little gym,
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.280]   and you know, he just came in the front door
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.560]   from a Craigslist ad, and it has to be--
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.640]   - Just shows you.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.760]   - Just shows you.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.240]   Thank you, Jason, have a great week.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.440]   Thanks for joining us once again, really appreciate it.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.800]   And finally, my buddy, Milhares from Channel Flip,
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.240]   we're gonna say goodbye to you.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.920]   Things going well on Channel Flip.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.080]   We'll make an announcement soon.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.480]   We'll talk to you later, take care.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.320]   Another Twit.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.320]   - This is amazing.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.320]   - This is in the can.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:16:02.440]   - Another thing we're probably gonna do is expand my window
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.400]   to 16.9, so we'll take away two of those screens,
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.000]   the little screens, and my window will go bigger.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.720]   - I talked to my agent about that,
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.280]   because you're getting a wide screen,
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.320]   and I'm getting the rest of us are relegated.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.760]   Shouldn't we all get landscape?
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.480]   - You want landscape too?
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.320]   I'll talk to 'em.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.600]   The problem is pretty soon the client gets bigger and bigger,
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.960]   and you have to have a 30 inch screen
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.680]   to see what we're doing.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.520]   - Exactly, I'm on a third.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.360]   - Me too, but not everybody is.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.280]   We shouldn't have to require that.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.280]   - That's not standard?
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.860]   - I'm on a Twit.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.700]   - I'm on a Twit.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.560]   - All right, doin' the Twit, baby.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.400]   Doin' the Twit.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.280]   - All right, doin' the Twit, baby.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.120]   - Doin' the Twit.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.000]   - All right, doin' the Twit, baby.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:48.840]   - Doin' the Twit.
