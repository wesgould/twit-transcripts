[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.440]   Ford invites you to drive one at a dealer near you.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.640]   Hello and happy holidays from all of us here at Tuit.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.520]   I'm Leo LePorte.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.080]   And well, frankly, we didn't really
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.640]   want to work the week after Christmas.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.680]   So we're just going to do a best of episode this week.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.360]   And since we're a podcast, it really
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.680]   doesn't make a lot of sense just to rerun stuff.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.720]   So we asked you, as you may remember,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.040]   for your favorite moments from the year gone by.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   There's some good ones in here.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.640]   Felicia Day accidentally revealing her wow account.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   That moment with chat roulette.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.280]   And let's not forget when Amber had her technical difficulties.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.040]   So without further ado, let's get to the best of Twit.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.280]   And happy holiday, Mala was at Tuit.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.320]   Also with us from boinboing.net, the great Jenny Jardin.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.040]   It's so good to see you, Jenny.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.000]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.680]   For joining us.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.600]   She's not drinking.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.360]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.960]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.320]   I got my nails done, especially for the show.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.280]   She's got some bizarre fruit.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.880]   What is that?
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.120]   I think it's called the hand of Buddha, Mano de Buddha.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.760]   But maybe some of the Twit audience
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.040]   can tell me exactly what it is.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.080]   I like to call it full of fruit.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.280]   Yes.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.120]   She's got the nose.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.000]   Have you tasted it?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.840]   It looks citrusy.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.000]   Is it citrusy?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.960]   If I can put on a wine snob adjective flow for a moment here,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.320]   it's like a really fine, fresh lemon
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.440]   with hints of jasmine and undertones of fruitcake.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.080]   And undertones of death.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.160]   I want it.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.640]   I love Cthulhu.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.120]   I want it.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   Well, Cthulhu entices you into your death.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.960]   That's right.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.760]   And big deal-- no, but my very serious point
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.560]   is-- and I'm with you, Brian, on this--
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.160]   is that that's-- I think that's going to be progress.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.080]   When people just go, this is how we are.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   And it's not--
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.520]   This is a passive attitude toward privacy,
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.120]   which is going to ruin this country.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.640]   That's why people are walking through that x-ray device.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.680]   They don't give a crap that they're getting essentially
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.840]   a chest x-ray.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   I got a violin.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.760]   And they get patted down and their nuts get grabbed.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.720]   Nobody can play.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.320]   I have my nuts grabbed and I was not excited about it.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.440]   It's got a two-two guys.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.400]   Look, look.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   No.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.520]   OK, well, let me say two things.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.960]   First of all, first of all, I'm with you on the x-ray thing.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.320]   If I have to choose between the peep show
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.520]   and getting felt up, I always choose being felt up.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.480]   It's awkward, and they're ashamed to do it.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.920]   And that's the way in a vision of privacy.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.280]   You want to make a feel bad.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.080]   That's right.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.600]   That's right.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.520]   You are grabbing my junk, and it's awkward for both of us,
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.800]   and that's how it should be.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   But let me say, when I'm trying to say about the warts
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.360]   and all and understanding who people are,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.080]   this is a manifestation of the high definition culture
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.120]   that we're joining into.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.360]   And it's not just our privacy on Facebook.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.040]   It's the fact that we watch high-def TV,
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.560]   and you can see the zits on people.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.040]   You can see the makeup that Jay Leno's
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.960]   wearing on the tonight show.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.480]   Because the truth is--
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.000]   We see things the way they actually are.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.240]   In the first 100 years of media, it polished people.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.520]   It made it lied about people.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.560]   And I think that we all agree that the magazines and television
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.600]   and movies created a false standard that was unattainable,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.800]   and has caused great pain for normal people
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.760]   for the last 100 years.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.040]   Media has misused its ability.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   This is an opportunity for media to say--
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.400]   And this is kind of what we do here.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   Boy, this is warts and all media, if you ever have.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.800]   This is like a false argument.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.680]   You're equating somebody's having a lot of makeup
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.920]   on a TV show with the 250-line scan with the invasion
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.120]   of personal privacy.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.600]   Even with--
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.360]   No, no, I'm not.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.840]   I'm not.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.120]   I'm not.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.040]   Because I am fundamentally opposed to the X-ray machines.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.200]   And in fact, they had recently--
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.520]   or is it coming up?
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.160]   Wednesday, November 24, 2010 is National Opt-Out Day.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.040]   Now, most people don't know, on the X-ray machines,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.480]   you can always opt out.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.840]   All you have to say is I opt out,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.880]   and then they give you a pat-down search.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.200]   And then if we all did it--
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.760]   I do that all the time, regardless.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.680]   Well, listen.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.160]   Well, maybe.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.760]   When I just flew here this weekend,
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.400]   I wore the same sweatpants that I wore last week to go to LA.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.720]   This weekend, when I came in, he's like, oh, they just
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.000]   changed the rules this week.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.280]   Do you want a private screening, or do you
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.200]   want us to patch you down out here?
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.480]   And I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.720]   He's like, well, do you want us to take you in the backroom,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.000]   or do you want us to do it out here?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.480]   What does it entail?
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.800]   I have to go in your waistband, put my hand down your pants,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.040]   like do it out here.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.040]   And I stood in front of everybody, and he did it.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.280]   What's the alternative?
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.200]   Can I go through a machine?
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.720]   No, no.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.680]   No, the alternative is for him to go in the back room.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:50.400]   He's going to put his hands down your pants no matter what.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   When did this happen?
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   This weekend.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.960]   They're required to put their hands down your pants.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   He's changed the rule.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   He put his hands on his hands.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   You're going to be like, no, I'm not here.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.320]   You're not necessarily pulling it.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.080]   This is the line of my TSA is that you have to get--
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.160]   If you're wearing sweatpants or baggy clothing--
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.200]   Oh, baggy clothing.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.040]   I was wearing sweatpants.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.640]   They're not baggy.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.560]   They're sweatpants.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.080]   You put his hand-- this is my waistband.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.880]   Because I got to tell you, if I have to get somebody
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   in my pants, I'm not flying.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.400]   And if I--
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   And if I have to get my pants, I'm not flying.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   I'm not flying around the ring of my waistband,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   and then pat it in the front.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   Oh, geez.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.160]   And then pat it in my butt and in my crotch.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.480]   And you know, it's all security theater.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.840]   It does absolutely nothing.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.400]   That's the part that kills me.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.000]   Is that for all of the federalization,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.600]   and for all this giant bureaucracy,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.000]   for the $5 that you have to pay for every single flight,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   going and coming back everywhere you go,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.840]   we get not 1 percentage point bump.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.360]   And he kills--
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.560]   And the guy was embarrassed to do it.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.760]   He says, sorry, like five times.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   He's like, well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.400]   Excuse me, but would you like that job?
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.840]   No.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.560]   Horrible job.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.080]   And I ran it-- oh, you know what's funny?
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.440]   Anyone who follows my Twitter feed--
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.560]   Jenny, just-- you know, I apologize.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.560]   I just want to apologize.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.880]   I didn't realize that this broadcast was
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.200]   going to be about warts, man booms.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.520]   I am so sorry.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.520]   I am so, so sorry.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.600]   It's just an ex-somer.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   I just don't know what to say.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.400]   Later, we'll talk about poking the queen.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   But first--
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.120]   There's one item that I wanted to make sure we did talk about.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.440]   And I don't know how much time we have left,
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.440]   but I don't even know what time is it.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.240]   OK, we got time.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.760]   We got time.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.560]   Good.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.520]   Holy cow, did I not--
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.600]   The bottle is not empty.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.560]   We got time, dude.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.600]   I absolutely love Jenny's post about damn you autocorrect.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.360]   That is the greatest website on the Facebook planet.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.040]   It is so funny.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.320]   I meant to read this on the radio show,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.880]   because everybody identifies with this.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.560]   Tell us about this, Jenny.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.960]   Yeah, so there's a blog where somebody's
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.880]   been capturing screen grabs of really embarrassing or funny
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   autocorrects that happen on different smartphones,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.960]   where people are texting back and forth to each other.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.000]   The one that I think grabbed for Boing Boing was somebody
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.840]   who said, I reached a really, really high level of anal birds.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.240]   Oh my god.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.240]   Oh my god.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   Oh my god.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.240]   Oh my god.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   Oh my god.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.240]   We got a spit take on the galaxy.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.800]   We got a spit take on the galaxy.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.840]   And I missed it.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.920]   Damn.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.840]   That's why we needed actual director.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   The first time I saw the site, I think I went to the site.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   Spit take.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   It's a ten-point page.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.120]   These screen grabs are great.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.480]   It's really, really, really great.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.360]   But aren't they all the iPhone?
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.120]   Let's face it.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   This is the iPhone.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   I didn't know one of them.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.600]   Oh my god.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.680]   Yeah, it's all Newton technology, apparently.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.360]   Here's somebody-- I guess I lied earlier.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   I feel pretty good right now.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.880]   Is that because you took something not yet?
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.960]   I ate something and did some humping jacks.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.560]   Bible study on the 19th.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.520]   I think I probably do the 11th since I have this Friday off.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.640]   I'll need all my spare ribs for school next week.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.000]   I'm traveling.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So you know, we made a game out of this on NSFW last year.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.520]   Did you?
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.280]   This is Twig.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.360]   This weekend tech.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.040]   Episode 717.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.120]   Oh, that's wrong.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.280]   Christ.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.360]   iPhone 4 has been jailbroken already.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.280]   Didn't take long.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:56.880]   Yay.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.400]   You can now go to jailbreakme.com.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.160]   And it has kind of like an all-in-one push button jailbreak.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.760]   And now it's legal.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.640]   Yeah, I'm sure they waited until it was legal.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.240]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.800]   They were very concerned.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   Yeah, it's legal.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.840]   So what is-- like my past history with jail off?
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.320]   No, they can't cut you off.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.600]   What could they cut you off?
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.520]   Sure.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.200]   They could just-- so the FCC rulings
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.720]   doesn't mean that they couldn't just say, well, OK, but we--
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.760]   Yeah, you can do whatever you want.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.360]   It's totally legal, but you know, we're not going to--
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   We're not going to give you services.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.480]   --broken your warranty.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.680]   That's the old excuse.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.640]   Oh, you can do that, but then you ruin your warranty.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   That's what Apple said.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.040]   It's legal to unscrew your cell phone.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.760]   But if it's got a little sticker saying,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.920]   if you remove this screw, you lose your warranty.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.880]   That's what Apple said.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.640]   That's what Apple said.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.640]   That's what Apple said.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.640]   Go ahead, Bertunde.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.640]   Here's my key question about this,
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.000]   because I got the original iPhone and jail broke it
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.280]   to work on T-Mobile, so I didn't break my plan,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.240]   and I loved it.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.040]   I had city apps running.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.640]   It tasted like freedom, and I like freedom.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.840]   It tastes like freedom.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.880]   But I also--
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   I just write that down.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   --I ironically felt like a fugitive,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.080]   because I was running, you know, week to week,
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.280]   month to month in fear of the latest software update.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.880]   So I'm kind of like sniffing around.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.920]   I don't want to have my phone un- jailbroken by Apple's latest
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.680]   push.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.480]   Does this new ruling that jailbreaking is legal now prevent
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.040]   Apple from undoing your jailbreak in its latest software
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.520]   updates?
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.320]   Are they still going to have that practice of sabotaging your phone
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.520]   at their own whim?
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.560]   Does jailbreaking make it work either as a phone or an internet
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:25.960]   device?
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.200]   Because mine is literally an operable brick,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.080]   and I don't know if anything else is in LA,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.120]   but I think I'm pretty close to actually swapping it out,
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.320]   because it just does not work.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.760]   I've yet to have a phone call that didn't drop.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.400]   But you don't want phone calls, Felicia.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.120]   This is a feature.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.560]   That's true.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   That's a feature.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.400]   That's a feature.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   This is like-- the iPhone 4 is like a girlfriend who drives you
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:45.800]   nuts.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.040]   She won't pay attention to you.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   She never listens to you.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.360]   She breaks everything.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.280]   But oh my god, she's so hot.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.560]   I can't--
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.480]   I can't give her up.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.520]   And ladies and gentlemen, this is why Coed Magazine
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.480]   is an as if WE is a must listen to podcast.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.920]   That's exactly right.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.120]   Can you go over that laundry list again?
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.320]   I was highly amused.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.480]   I didn't even understand it.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.480]   Dude, the iPhone is so messed up.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.400]   The reception's up and down.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:08.960]   But the--
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.120]   Have you had a boyfriend like that?
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.480]   Felicia Day, have you had a boyfriend like that?
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.720]   Oh, no, I'm very choosy.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.220]   Uh-huh.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.600]   Your iPhone 4 is your boyfriend like that.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.880]   Yeah, I mean, I'm about to give him the boot.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.080]   I mean, it's just-- it's ridiculous how much money
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.640]   I pay a month.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.160]   I feel like, you know, I should be
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.560]   able to pay a percentage of a bill for the percentage
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.280]   that the phone actually works.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.320]   Too bad that's not legal.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.000]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.080]   Well, now jailbreak is not going to fix that.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.600]   This is cool though.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.400]   You go to the site.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   And basically, it's a web page.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.120]   And it says jailbreak me.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.400]   It works on all the iPhone devices.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.680]   And you slide--
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.440]   it's on the phone.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.680]   You slide the jailbreak.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.200]   Nice.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.680]   That's it.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.200]   That's pretty--
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.840]   That's an Iphone 4.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.440]   That's an Iphone 4 here.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.520]   They want a jailbreak.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.480]   Anybody in the studio?
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.040]   I do.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.880]   I'm looking around.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.680]   I'm looking around like a fugitive.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.000]   Boy, I'm getting a lot of money.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.320]   I can't return to that life.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.200]   Nobody wants as the guts to do it.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.680]   No.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.840]   If I had my iPhone 4 here, I would absolutely do it.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.360]   I'll do it.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.480]   I'll do it.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.240]   All right.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   There's this awkward moment.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.120]   It's like, are you serious?
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.840]   Are you really well?
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.360]   I don't care.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.520]   I'll check it back it up before now.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.080]   We need some jailbreaking.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.040]   By the way, an answer to my original question,
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.560]   chat room, is weighing in saying Apple updates
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.920]   do undo your jailbreakage.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   Of course they do.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.960]   Did you ask that question?
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.480]   I didn't even hear you say that.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.240]   That's all right.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.560]   I could jailbreak it now.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.040]   And then just in fact, a new update came out last night.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.520]   It was downloading as I said.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:30.960]   401?
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.760]   Is one even passed 401?
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.320]   I don't know.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.360]   I know that I finally synced my--
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.400]   We just didn't get around to it.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.120]   Yeah, 401 came out a while ago.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.480]   So go to jailbreakme.com and safari.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480]   All right.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.560]   We'll could go wrong here.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.400]   Oh, it works on iPad.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:44.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.280]   You don't have to do it.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.120]   I'll do it to my iPad.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120]   All right.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.880]   Maybe I'll do it anyway.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.880]   Both.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.880]   You want to do this?
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:50.880]   No one--
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.880]   No one will use this.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.880]   I'll use this.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.880]   I'll use this.

[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.880]   Autonomous vehicles.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.880]   The article in the New York Times.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   Google cars drive themselves in traffic.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   I wonder if there's an ice cream truck with the Eric Schmidt not driving.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.880]   The idea behind this, Dimitri Dolgoff is a Google engineer.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.880]   I just do it because I can do a Russian accent.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.880]   Google Goff.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.880]   He's a Google Goff.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.880]   He's driving...
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   Well, no, I guess they put an engineer in there just in case it crashes.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.880]   Well, to make it legal, to make it straight legal, that would be funnier.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.880]   Just put a dog behind the wheel.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.880]   I have an engineer.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.880]   So, if you're driving...
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.880]   Now, see, I've driven highway one between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.880]   It is a twisty, crazy, scary road.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   And if I were to see a Toyota Prius with a curious funnel-like cylinder on the roof
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   and no one at the wheel, I think I would freak out.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   Well, they have to put somebody at the wheel.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   So, that's why nobody was freaking out, because I couldn't tell he wasn't driving it.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.880]   But to actually make it street legal, they did some look at the rules of the road in California
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:47.880]   and found out that you can have automatic systems as long as there's somebody there monitoring them.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   So, they had an engineer who could turn off the automatic driving by hitting the brake pedal
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   by speaking a word in one other way.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   And they said they only had to actually do that half a dozen times on this long trip.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.880]   A thousand miles these cars have driven without a driver.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   The rotating cone on the top is called LiDAR.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   It's a sensor on the roof that scans more than 200 feet in all directions to generate a rise
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   for a lying radar to generate a precise three-dimensional map of the car's surroundings.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   It then has four automotive radar sensors, three in front and one in the back,
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   to determine the positions of distant objects.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   It has a position estimator, a sensor on the left rear wheel,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   which measures movements made by the car.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   I guess it's giving you kind of a dead reckoning.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   There's also a video camera in the front windshield near the rear view mirror that's detecting traffic lights.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   And then there's computers.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   And all this for less than a quarter of a million dollars.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   I want one.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   It says seven test cars have driven a thousand miles without human intervention
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   and more than 140,000 miles with only occasional human control.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.880]   They even went down Lombard Street, which is the twistiest street in the world in San Francisco.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.880]   The only accident was when one car was rear ended while stopped at a traffic light.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   It wasn't even the car's fault.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.880]   And they also said a lot of the time when they had to...
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   Go ahead, Tom.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.880]   I would say a couple of the times when they had to take control was because a bicyclist actually ran a red light
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   in front of them, and it was harder for the car to see that.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.880]   Which reminds me.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   Yes.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.880]   Bicyclists are doing this all the time.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   Why aren't they stopped and sighted?
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   [Laughs]
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.880]   Adobe Microsoft.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   Anybody have any thoughts on this?
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   I think it's bogus.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   Tom, you covered this when it was breaking news that Adobe, that Microsoft might be acquiring Adobe.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.880]   They have been meeting with Adobe.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   Well, the actual story is that Steve Balmer and the CEO of Adobe had a closed-door meeting.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   It's reported that they talked about ways of partnering.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.880]   And then somebody somewhere speculated that maybe they talked about buying,
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   because there's one way of partnering is Microsoft buys Adobe.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   And then it just all went off for Microsoft.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.880]   My understanding of the story was Balmer made some illusion to it.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   I never saw a quote.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   Maybe I missed it, but I never saw it.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   Well, first of all, this would be a huge purchase.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   I mean, how much is Adobe worth?
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.880]   I mean, we're talking a big, big purchase.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   Not that Microsoft could do it.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   Not as much as Yahoo.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   20 billion.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   20 billion.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   So it's not an easy acquisition, especially from a company that hasn't acquired publicly any
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   company this year.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   They've done some small acquisitions that they haven't made a big deal about, but there hasn't
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   been anything newsworthy that they've acquired all year long.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   Well, I just saved it up for Adobe.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   I don't know.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   Well, the reason for that, Thomas, because they're still wiping their brows saying, "Wow,
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   we just dodged a bullet with that Yahoo."
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   We almost bought Yahoo!
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.880]   They woke up with their hangover and were like, "What did I buy Yahoo?"
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.880]   Shh.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.480]   I think it would be a good thing, actually, if Microsoft bought Adobe because it would
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.640]   concentrate all the really bad security vulnerabilities in one company.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   That's what we need to do.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.440]   It would sure help users.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.880]   It would be bad for Apple, though.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   It would be really quite a challenge to Apple because Adobe publishes some of the most, well,
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.800]   between Adobe and Microsoft, probably three quarters of the Apple software marketplace between
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   Office and Photoshop.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.400]   But it brings us to the real point here, which is Microsoft trying to shove phone seven down
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.920]   everyone's throat.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.520]   Anybody think of, have any thoughts on where that's headed?
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:28.080]   We're going to cover, we've decided to cover, even though I have to get up very early in
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.840]   the morning to do it because it's 6.30.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.840]   In New York?
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.920]   Yeah, it's 6.30 Pacific time, 9.30 Eastern tomorrow morning.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.000]   Microsoft will stream this live.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Tom, you want to come in early?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   You don't have to.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   I'll be sitting here.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   I missed that email.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.600]   Yeah, I'll be sitting here in my jammies.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.200]   Microsoft, wait, let me get this straight, Leo.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.120]   Microsoft's going to be streaming it live to the west coast at 6.30 in the morning.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.600]   This is their idea of good marketing.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.800]   They hadn't really thought about it.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.880]   They said, well, it's 9.30 in New York.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.880]   They hadn't really thought about it, obviously.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.320]   It's a Seattle company.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.680]   They're people that even work at Microsoft won't be seeing it.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   Well, I mean, yeah, it does seem odd, but we'll be here.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.680]   I'll turn on the cameras.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.680]   We'll stream.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.520]   I may not look to clean shaven, but we'll stream it live and I'll do what we do traditionally
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.640]   with this kind of breaking news, which is commentary.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.560]   Paul Therrot will be there.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.880]   And so we will get him on after the event, mask his opinion.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.640]   He's written the book on Windows Phone 7.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.880]   You know, John, everybody I know who's seen Windows Phone 7 kind of likes it.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.160]   You know, I believe it's probably a good product, but that doesn't mean anything.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.160]   It's too late.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.160]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.160]   It's a little too little, too late.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.960]   It's still probably not going to have the display the Apple has.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.760]   And you know, they're so far behind and on the curve, even though they invented the entire
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:52.160]   market, which is the irony here, they're so far behind on the curve with the new, you
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.800]   know, the new paradigm for these things that I don't see how they can catch up.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.280]   And I think it's already too late.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.360]   You know, I think they're locked out.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.560]   You know, really doesn't like Microsoft right now.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:10.360]   The folks who do Angry Birds, Rovio, Rovio Mobile, which is a Finnish company, observed
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:18.320]   in Microsoft ad, went online ad copy where they were showing icons for apps, the Angry
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.480]   Birds icon.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.600]   Rovio said, hey, they didn't ask our permission.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.320]   We aren't currently developing for Windows Phone 7.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.720]   We don't know if we will develop for Windows Phone 7.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.320]   We think it's foul play to show the Angry Birds icon in an ad for Windows Phone 7.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   I'd kind of agree.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:41.080]   The hottest app on iPhone, on iPad, and now on Android.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.280]   This is obviously Microsoft saying, hey, we got that too, but they don't.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.840]   They tweeted it's they are not presently committed to bringing the game to Windows Phone.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.200]   And the icon is being used in Microsoft marketing completely without permission.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   Whoops.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   Well, there you have it.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   Whoops.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   In a nutshell.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.280]   That's a good way to piss off the number one developer for games.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:11.000]   Microsoft sent a note to Engadget saying, it appears information was mistakenly posted
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.240]   to Microsoft's website and has been removed.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.600]   And of course, the offending logo is now gone.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.320]   But thanks to Engadget, we have a screen capture that will live forever.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.600]   Microsoft do that out of arrogance, you think?
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.840]   Ah, we they won't care.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.440]   They'll love the free publicity.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   That's right.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   Common to Microsoft.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440]   Yes.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.840]   They probably assumed, hey, we're going to be a huge platform.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.440]   Of course, they're going to develop for us.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.800]   Well, there is a story that goes along with that.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   If you want to hear it.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   Yes, I do.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   So when we licensed PC Magazine to Brazil for the first time, I went down there and
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.280]   hung out with the guy who was the publisher who apparently was a world, a world class
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:54.560]   surf board, whatever you do when you have this surf board, you're not, I don't know,
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.200]   anyway, surfer, you may win surfer.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.920]   You win surfer, world class.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.560]   So anyway, he brings up the story about Microsoft because he's getting advertisements for the
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.960]   first few issues and the Microsoft guy comes in and he says, here's what, here's the ads
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.120]   I want to put in.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.720]   I want this ad, this ad, and this ad I want on page four.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.720]   I want to do that.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.120]   And so the guy says, okay, well, this is going to go, no, no, no, we're not going to pay
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   for these ads.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.120]   Ah.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.080]   And he says, what do you mean you're not going to pay for these ads?
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   He says, no, you have to put these ads in because no one's going to think you're a credible
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.640]   magazine unless you have Microsoft ads in your magazine.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.520]   Fair fair fair try.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   Did he do it?
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.960]   No, he told them to screw themselves and slam the door on him.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.920]   And did people believe that he was a credible magazine without Microsoft ads?
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.600]   He stuck around for a number of years and then now he's done.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.200]   I would be, I would be incensed by such arrogance.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   He was incensed.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.280]   That's why he told me this story, knowing I'd repeat it.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.200]   I mean, that's, that is, that is fairly arrogant.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.680]   Although it's a reasonable try.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.480]   Yeah, I guess he could give it a shot.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.040]   Give it a shot.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.440]   It didn't pan out, but you know, you can't fault him for.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.320]   You can't fault the guys for trying.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.320]   Give us a free ad.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.800]   Look, you don't like it.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   You don't like it.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.960]   Yeah, like they need it.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   You don't ask.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   You don't get right.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.320]   It's just that simple.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.040]   Uh, at the, this was a crazy day on Wednesday.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:18.000]   So Google TV announcement from Logitech, Facebook announces groups and this download
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.880]   thing and then Cisco same day, same time.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.240]   And all of this, by the way, happening in San Francisco has a, has a press conference
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:32.360]   announcing Yumi, perhaps the worst name I've ever heard.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.880]   And it's not even you and me, right?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   It's you and I.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   You and I.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.360]   So everybody's saying, um, um, uh, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.440]   if you look at the advertising, isn't this some sort of fish row that's kind of gooey?
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.120]   Oh, it's, that's what, uh, who said that that that sounded like as a bad sushi.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.640]   I think Molly would.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.720]   It's got a, it's got a, uh, one of those bars over the use.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.480]   So you know, you're pronouncing that long.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.480]   So that's you.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.800]   Well, yeah, all Americans know that, but what they, but they do because of Molly crew.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   Right.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   Crew.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.880]   No, it's not an oom loud.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.640]   It's a, but it's not an oom loud.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.880]   It's a long, long, you know, they, they neglected to tell us how to pronounce the eye.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:15.960]   So really, they've left it up to us, whether it's you, me, you, my could be either.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   I'd say, oomie.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960]   Looking at that.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   I would say oomie.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.960]   Well, you'd be wrong.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.960]   See that long bar over the you means it's a long you.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   It's you.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   Grammar school.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960]   I was taught that.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.160]   Why you were taught that means oo.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.240]   And then a smiley face above it means, uh, that's a short you is the smiley face and
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.880]   they bars along you, which is a oo is oo.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.880]   Long you is oo.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.880]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:42.880]   I think Tom's right.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.640]   Well, then they're really screwed up.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.240]   I would pronounce it oomie.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.240]   Okay.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.440]   Let me ask the chat room.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.540]   Are there any English teachers, six or fifth grade English teachers in the chat room?
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.060]   We have a native English speaker.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.060]   We should ask him.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.600]   Are there any native English speakers in the chat?
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.120]   I'd say is $599 for a video conversation.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.920]   Things seems like a lot of money.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.120]   I guess we really won't have to learn the name at all.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.560]   We changed your name to you.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:13.600]   Jip not only is it $599 to buy it, but you pay $30 a month to use it.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   Oh, that's 26.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   $26 a month to use.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.960]   Can't you use Skype for free?
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   Yes.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   And I seem to be right now.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.840]   We don't need this device.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.780]   I think it sounds like they woke up in sort of 1985 and thought, wow, video conferencing
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.340]   is going to be the thing of the future.
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.020]   And they didn't realize it would be done.
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:37.460]   Well, there's this mistaken belief and this is in the Skype TV as well that you want to
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:43.260]   use your television for calling people because your television has video on it.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.260]   So isn't that great?
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.260]   I'm going to call grandma.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.260]   I'm like, oh, you're not.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.260]   That's not great.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.260]   Tom, do you remember when there was a serious, I said, Leo, you probably remember this.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.260]   There's a bunch of televisions that were brought out in the 70s that you'd run your
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.460]   phone through.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.460]   And when the phone would ring, it would interrupt the TV show and you talk, you wouldn't have
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.440]   video when you would talk over the TV.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440]   It was ridiculous.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.160]   Well, it's like caller ID on your direct TV.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.160]   And now the murderer is ringing.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.160]   Ring, ring.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   Hi, honey.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   Are you doing anything?
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.440]   That was before DVRs, but you couldn't even rewind.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.820]   Now you can't call a Yumi from your PC.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.580]   We've actually bought a Yumi in order to do it.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.280]   Well, just because we thought, well, maybe if it's like maybe it's so good.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   Oh, great.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.880]   This is what everybody wants to watch.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:31.980]   You doing a limbo party with flying boxes and then they never miss a thing.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.840]   Well, I didn't miss that.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.700]   Cisco has got their heads up their ass when it comes to marketing.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:41.320]   Their latest thing, the obviously somebody has a, what's the name of that girl who was
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.880]   in Juneau?
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.880]   The actress.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.680]   Oh, those are the worst ads I've ever seen.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.680]   Ellen Page.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.860]   All this says to me is there's somebody in the marketing department who's got a crush
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.980]   on Ellen Page.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.220]   And so they hired her to do these ads.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.220]   It's adiatic.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.020]   They're terrible ads.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.380]   Let's just watch one.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.780]   Just knock down everything.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.460]   Let's just watch one just so you get an idea of how awful these ads are.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.660]   This is Ellen Page.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:09.660]   Ellen Page.
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.660]   Hey, Mayor Wade.
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.660]   How are you doing?
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.660]   Great.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.660]   Come on here.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.660]   Would you like to see our new police department?
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.660]   All right.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.660]   Here it is.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.000]   Completely networked.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.560]   So anything happening, Sue's?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.520]   She's all good.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.520]   That's great.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520]   She's a big car.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:32.840]   My local police are watching me spying spying on me with a Cisco system.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.760]   And they're showing Ellen Page how it works.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   Come on.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   Hey, Ellen.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.760]   You're right.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.760]   Exactly.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.240]   Look at here's Leo's bedroom and the new community.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   See it?
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   Live it.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   That's not the new.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   What the hell?
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   Cisco.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.240]   I don't want that.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.300]   Who's by the way, who who's that ad for?
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.620]   Is it for police departments?
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.100]   I'm glad I'm out there.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.860]   I'd hate to be an alpha.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:00.660]   So in Britain, we've got, you know, CCTV cameras everywhere.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:05.820]   And in fact, there's a there's a plan that's been taught about where the actual citizens
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.340]   can watch the CCTV cameras and report crimes and get cash.
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.340]   Cash rewards.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.340]   Oh, great.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.220]   You know, we're we're on the, you know, if you want the bleeding edge of the, you know,
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.600]   the big brother state come to Britain.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.600]   Cash awards.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.840]   Let me just check by the way and see.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   Cash awards.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.360]   277 people have now pledged to Babbage.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.200]   We only need 49,723 more.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.640]   Please, please give generously.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.640]   Give generously.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   Give to the.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.280]   It's like the countdown to Bernie Madoff being left out.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.560]   I don't know what happened.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.360]   I've lost control of the switcher.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.800]   I can, I can't get rid of this picture.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.600]   Don't me Obi Wan Kenobi.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.620]   I don't know what's happened.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.620]   I've pushed a button.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.580]   You just kind of have to watch this button.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.580]   I push it.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.620]   I, I, I, the tote board.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.620]   I can't, we're stuck on that page.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.620]   Tempotty.
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.580]   I can't do anything.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.220]   It's a special page that sticks you.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.340]   I don't know what I did.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.340]   You need to put more coal.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.340]   Oh, thank goodness.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.020]   Oh, that was painful.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.020]   I don't know.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.020]   I clicked a button.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.020]   Well, now I know.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.120]   I don't know what that, what that button does.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.640]   Oh, you should push the random button just to see what it does.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.240]   No, I accidentally clicked it.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.720]   Whatever you do, do not push that button.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   Okay.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.040]   What do you got there, Leo, that you hung there?
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.440]   You didn't hang it there for not to get some attention.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   What is it?
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440]   Oh, no.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.040]   It's just a, well, when we had a visitor from, from a Kuala Lumpur, KL as he calls it, he's
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.320]   wanted you to go to Kuala Lumpur for some time.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.720]   And you, you, you refuse.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   So he gave me this little handicraft wood placard that says.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.960]   I refused what?
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   He quit.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.340]   He told me that he couldn't get you to KL.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.340]   I've been to KL.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.340]   Oh, there you go.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.500]   I'd go back in a minute.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.900]   It's a fantastic place.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.860]   Daniel, he'd go back in a minute.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.860]   I would.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.060]   He's the host of this week in Asia, which is not an affiliate.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.060]   Is that what your show is?
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.180]   No, I don't know anything about it.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.140]   But I, but see, I don't mind if Daniel does that show.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.620]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.620]   And Leo, can you share?
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.260]   Because when I tried it, it says share across all your aspects.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.860]   So when I tried to share, it seems I can only share photos.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:17.300]   But can you share text just conversations or have you, I know I can't see if you've done
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.300]   anything.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   Maybe you haven't.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.300]   I only have one friend.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.100]   How can I share across my aspects?
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.860]   You're the only aspect I got.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.380]   It shares something with me.
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.580]   Hey, dare.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.660]   Amber.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.540]   So and I can add photos.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:37.340]   Now, by the way, it's kind of interesting because right now it's piggybacking on Twitter
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:41.740]   and Facebook, ironically, because when you post, that's where it goes.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.980]   I'm going to make that log into Twitter.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   I'm logged into Twitter.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.500]   I'm logged into Facebook, managed connected services.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.500]   Okay.
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.940]   I probably should suppose something better than hate Amber.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.380]   What do you think about?
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.380]   Derp?
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.380]   What's derp?
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.380]   D-E-R-P?
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:59.380]   Derp?
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.620]   I should just type derp.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.780]   Really what will happen?
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.780]   I'm not going to say.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.780]   All right.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.220]   D-E-R-P capitalize it.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.220]   Sure.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.220]   Yeah, that looks good.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.220]   Derp?
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.220]   Just like that.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.220]   Tell me to do this.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.020]   Did I add a photo?
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.020]   Nah.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.020]   No photo.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.020]   Let's just derp.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.020]   Okay.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.020]   So I've derped now.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.220]   Now that's going to go to Facebook and it's going to go to Twitter.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.220]   Oh, what have I done?
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.300]   Have you just told me to do something embarrassing?
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.300]   I just found it.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.300]   No, you're a meme, Andrew.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.900]   Oh, if I'd only got to know my meme.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.820]   I just sometimes used online to signify stupidity, much like the earlier forms of the
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   interview.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.580]   It's like duh or der.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.580]   Right.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.340]   I mean, we were looking for something to say.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.340]   No, this is perfect.
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:43.820]   I thank you, Andrew.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:49.020]   So now my third post on Diaspora, I mean, I think this is okay, but I mean, it's no
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.420]   different than anything else.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.140]   I'm hoping that they put a lot of underlying stuff in here and that there's a lot of stuff
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.180]   going on that we just don't see.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.100]   And of course, the ability to start a seat and I'm going to wait once they get out of
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.100]   it.
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.260]   I'm going to wait too because every time they do improve it, everybody's going to come back
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.260]   and have a look.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.940]   So they've got the right traction right now.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.660]   Look, I got some requests.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.660]   To new requests for friendship.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:14.020]   I'm Leo, by the way, joined Diaspora.com.
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.140]   So now what happens is you drag these people, doesn't have their name or anything.
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.100]   So I don't really know who they are.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.100]   That's Ralph.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.100]   I'm going to make him a fan.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.540]   See, I'm dragging him to an aspect.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.740]   I have to say, I like this part of it because you have a drag and drop.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.300]   Yeah, it's making lists.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.220]   Remember Mark Zuckerberg said, nobody wants to make lists.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.020]   This is a very easy way to do it when people ask you whether they want, you know, to be
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.420]   a friend, you can put them in a bin.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:39.700]   Well, if you get another set of invitations, Leo, send me one.
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:40.700]   I will.
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.700]   I'll play.
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:42.700]   Okay.
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.540]   Let me see if I have any more left because I had like 20, but I think that they all went
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.940]   away is what happened.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.940]   So don't ask me, folks.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.180]   I ain't got them.
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   Remember Amber?
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.540]   I mean, we just get slaughtered when we say we got invites to anything.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.940]   I remember a newsvine, 1200 invites three days of me online all night long, sending them
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.940]   out to every single person.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.940]   Whatever it is, that's still around.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:05.420]   Newsvine still around, isn't it?
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.420]   MSNBC bought it.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.420]   MSNBC bought it.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.420]   Yeah, owns it.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.420]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.980]   Amber, see you did all that work for an MSNBC.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.820]   They owe me big time.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:21.540]   Turp invites are currently closed on this diaspora pod.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.100]   Oh, there's seeds and there's pods.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.100]   I wonder if there's stems.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.620]   You can request that feature, Leo.
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:33.860]   I'd like to be a stem.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.940]   Tim Berners-Lee says Facebook could fragment the web.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.220]   Yeah, derp.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.540]   How about this?
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:44.140]   FCC wants to use texting for 911.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.900]   Oh, that's not it.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.940]   Does that seem like a good idea?
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   Well, sure.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.780]   If you have, you know, the average teenager sending what 3000 texts a month or something
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.300]   like that, they don't use the phone.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.220]   Some kids are so fast with their thumbs.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:01.500]   I am falling off a cliff.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.020]   They could probably do that fast enough.
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.460]   Maybe they don't know how to use the phone.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.460]   I don't know.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.460]   Right.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.460]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.460]   The other thing is you can usually get your SMS to go through sometimes when the phone
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.460]   can.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.260]   That's a good point.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.260]   I guess it makes sense.
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:19.660]   They also want to allow protocols for sending video and audio along with it.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.300]   So if, like, if you're at a fire, you can take a video of the fire and where the location
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.660]   is, send GPS coordinates along with your SMS.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.260]   That's actually kind of interesting.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.900]   I don't know how valuable it is.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.220]   What do they need a video of it for?
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:38.700]   The only thing they need to be careful of is, I know with some of the news stations in Toronto
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.340]   and I'm sure it's the same thing in other places is because they're asking for all of
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.740]   this user-generated content, the thing is people are risking their lives to, you know,
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:46.740]   to video fires.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.380]   And if there's a car accident, people are pulling over because they want to be able to
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.060]   capture footage and it just makes me a little bit concerned.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.060]   The I-Report generation.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:00.820]   Somebody in the chat was just wondering what would happen if you sent in a DERP and to
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:01.820]   911?
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.820]   What would they do?
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.460]   I'm not going to take a chance.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.460]   I'm not going to take a chance.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.460]   I've already DERPed the Internet.
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.860]   I don't know if I want to do any more DERPing.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:17.420]   Well, another question you ask is SMSing too easy?
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.260]   You know, we've to use 911 right now.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.580]   You pick up the phone.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.580]   You have to dial it.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.580]   You have to talk to the operators.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:26.580]   It's a person to person.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:31.820]   And it makes it harder to do or, yeah, it makes it harder to do something fake.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:37.300]   Whereas, if you just want to prank something, you just call in a man down at a location
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.940]   on your phone and you end up getting the cops and it's a false alarm.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.660]   Yeah, there's no way to gauge the tone of it, right?
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:50.220]   And I think that's, I'll tell you guys a quick little story about my old roommate Jenna.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:54.980]   Her mom was traveling in Northern Ontario and she sent us text message that said, "Bears
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.180]   everywhere send help."
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:03.500]   And this was the first text message that she was, this is the first text message she ever
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.660]   sent in her life.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.660]   So Jenna and I are at home.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:06.660]   It's a Saturday afternoon.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.100]   We obviously didn't have better things to do.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.100]   We start freaking out.
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.940]   We start laughing and then we think, "Oh my gosh, what if it's true?"
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.780]   Because we know she's driving through Northern Ontario.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.860]   There's a lot of bears and maybe she doesn't need help.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.620]   So of course, you know, I'm on the phone with the RCMP.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.260]   We try to call her, we can't get through.
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:21.420]   There's no signal.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:25.500]   And so all of a sudden, you know, like three hours later, we get through and her mom starts
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.660]   laughing her head off.
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.220]   But because we couldn't establish the tone that it was a joke, right?
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.660]   If she had called and left a message, we would have been like, "Oh, okay."
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.660]   There's no tone, is there?
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.660]   There's no tone.
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:34.660]   And so we got to know in various things.
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:40.340]   Speaking of lack of tone, I'm told now that my DIRP post has been retweeted multiple times.
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.340]   It's a meme.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:45.660]   I've created a DIRP storm on the Twitter.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.660]   That's why DIRP is a meme.
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.980]   You hear it and you just start going with it.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:55.300]   And people are saying, "This week in DIRP, DIRP, DIRP, DIRP, look at all these DIRPs!
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.700]   And it's all because of me!"
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   Actually it's all because of you.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.700]   I blame you, Andrew.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.700]   Well, you typed it in.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:05.300]   I was the more on the DIRP.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.500]   I don't know if it's good or bad, but I have DIRPs.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.500]   No, it's awesome.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.620]   Scott Johnson will be happy, they say.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.340]   I won't be here by the way next week.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.660]   Tom Merritt will be filling in for the French Leo Le Porte.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:23.340]   He is at Le Webb right now, enjoying himself, visiting the Eiffel Tower, eating baguettes,
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:27.420]   probably drinking wine while we slave away here in his absence.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.940]   But we have a great panel for you today.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.500]   Starting in the studio this time, Mr. John Dvorak.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.820]   You had some booze to pick up.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:34.820]   That's why you dropped by.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.380]   John C. Dvorak to you.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.380]   That's right.
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.740]   And yes, as a matter of fact, because I know these guzzlers around here would wipe this
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.660]   thing out if I left it here another week.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:47.100]   Well, Dvorak.com, if you would like to learn more about why you need to put that C in the
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.900]   middle and other things.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.380]   Yeah, this is for Channel.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.380]   Right.
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.380]   John Channell, the Vorak.com.
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.540]   John Dvorak, his middle name is Channel.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:59.100]   Also joining us from CNET, executive editor, is that right?
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.300]   Molly Wood, host of Buzz Out Loud, host of the Buzz Report.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.860]   I'm just going to list everything you do now.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.860]   We could be here a while.
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.860]   We will be here.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   I hope that kind of time.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.860]   Hey, it's great to be doing a show with you again.
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.860]   I know.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:11.860]   I missed you.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.660]   I'm not sure you're in the studio, but it's too rainy and I can't go out.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.660]   It's too rainy yet.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.820]   John C. Dvorak came here.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:17.820]   That's right.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.820]   But again, there's a reason that you had stressed earlier.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:20.820]   You had told me about the price.
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.820]   See, that was our mistake.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.500]   We should have told you.
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.980]   Google also ended its week-long suit.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.980]   Well, we don't.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.380]   It is probably going on for longer than week, but the rumors have been going for a week
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.660]   that they were going to buy Groupon.
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.820]   Apparently Groupon walked away from it.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.940]   I'm now thinking this was a publicity stunt.
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:38.940]   For Groupon?
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:39.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:40.940]   Or for both of them.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.860]   The deal didn't sound right.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.860]   Did it?
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.900]   It sounded weird that Google would buy a company that doesn't do anything algorithmically.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.900]   Is that kind of money?
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.220]   And for that kind of money and a make-by decision that Google couldn't do it?
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.380]   Was it $6 billion they walked away from?
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:59.140]   This reminds me of a conversation Molly Wood and I had on Buzz Out Loud years ago when Facebook
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.260]   walked away from, what was it?
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.300]   That was only a few million, I think, right?
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.620]   Yeah, that was just $30 or $40 million, I think.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:10.060]   I don't understand anybody walking away from $6 billion.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.060]   That deals with that.
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.060]   For that, I think it has everything to do with the Justice Department and nothing to do with
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.060]   money.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.300]   I think it had nothing to do with anything.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.420]   I think this was a phony deal from the get-go.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:23.580]   Groupon, by the way, if you don't know, it's pretty popular, so I imagine most everybody
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:26.460]   knows, but it's a way to get discounts, right?
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.460]   It's a coupon site.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.660]   You know, one deal per day per city.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.300]   I don't think it was bogus though because everybody else is doing this.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:38.940]   Amazon put that money into whatever that one, the live-load thing, the same thing.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:43.140]   You know, everyone is getting into a way to try to localize search results and localize
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:48.100]   reviews, so there's no question that Google should want something like this.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.660]   Maybe they didn't want to pay that much in the end.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.900]   I cannot see Groupon being like $6 billion.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:53.900]   I don't think so.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   I agree.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:53:00.220]   I heard some good reasons why Google would want to have a company with a huge local sales
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.180]   staff that could help out with assets.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.380]   Yeah, it's like 3,500 salespeople locally.
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.380]   Google doesn't have very many salespeople.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:11.620]   It kind of rely on AdSense to just work on its own.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.700]   So Amazon invested $175 million in living social.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:24.860]   eBay, bought some other company that does MyLow.com, which also does niche like localized searching.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:29.500]   So everybody in Google space is starting to play in the local playground.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:34.740]   Maybe this was a move for Groupon to get all of their competitors bought.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.900]   So they could be the only remaining independent.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.900]   That's convoluted.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:42.020]   Well, you know, if you're going to go along that line of thinking, there's also the possibility
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:46.780]   because we've seen Google do this before, try to bid something up to make some sucker,
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.540]   aka Microsoft, come in and overspend on something that Google really didn't want in the first
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.540]   place.
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.620]   And I think this may have been like one of those deals where you have the dollar bill
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.140]   hooked to a little fish line.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:01.420]   You know, and you throw it out to see if Microsoft tries to pick it up and you pull it away.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.460]   Does $6 billion for Groupon?
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:07.220]   I think everybody agreed that that was just an outrageous amount of money for this company,
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.340]   at least right now.
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:13.580]   Is this a sign that there is a bubble in venture capital in investing?
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:17.980]   No, I think it's I think it's pent up demand because there's no nobody can do an IPO because
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.980]   the Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:19.980]   That was waiting for.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.020]   Hey, you know, I bring it up when I can.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:27.220]   He just want to set me up with a slow pitch.
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.700]   So nobody can do an IPO.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.900]   And so you got all these people, they got money they want to invest.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.620]   They want to throw it at companies and they cancel.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:36.180]   They have to buy these companies because these companies can't go public and get some money
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.180]   to grow.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.580]   It's ruining the economy.
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.580]   It's ruining the country.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.580]   It's ruining the business.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.580]   We're screwed because of this.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.140]   I think there's a venture bubble though too.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:49.780]   I mean, I think there's a way everybody's over relying now on purchasing smaller companies
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.100]   to build up your portfolio.
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:55.020]   And as a result, venture capital guys are just throwing money at these tiny companies
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.860]   that are wanting to get bought.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:02.140]   And I just just yesterday had, wait, Friday, had lunch with somebody who's going to work
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:06.060]   at a startup and said, it's a warm body time again in San Francisco where they're just
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.380]   pulling people off the street, give them a hot meal, cleaning them up and putting them
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.380]   in the door.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.380]   Who is spraying them down?
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.900]   Get in the room here.
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.380]   We got to hose them down.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.140]   That's why all those startups have showers.
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.140]   It's not for the bikers.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:18.140]   It's the hose and brown.
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.140]   Oh, they're higher.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.380]   Give them a cut.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:26.940]   I think the reason there is a bubble is because you have people saying there is definitely
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.540]   not a bubble whenever they're, you know, that is the true sign is when people say, hey,
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:33.860]   they're a bubble and people go definitively.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:36.300]   No, this will last forever.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.300]   This is not a problem.
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.300]   That is a bubble.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.300]   You're starting to get people saying that.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.860]   It's like when people say, invest, invest, invest in the stock market, nobody thinks
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.860]   it's going to crash.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.500]   It crashes or all it's terrible.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.580]   Don't buy any stock and it goes up.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.900]   I mean, yeah, that's not unusual.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:55.700]   If you wanted a Microsoft kit and who doesn't?
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:01.220]   You better get it now because according to Electronista, Verizon is going to return all
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.820]   unsold kin devices to Microsoft tomorrow.
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.940]   Oh, we got to get one.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:10.020]   All online sales of the kin one and two have been suspended.
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:15.220]   Basically the kin, which according to Electronista has only sold 9,000 units.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.220]   Oh, wow.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.220]   He's not only so.
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.220]   That many?
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.220]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.220]   John Gruber said 503.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:26.340]   He based that on an anonymous Microsoft source.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:30.140]   The real question is, is this going to end up in a landfill somewhere so that Michael J.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:34.140]   Fox can hoverboard to it and find it and say, "Ooh, look at this.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.140]   A kin."
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:40.220]   The kin, I mean, I think they're marketing campaign because I've been looking at sort of.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.220]   What went wrong?
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.220]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.460]   I mean, you look at the success of the old Spice guy.
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.460]   I mean, look at that.
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.060]   We're going to talk about him next.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:53.900]   The success of that versus the kin where they hired all these actors to go out and with
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.220]   their people on Facebook.
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.500]   Shoot pictures of their up shirt, T-shirt pictures.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:05.140]   But I mean, ultimately, it's just a giant brick of...
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:10.780]   Sasha Segan on PC Magazine said, "The Kin's are miss begotten crippled creatures compared
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.180]   to pretty much every other smartphone on the market.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:18.740]   They've been priced as smartphones with smartphone data plans and they'll be sold as smartphones,
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:19.740]   but they're stupid."
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.580]   I did that part at the end.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:25.260]   So it was a miss begotten device.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.260]   I mean, it's just happened.
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.260]   I want one!
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.260]   John, let's...
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.340]   We should corner the market on Kin's.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.660]   You know, one of the big collectors I am in some kind of future.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:34.660]   I think so.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.340]   Especially that Kin won because it was so little and cute.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.340]   The little round one.
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:40.820]   You could stick it right in your bra and carry it around.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.820]   Nobody know yet.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.820]   Oh, I might...
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:43.820]   Yeah, stop worrying, Abraa, Leah.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.820]   What about you?
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.620]   I've partly revealed too much.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:51.540]   Me, the big deal of the fact that he was able to synchronize with the cloud, which I don't
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.860]   think anyone really cared about that much.
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:54.860]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:55.860]   It's like big deal.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:56.860]   You know?
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:57.860]   We really want that.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:58.860]   We want...
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:02.020]   Some months back, lose its complete cloud at some point.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.580]   And all these people had to get their phone.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.580]   That was the sidekick, the danger sidekick.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:06.580]   The sidekick.
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.340]   Which is also who's going to trust them.
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.340]   It's also been killed.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:11.340]   Well, I guess so.
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:15.620]   I would say that, you know, the automatic cloud syncing stuff, Brian clued the antenna
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:16.980]   guy from our iPhone 4 stuff.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:21.140]   He actually did an article called Microsoft's Cana Ulogy.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:25.860]   And that was the one feature that he actually said, "Look, all phones need to have this.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.940]   This needs to be in Windows Phone 7.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:31.740]   This needs to be in future versions of Android and iOS."
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.900]   It's truly like a great example of something that you just...
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.140]   That just works that you don't really have to touch.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.820]   Now, the other aspects of the can, obviously, that's why it failed.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:44.500]   But the idea behind this that, you know, you take photos, everything you do is just stored
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:48.620]   in your own personal account online that you can access from anywhere.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:49.620]   That is kind of cool, right?
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.860]   Because ultimately, at the end of the day, that's what we want.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.460]   We want all of our content on any device anywhere, anytime.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:56.460]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.140]   The problem is, anywhere, anytime issue.
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.140]   I mean, I have...
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:05.020]   Who was up in Port Angeles floating around looking for a specific place out on a peninsula.
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:07.500]   And I was using an XS1.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.500]   And the phone just...
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:12.700]   All of a sudden, there was no signal to be had, because I was in Zissum air with no signal.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:16.900]   If I have no signal, zero signal, what good is the cloud going to do me?
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.900]   And this is going to happen once in a while.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:22.300]   Yeah, but you still had local storage of information, right?
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:23.300]   Well, yeah.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.780]   But then what do I need the cloud?
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:26.780]   It's for convenience, right?
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.060]   So say you're away from your phone or say you're on someone else's notebook and you're
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.460]   like, "Oh, hey, I took these pictures on my phone.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:33.660]   I don't have to show you on the phone.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:37.380]   I can pull it up on my notebook or on your notebook or on your TV."
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.380]   I mean, it's just...
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.940]   That added flexibility is very nice.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.700]   Well, you argue for the cloud.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.820]   I just find it to be just something that's going to cost me more money.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:48.820]   Well, I don't...
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.980]   The chat room says the Dvorak hates clouds.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:51.980]   I don't hate clouds.
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.660]   He also hates puppies, kittens.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.660]   I hate puppies.
[00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:00.340]   I wouldn't argue blindly in favor of the cloud.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.780]   I just think you have to use everything to its benefits to its strengths.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.780]   Well, and that's the key.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.660]   Nobody's saying let's replace computers with the cloud.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:08.980]   It's and.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.980]   It's another thing.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.660]   I mean, the carbon I was just talking about.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.660]   So you see, it's not cloud backup.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660]   It's backup of your data.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.420]   I mean, it's not like you give up your data.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   You still have to pop back.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.420]   I do.
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:20.420]   Do you really need to...
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.420]   Backup of...
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.380]   Using the cloud for backup is fine with me.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.020]   Speaking of the iPhone, were we?
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.020]   I think we were.
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.020]   Sam Mateo.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.020]   When were we not?
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.020]   Yeah, I know.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.580]   Well, a couple more iPhone stories that we're going to move on.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.940]   I really want to get to the old Spice guy for Lisa.
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:41.780]   Sam Mateo County officials have withdrawn a search warrant issued for Gizmodo.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.820]   Remember we got all been out of shape over this.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.300]   Well, it's just like a perpetual search warrant.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.020]   This story has baffled me.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:57.380]   Jason Chen was the Gizmodo reporter who had the stolen or found iPhone.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:02.940]   Authorities searched his house in April and they wanted to keep the information that
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:07.300]   they found on those electronic devices that they confiscated.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.620]   Chen agreed to submit information that was on those devices.
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:15.940]   But the search warrant drew heat from critics and me and many people on this show because
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:20.820]   they violated shield laws that protect journalists.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:27.780]   Mr. Chen's attorney went to the district attorney saying if you agree to withdraw the search
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:31.380]   warrant, we will grant you access to the information you are looking for.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.340]   What does that mean?
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:38.060]   Well, and this is why there's a shield law because you get the computer and yeah, you're
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.300]   looking for one thing, but it could be a phishing expedition.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:45.140]   You could find maybe if this is a journalist that you are targeting, you could find other
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.140]   source information.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:50.100]   So the attorney said, look, you're going to have problems in court with his shield law.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:53.620]   Why don't we give you the information you're looking for and protect the rest of the information
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.620]   on the system.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.740]   They said, yes, and they dropped the search warrant.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.940]   Do we have any idea what information they were looking for?
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:06.620]   I mean, he's basically, I mean, what kind of information could it possibly be looking
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.540]   for that would incriminate him for anything?
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.100]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.100]   I don't know.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:15.820]   I would say that anybody has been charged with a crime.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.420]   This whole thing is sketchy.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.540]   I think that I think what happened is that react and the district attorney in San Mateo
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.980]   realized that they had a problem with potentially illegal search.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.580]   So they made a good, they made a deal.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.180]   They compromised with the, with Chen's attorney.
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.900]   I think this is actually good news.
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.980]   It means that those shields laws do carry some weight.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.820]   And, and, and I think as Mono did the right thing, they said, look, you know, we just
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.540]   want to protect our other sources.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:44.540]   We'll give you the information from about this specific thing.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.540]   Hmm.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.540]   Hm.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.540]   Hm.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.540]   Hm.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.540]   Would you buy an XS2, John?
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:50.540]   An XS2?
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:51.540]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.540]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:53.540]   You don't buy anything.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.140]   Would you accept a Nexus 2 free?
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.140]   Absolutely.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.980]   Can I get a plug in?
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:04.020]   My Twitter numbers have not gone up much because I haven't been promoting it.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.780]   So I want people to sign onto the real Devorac and get me, I got to get some of the
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:09.780]   numbers.
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.460]   It's like, John, how many do you have?
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.460]   How, how great are you?
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.060]   You have an hundred something like that.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.060]   How many?
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.060]   That's nothing.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.060]   Not that again.
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.060]   68,793.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.060]   Need more bikini photos.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.060]   68,000.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.060]   Is that your secret?
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.060]   I'm just saying.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:26.060]   That's only half of what I want to see John and Bikini.
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:32.380]   I saw O'Dokta in the towel and I'm, I'm still suffering from that.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:34.180]   I don't want to see John in the bikini.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.980]   I don't either.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.580]   I think you'd look better than O'Dokta in a towel, however.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:41.020]   And I love, and I love, so what did it?
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.860]   So John, what is your Twitter account name?
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.020]   The Real Devorac.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:48.460]   Oh, but make sure you spell.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.300]   Make sure you spell Twitter right because I spelled it with two eyes and I got a, a
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.300]   yeah.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.300]   And you get a Parker site.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.300]   Parker site.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.300]   Here it is.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.300]   No, no.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.940]   Now, you know, anyway, let's talk.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.900]   No, I want to, I want to show your page.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.900]   There it is.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900]   There it is.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.900]   What is it with the clouds?
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.900]   It's a cloud.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.780]   You got clouds on your page.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.020]   Cloud computing, baby.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020]   Cloud computing.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.220]   That's the only kind of cloud computing John likes.
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.220]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:16.820]   Let's see who John's following.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:20.060]   All, all attractive women, John.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.860]   Bobby, who's Bobby Eden?
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.300]   Oh, that's the stripper that was going to give everyone who followed her a, a, a, a,
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.700]   some, some oral sex.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.700]   Other than teams.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.700]   Why, yeah.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.780]   Hey, why not take a chance?
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.780]   What, what does it hurt?
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.780]   You asked.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:41.420]   Oh, I'm happy I asked.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.220]   By the way, she's got 103,000 followers.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.900]   She started with 7,000 before she made the offer.
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:47.900]   Clearly.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.900]   Clearly.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:53.260]   She is according to her Twitter page, number one Dutch poor star.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.660]   So John, what are you going to do for your followers?
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.660]   Exactly.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.940]   I'm going to thank them profusely.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.940]   Okay.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:02.700]   We've already gone on the profuse.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.340]   You're going to profuse all over the fusing all over them once again.
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.220]   So what do you think of this?
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:14.460]   I thought this was a really smart campaign and all it's definitely the best interactive
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:17.780]   web based advertising that that we've seen.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:22.980]   So we, we've talked before about the old spice ad I'm on a horse, which I love.
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.980]   It's like one dive.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:24.980]   Swan dive.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:25.980]   Well, and then there was a sequel.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.460]   Swan dive came out a couple of weeks ago.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.020]   Whedon and Kennedy, the agency that did this just brilliant.
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:34.060]   In fact, we did a video dissecting the I'm on a horse, how they did it.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.540]   These by piss with the creatives.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:39.980]   I'm catching up with your, your Barney video, John.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.860]   I've almost got a million views on that.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.860]   Oh, really?
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.380]   You better get another Barney video.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:49.700]   Go to the divorce and censored on YouTube and watch Barney.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.060]   That's this is your marketing strategy.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.060]   Yes.
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:59.540]   So when old spice did is they got Isaiah, I can remember his last name, Mustafa.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.380]   And he's a football player, really hunky guy, right?
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:07.380]   And they got him in and I think they must have just sat there in studio and watched
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.380]   people tweet him.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:12.780]   Well, it looks like they had him in studio for about two or three days and they were
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:17.380]   watching any sort of at tweets and they would actually do a video reply.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.380]   Right.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:21.900]   And if you go through, I mean, there's, there's like hundreds of them and there's like, you
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.420]   know, Kevin Rose and like, we talked about that last week because we know Kevin and he
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:30.260]   kind of said, get well, Kevin, but I, but there was a wedding proposal there.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.180]   Well, you know, Lisa Milano have been going back and back back and forth.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.180]   I mean, it's so smart.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:41.620]   I mean, it's the engagement factor that really has made this as popular it is.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:44.140]   Isaiah Mustafa.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.140]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:50.580]   His daughter, Haley, Santa, my Twitter saying, why is it you look so much like my dad?
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.580]   It's like my dad.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:58.540]   Well, Haley, the truth is scientists have discovered that there's a parallel universe
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:02.220]   and your father must live in that universe that's parallel to mine.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:07.100]   Unfortunately, I happen to be more successful, well known and richer than your dad.
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:12.060]   So just because I'm so rich, don't expect your father to be rich because he's probably
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:15.140]   a struggling actor who no one has ever heard of.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:19.300]   So you'll have to keep playing with those old toys.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.980]   But if I were your dad, I'd buy you anything your heart desires.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:24.980]   You deserve it, monkey.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.980]   Oh, they're kind of sweet.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.260]   So it comes up with that on the fly.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.020]   Well, obviously they have a team of copywriters sitting there.
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:36.780]   Yeah, it's a writing, such smart writing.
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:40.420]   There's the, let me see if I can find the marriage proposal because that is, that is
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.220]   really really good.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.980]   This is, this is how you, this is how you do a viral marketing.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:51.460]   Even did Reddit did, did one where they, he gave them sort of an answering machine.
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.900]   So you could just like piece together all the different numbers and create your own message
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900]   on your phone.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.900]   Really?
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.900]   So you could do an old spice.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:00.900]   You could do.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:07.140]   So why does this work with so many other social media efforts by big companies just are terrible.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:13.700]   But I mean, obviously being successful on YouTube is huge, but also just the, like I
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.540]   said before, like the engagement factor that people are engaging in this and then you get
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:21.220]   all the retweets and then you go to all the people on YouTube talking about it.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.060]   And I mean, it's just, and the writing.
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.700]   I have a thought on this too.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.700]   Okay.
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.180]   Go ahead, John.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:31.500]   Every one of these things that's worked has a sense of humor.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.500]   Yes, funny.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.020]   It's got to be funny first.
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.340]   And all the ones that are serious never work.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.340]   That's my thought for that.
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.340]   That's good.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.340]   Thank you very much.
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.340]   Thank you.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:43.340]   I'll be here all the week.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:44.340]   I'll give you another shot in a second.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.340]   Right.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:46.340]   Like Tim just saying.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:48.740]   They're not trying to push anything on your right.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.740]   That's what you know what?
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.940]   It's there you go.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.180]   They never mentioned old spice in these things.
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:55.180]   Well, they do a little bit.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.180]   True.
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.180]   I mean, he's saying.
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.380]   But in a very tongue and cheek way.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.380]   Here's the marriage proposal.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.180]   I can play it.
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.140]   On Twitter, J.S.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.140]   Beals tweets.
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.100]   Can you ask my girlfriend to marry me?
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.540]   Her name is Angela A. Hutt-Chamberlain.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.540]   J.S.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.540]   Beals.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.540]   Thank you for your tweet.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:18.940]   And I'd be honored to honorably honor your honorable request.
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:24.940]   Miss Angela A. Hutt-Chamberlain, it seems like yesterday that you met J.S. Beals.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:29.260]   But your love is blossomed from a seed into a fully grown love plant.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:34.180]   Now it's time to fertilize that plant.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.220]   This is part I like the lights, Tim.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.220]   Angela A. Hutt-Chamberlain.
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:43.660]   Will you make J.S. Beals the happiest man in the world and marry him in real life?
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.660]   The candles roll back out.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:47.660]   The lights come back up.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.220]   It'll be eagerly awaiting your reply.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.460]   Eagerly.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.460]   Ee.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.180]   It's really good creative, Leo.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.180]   It's really good.
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.180]   It's good writing.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.180]   Good writing.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.180]   That's what makes it go.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.180]   Yeah, the whole thing.
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.820]   And of course, we're playing it.
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:02.820]   Everybody.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.620]   Everybody's, I'm sure, retweeting it and sending it to friends.
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.340]   By the way, she said yes.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.340]   Oh, nice.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:12.740]   Would that work for you?
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:13.740]   I wonder.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.740]   You know, I think it's...
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.740]   Ee.
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.740]   Hutt-Chamberlain.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.740]   Fairly not.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:21.340]   Well, I remember reading, you know, sometimes people call the sports events.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:25.660]   They call the scoreboard and they say, "Would you put the merit proposal up on the scoreboard?"
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:29.020]   And I was reading, I think it was at Yankee Stadium, the scoreboard people say, "Yeah,
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.580]   we get two or three a week last minute.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.580]   Stop the proposal!
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:35.580]   Ooh, ladies, don't do it.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.580]   Whatever.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.580]   Oh my God.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.980]   I've made a horrible mistake."
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:41.980]   I sobered up.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:42.980]   I sobered up.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.620]   That's probably what it is.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:51.180]   Anyway, so I think success and congratulations to Isaiah Mustafa, who has now been on every
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:55.340]   TV show and he's probably got a great career ahead of him.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:59.420]   And again, credit to really the creative behind this at Weeten in Kennedy because they
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.780]   did a great job.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:03.780]   That was fun.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:07.220]   You know, Lisa Bettany's been a longtime friend of the show and I have some very good
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.220]   news.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:11.740]   Lisa and I are going to do a photography show with some of our favorite photographers, including
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:15.740]   Trey Ratcliffe and many others that's going to be coming up.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:20.460]   In fact, it'll probably be the first show to come out of our new studios, more about those
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.820]   new studios coming up in just a little bit.
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:28.940]   But before we go much farther in just a second, we're going to find out what happens when
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:31.940]   somebody plays Chat Roulette live on the air.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:34.180]   I don't know who that would be.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.420]   But before we do that, I'm going to have a sip from my giant bowl of Michigan.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.420]   Mm-mm.
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.500]   I did that for Ken.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:46.260]   And mentioned Carbonite Pro, one of our longtime sponsors.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:49.380]   We've talked about Carbonite Consumer Backup for a long time now.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:55.420]   The easiest, simplest, most effective way to back up your data, off-site, automatic.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:56.420]   You can get it back anywhere.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.620]   A lot of people started using Carbonite Consumer for their small businesses.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.740]   That's when Carbonite said, "We really ought to do a business version."
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.900]   That's where Carbonite Pro came from.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.700]   Same ease of use.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.900]   The nice thing about Carbonite Pro is you don't pay per user.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.260]   You just pay for the amount of storage you use.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:16.900]   So whether you've got two employees or 200, all you pay for is how much you're backing
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.900]   up.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:18.900]   It's affordable.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.380]   Prices start at $10 a month.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:24.740]   That gives you 20 gigabytes of backup enough for 10 desktops each with two gigs.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.180]   That's a lot for 10 bucks a month.
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.180]   It's automatic.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:32.220]   You have a centralized dashboard so you know which systems are backed up and which aren't.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:36.500]   And your users can restore the same easy way they restore with Carbonite Consumer, with
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.860]   the iPhone app, the Blackberry app, or just by logging into the net from any computer.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.860]   Carbonite Pro.com.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:52.060]   I want you to try it free in your small business, 30 days, 30 days for free, CarbonitePro.com.
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:57.500]   We do thank Carbonite for bringing us, for keeping us all afloat for the last year, helping
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.740]   us bring you this great programming.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.780]   Now back to the best of the holiday special.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.100]   Yes, that explains why I'm dressed like this.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:15.260]   We are going to find out in a moment what happens when Leo decides to play chat roulette live
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:21.020]   on the air and mirth and merriment in Sioux Watch.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:25.220]   Even my wife knows about chat roulette and she doesn't know about anything.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.220]   So I'm going to go to chat roulette.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.020]   So what happens with chat roulette is what?
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.900]   You're going to go to chat roulette live.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.900]   You can't do that.
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.900]   Why not?
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:32.900]   You think there's some naked guys going to be on there?
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:33.900]   One out of 20.
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.900]   Don't do it.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:35.900]   One out of 20 is a penis.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.900]   So how do I start this?
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   That's the tagline.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:42.140]   What it says, chat roulette does not tolerate broadcasting.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.700]   Yeah, yeah, right.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.700]   Right on.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.860]   You can use everything on the internet, have to turn into porn.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.860]   Click play, okay.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860]   Don't do it.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:51.860]   No, it's going.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.860]   You have to hit the play on the top left.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:53.860]   Top left.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:54.860]   What?
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:55.860]   The other top left.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:56.860]   The other top left.
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.860]   Leo's on his wall.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:58.860]   It works.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:05.860]   Where are you?
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:06.860]   Where are you?
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.860]   Where are you from?
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.860]   Hello, we're calling you.
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:10.860]   You chat.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.860]   You type.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.860]   Oh, you type?
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.860]   Here you go.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:14.860]   What's the level?
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.860]   Shoe on head.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.860]   Oh, they press next.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.860]   You just got more clicks than you will ever have in the rest of your life.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.740]   All right, so I'm going to play next.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.860]   So are you pressed next, right?
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:27.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.860]   Thank you.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:29.860]   You're doing this.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.860]   Oh, there you go.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.860]   Okay, it only took one.
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:38.860]   Actually, Leo, you were one.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:39.860]   Leo.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:46.260]   Oh, so I really thought this was a, and it's the same, in a way, it's the same conversation.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:52.180]   It doesn't have to do with government regulation, but it's the nature of open in the article,
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:57.780]   in the times yesterday, Stephen Johnson quotes Harvard's Jonathan Zittrain, who talks about
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.780]   author of the future of the internet and how to stop it.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.780]   You've read it.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:03.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.780]   Really neat, interesting guy.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.660]   He talks about generative, the generative power of the net.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:13.620]   He says, "When you don't have to ask permission to create and share new ideas, when small
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:17.940]   innovative startups can compete with giant multinationals, I think of us as a good copy
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:22.460]   of that, you know, I'm competing with Rupert Murdoch, even though he's got all this power,
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:26.780]   thanks to the internet, inexpensive consumer electronics, I can create television."
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.780]   Right.
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.460]   That anybody in the world can see.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:33.180]   So that's the generative power of an open, a free internet, the kind of thing that we
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:36.580]   want to protect, whether it's through government regulation, which I know some people don't
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.700]   like the idea of maybe through market, free markets, but we need to protect it.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.020]   You'd agree with that, right, Brian?
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.020]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.500]   I just love the fact that you guys both look at each other, which some people don't like.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:51.300]   Some people who shall remain nameless, Brian Brushwood, libertarian.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.100]   You would categorize yourself as a libertarian.
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.100]   Yeah, very much so.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.580]   Oh, that's why it's so fun to talk to you.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:56.580]   I know.
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:57.580]   I'm just great.
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:58.580]   I'm saying that seriously.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:59.580]   You know what a libertarian is.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:00.580]   It's just a Republican in the...
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.580]   Uh-uh.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:02.580]   No, that's not your match, I know.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.580]   It's definitely not true.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:04.580]   It's definitely not true.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.580]   Nothing's so?
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.820]   I'd like to think we get the, you know, we're just a fan of freedom on all sides.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.820]   Yeah, they appeal to a lot of progressive people, and like torture and...
[01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:11.820]   You know what a socialist is.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:12.820]   Right, but also me.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:13.820]   A Frenchman.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.820]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:16.820]   You were setting up this story.
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.620]   No, I forgot now where I was going.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.820]   The generative power of the way of the open, Wisconsin are...
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:24.580]   Okay, so then if you believe that, then you look at Steve Jobs and Apple, and you say,
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.220]   "Well, this is the opposite, isn't it?
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.220]   It's a walled garden.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.460]   It's AOL, it's MSN.
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:33.220]   It's CompuServe all over again where we control everything rigidly, and you didn't see any
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:36.500]   innovative stuff happening on those platforms because you couldn't.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.700]   It was their way or the highway."
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.700]   Right.
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.100]   Well, here's an interesting thing.
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.820]   Steve Jobs has created this App Store.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:44.940]   I think maybe against the will of Apple, it certainly wasn't their original plan.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.180]   You know, when the iPhone came out, they said, "Oh, you don't need apps.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.180]   You've got web apps.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:49.180]   It's great.
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:50.180]   You should be happy."
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.180]   That didn't work.
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.180]   So they created the App Store.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.180]   He's like, "We will never..."
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.060]   "We'll never have apps."
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.580]   I'm sure he had some reason why apps were a bad thing, right?
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:58.660]   And why you would never want them.
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.180]   You wouldn't want an app.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.380]   So people demanded an app year two, they made App Store.
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.380]   Years three, they've got 175,000 applications.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.380]   185.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.380]   185.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:16.220]   There's no one who could say that it hasn't been innovative, that it hasn't been generative.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.060]   What the hell?
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:21.060]   How did this happen?
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.820]   That's what Johnson's writing about in the Times.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.220]   He said, "Rethinking a gospel of the web.
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.620]   This has been gospel.
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:28.120]   Is it wrong?"
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.960]   It's a spectrum.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.960]   It's nothing's black and white.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:31.960]   It certainly is.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.220]   And that's sometimes a cop out in an argument, but I think in this case, it is true because
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:41.980]   Apple has opened the doors wide enough to let a lot of non-Apple innovation in while
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:47.940]   still retaining control enough to maintain a user experience that meets their standard.
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.180]   So not everybody agrees on that intersection.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:56.300]   There are people who want apps and capabilities, tethering routers, voice, VoIP in the background,
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.100]   true multitasking that doesn't meet Apple's standard.
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.180]   And so they draw a line that is closer to home than what some innovators want.
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.580]   So not every type of innovation can happen.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:08.380]   What Apple has decided is, we can't do it all ourselves.
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:12.060]   There's a benefit to the platform owners in opening up because they can't solve every
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.060]   problem.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.580]   They can't write every code.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:19.020]   And so they've drawn a compromising line which satisfies the vast majority of their
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.020]   audience.
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:25.380]   And the more purest, the more geek oriented are less happy because they love to do a lot
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:26.380]   more.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.780]   They see potential where others might not.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.820]   And so you get this frustration at that margin.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:32.340]   But overall, Apple's been relatively open.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.540]   I'm someone who's pushed for a lot more from that.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:36.460]   But I also recognize a lot of what Stephen's written.
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:39.140]   So now, let me, anybody want to say anything before I throw the monkey wrench?
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.900]   This really makes me think of the Ed Felton blog where he said iPad is the Disneyland of
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:44.900]   Disneyland.
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.860]   It's a sanitized experience.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:53.220]   Right, which is very, it's everything you wish, like just like the middle of downtown
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.580]   Disneyland is the little quaint American town.
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.060]   It's the exact picture of how you want it.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.460]   It used to be in America.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.580]   It's that everybody ate candied apples.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:01.580]   No apps crashed.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.580]   No apps crashed.
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.340]   It was no blues cream of death.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.300]   It's an interesting combination because you have this walled garden where you can create
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.220]   applications and they work really well.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.140]   And Apple has a set of standards that you develop by.
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.220]   And on the same token, if you don't like that, you can go to a more open operating system
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:19.300]   like Android or PalmOS and then you can have that experience.
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:22.500]   And it's like, do you either want to make applications that you can sell millions of
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:26.460]   copies on in the Apple store or do you want to develop something that's more open and
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:29.580]   you know, cross platform on Android or Palm?
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.580]   It's true though.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:34.780]   Let's point it out that there is a very good web browser on the iPad and the iPhone and
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:38.700]   it's Safari and you can, you can even run web apps that I can design and anybody can
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:39.700]   design.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.220]   But now here's the monkey wrench.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:46.320]   Because in iPhone 4.0 agreement, Apple did something that I think the tent poles are meaningless
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.540]   compared to this.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:52.660]   They said going forward, you may not develop applications for this platform, iPhone, iPod
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:57.380]   touch or iPad with anything but Apple approved tools.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.220]   And I thought they just said screw you Adobe.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.340]   Yeah, well, it was clearly screw you Adobe.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:02.340]   Was I wrong?
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.260]   I was reading it with what I was saying.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:08.740]   So how can they, I guess they could tell because the code generated clearly indicates
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:09.740]   what what.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:10.740]   Oh yeah.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.660]   But it's not quite as sloppy as front page making websites.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:14.660]   But front page.
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:15.660]   But that's rude.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.140]   And this is the only works.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:20.100]   You know, Microsoft could have done the same thing with Windows except that anybody could
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.100]   sell applications.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.460]   It was an open platform.
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.580]   You cannot sell applications unless Apple says yes, right?
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:28.820]   So this only works because Apple gets to say what applications run.
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:33.580]   By the way, this is a really interesting face off because on the one hand, Apple has
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.060]   first move or advantage.
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.060]   It has all the momentum.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.980]   It currently has most of the software.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:42.260]   But it seems like in the long term, I mean, I believe Apple was pretty far ahead in the
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:46.340]   PC days early on until Microsoft was completely open to everyone.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:50.620]   And I wonder it'll be really interesting to see if the Android completely open architecture
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:52.540]   allows for, I don't know, allows for ketchup.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:53.540]   I don't know.
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.300]   I think an Android tablet could be pretty good.
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:56.300]   I think it could be good.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.980]   But I think Apple's learned from the past.
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.940]   They're not repeating the same mistake.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.980]   They first of all, they're integrated a lot more.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.300]   And the big step is commerce.
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:07.940]   You know, what Veronica was talking about with, you know, you can go to Android, a palm
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:15.380]   OS, but you can't get as large a pool of money at your footsteps as a developer, as
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:19.460]   a content producer, a seller, then you can get in the iTunes apps or they've made the
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:25.300]   friction between you and getting that app and money in between really slick, super smooth,
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:26.300]   super fast.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:30.180]   So if you want to get your developer, it's pretty good monetizing that web app is a lot
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:33.500]   harder on an iPhone than selling it in the app store would be because there's no pain.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:37.540]   Plus, as Groobers said, it's really dangerous for Apple to rely on something like Flash
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:41.380]   when if anything happens to Flash and it breaks and suddenly all these iPhone apps no longer
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:45.780]   work or iPad apps, then, you know, that's going to be a bad experience for the users.
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:49.580]   I got to feel for John because Steve Jobs actually, when somebody sent him a developer
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:54.020]   sent him an email saying, "I hate this," Jobs said, "Well, read John Groobers blog post
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.020]   because we think he's got it right."
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.940]   And I've got to think that John's going, he's cringing, right?
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:21:59.940]   Oh, damn.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:00.940]   Looks like he's a Steve's man.
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:01.940]   Oh, damn.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:05.260]   And although it's a great honor, but Groobers said some interesting things.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:09.620]   Groober did in that same blog post point out that Apple, it's a lock-in for Apple, that
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.540]   Apple is, you know, it's good for business.
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.180]   He says it's mostly good for users and this is the question.
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:18.780]   Is a move like this for Apple's benefit or our benefit?
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:24.860]   I think it's for the benefit of the Objective-C developer who's price just went up because
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.020]   what you've done is made development more expensive.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.580]   So you're saying developers should like it?
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:32.180]   I'm not saying developers as a group should like it, but what I am saying is that they've
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.620]   forced the segmentation in the developer market.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:38.460]   It does mean if you're a company developing mobile software that you can't develop on
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:44.900]   one code that runs in all platforms, you're developing and optimizing development tools.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900]   That's a good way to put it.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.900]   Great.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.940]   Well, it seems like a lot of cross-platform applications, you know, tend not to be as fully
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:56.580]   featured and nice to use as ones that are developed strictly for the iPhone or iPad operating
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.580]   system.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.620]   And so, it points to the Kindle app on the Mac and says it's a, I think a turd was the
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:01.620]   word he used.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:02.620]   He used turd.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:03.620]   He used that word.
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:04.620]   Yes.
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.220]   I don't think it's that bad, but I can see where he's coming from for other things.
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:13.420]   I mean, is the case where the output with using those tools was so unbelievably bad?
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.420]   I don't think so.
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:15.420]   I don't think they just needed to protect the consumer.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:19.220]   I mean, this is clearly a, we're going to make it a little bit difficult for you.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:20.860]   How do consumers are even going to notice?
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:21.860]   Nobody knows.
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.900]   Unless something is breaking, they're not going to care whether it's something that's
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:27.220]   been developed, you know, as a cross-platform application or if it's something that was
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:28.620]   developed solely for the iPhone.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:32.460]   I mean, yeah, maybe the geeks will notice if they can't run an application between Android
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.900]   and, you know,
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:37.060]   Cooper notices that the kerning isn't perfect on an application.
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.620]   He's not the typical user.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.620]   He is the 1 percentile.
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.940]   As are we probably in that regard too.
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:46.380]   So is what Apple's doing any competitive?
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:47.380]   It's certainly rude.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.380]   It's rude.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.380]   That's not what it's still had mattered.
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:51.380]   Why is Apple?
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.380]   You heard our feelings.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:57.740]   Because it's saying essentially Adobe screw you because Adobe's been working on it, but
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.740]   not just Adobe.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:03.060]   There are other projects as well to work on cross-platform development projects that
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:08.940]   will include flash on the iPhone that will allow Adobe to get back onto the iPhone and
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.380]   Apple's basically shut the slamming the door off.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.620]   It's like days ahead of that.
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:13.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:17.740]   I think what's interesting, I've gotten to a heated but respectful email argument with
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.060]   someone, you know, I was complaining about hot.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.060]   Everything's fine here.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.060]   I'm not an officer.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.060]   We're online.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:28.940]   If you see a sudden sizzling coming out of the Tri-Cast, early Steve Jobs is upset.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:29.940]   Apparently, apparently, apparently, apparently, apparently, apparently, apparently, apparently,
