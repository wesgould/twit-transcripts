[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.000]   Please stand by.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.520]   Five, four, three, two, one.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.920]   Welcome to Twit's.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.520]   From the new Twit Brick House, I'm Leo LeBord.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.560]   And we are going to have a great show today, the first show
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.080]   we've ever done.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.040]   From our new studios to my left, I brought in all my old friends.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.800]   My old tech TV buddy, starting with Kevin Rose to my left.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.960]   It's great to have you, Kevin.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.760]   Now at milk.com.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.560]   And to my right, my old friend Patrick Norton, host of Techzilla,
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.360]   Techzilla.com, and my old partner from the Screen Savers.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.280]   And of course, John C. Devorak over on the far right.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.560]   Steve Gibson stuck in traffic.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.040]   He'll join us in just a little bit.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.320]   But I thought it would be fun because this place looks
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.800]   a little bit like the old Screen Savers set.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.920]   I don't rust in here.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.640]   There's a lot of rust.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.280]   It's kind of neat, isn't it, to re-exise that?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.880]   I've been fighting an urge to climb the infrastructure
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.120]   in here the first time I saw it.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.520]   You can.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.280]   We've been swinging off that since we put it in.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.400]   That stuff is not really something
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.800]   you want to tell me in the middle of a live broad.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.440]   How much rent buy, how much weight can that rigging hold?
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.520]   Don't want to do it.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.000]   Thousands of pounds.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.360]   You can't have it.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   Patrick could swing on that.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.880]   That's good at model.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.640]   All right.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.560]   Let's get the champagne passing around.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.440]   Are we going to pay for a bag for the bottle, please?
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.120]   So we also invited some close friends in here.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.960]   My sister, Eva, said, well, are you
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.800]   going to have a studio audience?
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.920]   I said, yeah, we could have a few people.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.200]   She said, how about 50?
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.960]   I said, OK.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.280]   So we have about 50 people, maybe more.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.800]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.160]   And I think we're going to have 50 people for every show
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.920]   in this first week, because so many people
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.200]   are going to come--
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.120]   all the way up to Petaluma, California.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.240]   Boy, a lot of thank yous go out, especially to our set
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.560]   designer.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.320]   The guy who did this studio is the same guy who
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.480]   did the Screen Savers.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   The last one is the same.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.320]   Roger Ambrose.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.280]   He's watching us in LA.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.800]   He's not here.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.320]   Good to hear.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.000]   Quit already.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.360]   He quit.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.800]   We threw him out.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.400]   He said, I can't take you people anymore.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.520]   Also, Brent By, who is running this silly little jib camera,
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.720]   he's running--
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.480]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.400]   A couple minutes ago, it was the brilliant creation
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.240]   of your staffers.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   He invented this.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.200]   Brent invented this.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.600]   Brent is an amazing lighting guy.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   He did the whole lighting on the set and just did a great job.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.640]   Ken Merriley's-- as you probably know,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.360]   Ken, he's been around for a long time
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.760]   and consulting engineer-- helped us choose these cameras.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.640]   We're using just an expensive consumer grade camcorders.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.280]   But you know, the consumer camcorders are so good now.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.600]   These are Canon Vixia HF G10s that they're high def.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.880]   You're also streaming the show and compressing the snot.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.600]   Well, exactly.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.320]   On the stream, you won't notice any difference.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.360]   But we will put out high def downloads.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.320]   And when you put out, the cameras look really good.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.000]   They do.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.720]   Look who's here.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.080]   Hey, Steve Gibson made it.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.560]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.760]   One thing I didn't want to do on our first show
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.400]   is attempt to use Vidiosaurus and have people coming in off
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.880]   the internet.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.240]   So we had everybody come up.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.740]   There he is.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.960]   That's what he wanted to screen somewhere.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.480]   I said, wait a minute.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.480]   Where is he?
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.320]   Kevin Rose is with us.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.520]   But where is he?
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.360]   Did you just rent it?
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.440]   Did he get here?
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.120]   Essentially.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.620]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.320]   Where did you get the digital t-shirt?
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.960]   That is awesome.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.760]   Is that original?
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.640]   I've had it for years.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.480]   It looks like new--
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   I just told Stog.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.320]   I'm a brand new.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.200]   So Steve flew up from Irvine because he wanted
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.440]   to be here for the opening.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.960]   Absolutely.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.440]   Your flight was delayed a couple hours with the fog.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.480]   Two hours was the fog.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.760]   And then an hour and a half on 19th Avenue.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.880]   Holy cow.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.380]   Holy cow.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.480]   19th Avenue is the worst.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.360]   Oh my god.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.200]   That's what Jones said.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.280]   You're here to go to Oakland and around.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.680]   You have like FedEx and UPS out here.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.440]   Believe it or not.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.560]   We have Mayberry.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.400]   It is Mayberry.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.360]   Welcome to Mayberry.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.560]   It's a small town.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.080]   But look, this is kind of the beauty of it
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.040]   is we could live in this beautiful area, the wine
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.400]   country, and a beautiful small town,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.760]   and still do to internet it.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.640]   Look at all these people.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.360]   Isn't this great?
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.860]   Cool.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.480]   We've got people all around us.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.160]   So what I miss?
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   Because everyone wanted to be here.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.640]   We just started.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.280]   Oh, cool.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.320]   Your timing is excellent.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.640]   I was just kind of thanking people
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   who helped us design the set and build it,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120]   and make all of this happen.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.720]   And it hasn't been easy.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.200]   But we've got such a great team.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.680]   Liz Romero in the back there.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.600]   You could just see her.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.640]   Hey, Liz, wave.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.920]   Lynn Foo, who put together the live event today.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.800]   Of course, my producer, Eileen Rivera, who's
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.720]   back in the console.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.920]   You see this is our--
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.760]   this is our--
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.360]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.920]   --by console back there.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.720]   You've got to be an octopus to run that thing.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.640]   You've got everything at your fingertips.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.600]   One person can do what basically 22 people
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.200]   had to do to make tech TV happen.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.680]   How much is done?
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's pretty-- I don't know.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.840]   Is it done?
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   I think it's done.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.760]   Yeah, the architect bailed out already.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.960]   Move back to LA.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   No, it is pretty much done.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.760]   The only thing that's left is--
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.960]   I just finished my show in the old studio.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.120]   It came over here.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.880]   So now we dismantle the old studio.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.440]   And it's going to fit in that little room over there.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.640]   That's my office over there.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.840]   And so the entire old studio fits in there.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.040]   So is the cottage shut down?
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.640]   It is now.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.320]   We will not use it anymore.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.160]   So when we do--
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.880]   You're moving out there, too.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.080]   You're moving out of it all together.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.560]   Yeah, we're moving.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   And I'm only here, by the way, because Jennifer found me.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.400]   My wife found you?
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.440]   At eight killer.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.600]   You were down at the other place.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.440]   Well, yeah.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.640]   And I was heading here.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.640]   Did you notice that I was heading here?
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.680]   I was heading here.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.480]   She looked in the window.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.240]   Are you lost?
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.640]   Did you notice there was nobody there?
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.120]   Really?
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.440]   And you never met Jennifer?
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.920]   No.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.520]   And that's so funny.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.280]   And Ozzy.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.800]   And Ozzy.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.200]   Yep.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.120]   Well, I'm so glad you--
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.200]   And so she jumped in the car and drove me here.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.760]   Oh, that's great.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.280]   It was a long drive, wasn't it?
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.280]   I could see how you could walk it.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.560]   Dick T. Bartolo said, we've got long enough stretch limousines.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.040]   He just got in the back door, got out the front, and he was here.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.800]   It is pretty close.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.960]   It's just two blocks down the stairs.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.520]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.920]   But we're really glad you could all be here,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.080]   because it's really-- for me, it wouldn't mean anything
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.280]   if I didn't have my pals here to celebrate.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040]   No, that's really true.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.720]   It's round of applause for everybody.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.120]   When we started Twit, I don't know if you guys remember this,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.240]   but I offered Patrick and Kevin.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.600]   I said, look, we'll make this a three-way LLC.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.400]   We can partner and we'll make Twit.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   And they said, are you crazy?
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.800]   Patrick said, I need to make a living.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.720]   I could feed my wife.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.840]   Kevin says, I got dig.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.960]   I don't need that.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.000]   And so unfortunately, you guys, I own it all.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.120]   But that's OK, because you can come visit any time.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.920]   We're really, actually, we're really thrilled to be here.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.160]   And we're thrilled to have our audience.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.760]   And the truth is, this couldn't happen.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.600]   Not only without these guys, but without our amazing community.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.560]   And we see the people in the chat room.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.440]   There's so many people.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.720]   We have a live stream.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.080]   How many people are watching the live stream?
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.560]   I think it's about 30,000 now watching the live stream.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.080]   Nice.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.360]   Not quite.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.400]   We don't have another one.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.320]   No one has a clue.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.720]   And there's more than 1,500 people in the chat room.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.120]   It's a great response from our community.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.360]   And we have sold over 1,000 bricks.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.600]   The brick wall is not visible right now,
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.040]   but it's right behind me.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.720]   On the other side of that gear, when you first
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.360]   walk into the entry lobby, we haven't put the bricks in yet.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.640]   But the bricks are going to go in.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.880]   We're going to get the first ship in about two weeks.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.600]   And before the opening party, which is August 21st--
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.280]   by the way, you're all invited.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.920]   We'll have the bricks mounted on the wall.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.640]   I guess that was right.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.600]   Well, that's just the opening party.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.120]   Oh, he just doesn't count.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.640]   John?
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.480]   I think he's done.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.360]   He just said so.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.800]   Those are the part where you said it looks nice.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   It's like the nicest thing I've ever done.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.320]   I'm wrong.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.840]   12 years.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.960]   I'm dead wrong.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.600]   All right, let's talk--
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.360]   I've finished.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.160]   By the way, Tom Merritt's here.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.120]   Sarah Lane is here.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.800]   Eileen Rivera is here, our whole team.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.120]   On the other side of the room where that big red X is,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.640]   that's our newsroom over there.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.800]   And Tom Merritt and TNT, they work over there.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   They have their desks here.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.040]   One of the things I wanted to do is make this not a studio,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.040]   but they're just-- so I'm waving.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.280]   I'm over here, Leo.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.960]   As I wanted to make this a working office
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.520]   that we can also do shows at us.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.280]   There's still part of me.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.600]   Like this main area--
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.120]   There's Sarah there's Tom.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.080]   Almost twice the size of the entire upstairs and downstairs
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.600]   of the cottage.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.240]   It is.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.320]   9,400 square feet.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:45.880]   How many people?
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.040]   30,000 people are watching.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   That was my guess, and I was right on the list.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.400]   So since you got 30,000 people watching,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.960]   I should mention a couple of things.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:59.000]   One, Bert Monroy's got that big picture posted in San Francisco.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.520]   So first, did you go see it?
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:00.920]   I didn't.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.600]   I understand I'm in it.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.280]   Actually, your name is in it one of the only two names
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.600]   that actually has a name.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.640]   And Pat is the other one.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.200]   That's awesome.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.360]   Bert, of course, is the Photoshop wish.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.000]   It's only going to be there for a couple of weeks,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.760]   and then you're never going to see it again.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.280]   Why not?
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.520]   Because it's only the backlit.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.640]   This is the full-size backlit version.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.960]   This is the world's largest Photoshop illustration.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.440]   He took four years to do it.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.240]   Bert, of course, is it right there?
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   Eight hours a day.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.920]   Eight hours a day.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.600]   Not just eight hours a day for four years.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.840]   This thing, backlit, is fun.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.720]   I'm down the street from Bert, so I see him all the time.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.760]   But backlit, this thing is spectacular.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.600]   And he won't go see it or else.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.840]   No, I will go down and see that.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.960]   If you're in San Francisco, you must see a Bert, well,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.640]   he was a regular--
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.240]   Photoshop day or something.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.160]   What's the name of this?
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.080]   Yeah, 550 Sutter Street San Francisco.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.480]   If you're in the Bay Area, find a way to get over there.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.000]   And it's called Times Square.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.160]   It's the name of his painting.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.320]   I'm going to pull it up here.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.120]   Yeah, I've got it coming up on a second.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.880]   It's so big, it's taking an hour to download.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.200]   The thing is huge.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.280]   It looks like a photo.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.760]   The thing is, it's photo-realistic.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.960]   So if I click, I can zoom in on this.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.600]   Oh, look at this.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.960]   It's photo-realistic.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.520]   Scroll down.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.280]   Where are we, Pat?
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.120]   Oh, there we are.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.320]   There's the Twit logo right there, right in the middle.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.360]   Look at that.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.560]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.840]   That's the old Twit album art with Leo, the poor Patrick
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.360]   Norton friends.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.560]   That's the only text names in there.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.160]   That was nice of Bert to include that.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.120]   These are not pictures.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.560]   They look like pictures of people.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.160]   They actually are real people, though.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.120]   He has many of his friends in the imagery here.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.440]   And then, over to the far left there, you find me and J.C.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.280]   Are you in it?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.400]   Of course.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.480]   Oh, there's Bert.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.240]   See his back right there?
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.600]   Yeah, it was right there.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.200]   Keep going?
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.960]   Move over a little more.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.760]   The other way, the other way, the other way.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.240]   Right there.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.800]   Oh, there's Bert.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.560]   That's his ponytail.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.000]   I recognize his ponytail anywhere.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.960]   That's his wife.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.640]   And there's his wife.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.560]   I recognize her.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.760]   So none of these are photos.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.880]   These are all-- this is photo-realistic illustration
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.120]   that he's quite famous for.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.280]   I'm the detail in this.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.720]   There I am right there by the cab.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.800]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.160]   Let's zoom in on John C. Devorek.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.120]   That's as close as I can zoom.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.000]   Is that you right here?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.200]   Wow.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.160]   You know, it looks bigger in pictures.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.520]   That's actually just big.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:16.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.160]   That's Sal Segoian right there and his wife Naomi.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.120]   Look at that.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.000]   So this is pretty cool.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.760]   That is called Times Square.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.000]   And it is in San Francisco right now for just a couple weeks.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.760]   But it's touring.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.080]   It's going to be New York, Chicago, Los Angeles as well.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.720]   B-E-R-T-M-O-N-R-O-Y.com.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.600]   All right, let's talk a little bit about the tech news.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.280]   I guess we really-- I don't want to.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.560]   I don't even want to mention it.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.360]   But I guess we can't start the day
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.400]   without talking about really the biggest news story of the week,
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.320]   which is the horror in Norway.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.120]   That's tech news?
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.600]   It isn't.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.840]   But I think if I don't mention it,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.080]   it feels like we're not paying attention to it.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.680]   And it is tech news in a way because the guy--
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.000]   this horrendous guy who did this--
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.800]   wanted to go back to a more primitive society in which--
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.560]   and he mentioned piracy as being one of the software
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.440]   piracy, as being one of the banes of modern existence.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.480]   And the guy's in nut.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.760]   What's interesting-- what was interesting to me
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.760]   is I found out about it first, not on Twitter,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.640]   but on Google+.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.040]   And I think that that's one thing that has changed quite a bit.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.200]   Is that for you the first place you go now to Kevin?
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.440]   You know, I'm checking it definitely two, three times a day.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:27.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.200]   When it first-- I live on it.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.240]   It's very sticky.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.200]   It is.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   Because you have a real conversation with the audience.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.760]   You know, the people are going back and forth.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.880]   And you can actually like people's posts.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.760]   It feels like a real community versus when you're on Twitter,
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.080]   you're just getting these out replies.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.560]   And it's a lot of work to reply back to someone.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.800]   And then you miss some of them.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.040]   And it's just not sticky as much as Google+ is.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.240]   And I'm going to reshare.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.720]   So this is how easy it is to in effect retweet your tweet--
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.560]   or what do you call it?
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.060]   Plus.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.720]   Plus.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.040]   Your plus.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.160]   And so I just reshared that.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.080]   And you'll see the amount of engagement you get.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.800]   I mean, you shared this a few minutes ago.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.760]   261 plus is.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.280]   29 reshures, 169 comments.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.600]   You've replaced this--
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.520]   your blog with this.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.360]   This has become your blog.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.760]   Well, I mean, it has all the social features
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.160]   that I want in a blog.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.120]   But I can't really find in blog software.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.400]   Right.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.120]   It's like, if I post something on my blog and it goes live,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.880]   yes, it's going to hit all the RSS readers.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.800]   Some people will come in and comment that once they get it
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.880]   on the RSS, but it's not really real time.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.400]   I'm going to have to go out and promote it.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.480]   I'm going to have to tweet it.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.960]   You don't have to promote it here, do you?
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.480]   It just happens.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:32.960]   It just happens.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.560]   People start commenting on it right away.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.720]   And it's awesome.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.080]   And then I can go back to them right away
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.240]   and answer their questions.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.840]   I don't have to sit around and wait
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.200]   and check at the end of the day.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.560]   I can start having that conversation.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.400]   Do you worry, though, the problem with this, of course,
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.640]   is that this isn't your site.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   This is Google's site.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.480]   I mean, see, that's the problem.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.800]   Because there's a lot of people out there that--
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.200]   they monetize their blogs, right?
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.360]   They have ads on them.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.000]   I haven't done that in a while.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.920]   And so for me, it makes sense.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.520]   But a lot of people out there are going
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.000]   to want to keep their existing blogs,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.960]   because that's how they make their living.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.200]   There is a bigger issue, though.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.800]   And in fact, it surfaced this week.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.640]   Google started deleting accounts.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.960]   Well, it's not just Google Plus.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.680]   There's kind of two stories here that
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.160]   have been bounced around this week.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.680]   One is at Google Plus, basically they're like,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.240]   no commercial accounts, goodbye.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.480]   They killed Mashable.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.360]   Of course, Pete Cashmore's brilliant.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.880]   They said that from the beginning, though.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.960]   I understand that.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.800]   I'm with you.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.080]   I am totally good.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.720]   Google said no commercial accounts.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.320]   Fine.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   And then Pete Mashable went, that's not Mashable's account.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   That's my account.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.440]   And it kind of has a little--
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.120]   I like I've met him once.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.160]   He seems like a nice guy.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.280]   But no, it's Google went, oh, OK, we can take care of Pete.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:38.640]   And that's--
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.840]   See, that's a problem.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   But it's not a problem with that.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.400]   It's a problem.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.000]   How do you enforce this?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.520]   No brands.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.440]   What is a brand?
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.600]   Is Kevin Rose a brand?
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.400]   Not just no brands, but no certain.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.440]   Is Leo Laporta brand?
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.040]   It's a brand in a way.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.360]   What about people's--
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.040]   You're also a person.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.400]   Right.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.960]   I mean, that's what Google's saying,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.400]   is it has to have a first name and a last name.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.000]   But Pete Cashmore is Mashable.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.160]   Boing Boing did that.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.680]   They had an intern post-boing, boing, posts.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.120]   I think it becomes very difficult.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.560]   And I think when Google is deleting accounts like this,
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.040]   it's very risky.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.600]   It didn't delete my account or your account,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.480]   but they deleted some pretty important accounts.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.840]   But I think that they're planning a business
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.800]   solution here, right?
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.120]   They plan to have--
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.960]   They do.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.320]   I think they're going to be in touch to account.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.240]   I did what I think Ford and Mashable and all
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.960]   these other companies should have done, which is I created
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   a Twit profile.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.800]   And I applied for the business account.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.040]   And I said, I'm not going to post anything on this Twit
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.720]   profile until you say, yes, business accounts are launched.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.320]   They've also said, if you create a business account,
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.960]   a Ford account, we will not migrate that data over
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.160]   to a real business account.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.280]   So you're running the risk of losing all the engagement
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.800]   you had up to this point.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.280]   And yet there's so much value for a company like Mashable.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.320]   I mean, look what Mashable's gotten out of this.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.600]   Or somebody like an individual like Trey Radcliffe,
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.200]   he's put himself on the map with Google+.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.880]   We all knew who Trey Radcliffe was.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.400]   But boy, when he started posting on Google+,
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.600]   Or Tom from MySpace.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.440]   Tom from MySpace?
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.200]   That was amazing.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.120]   It's reactivated.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.880]   Tom Anderson is suddenly a good guy.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.880]   He's awesome.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.720]   He's been always been a good guy.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.880]   But nobody knew it until he started posting on Google+.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.600]   And it's still a closed system, though, right?
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.080]   Now, I'm seeing people tweeting, asking for invitations in.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.960]   So it's not so hard to get an invitation.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.520]   Are you guys are all in it, right?
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.440]   I think they're trying to-- I think they're trying to--
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.840]   not that Google really has problems with Google.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.440]   In the same way that Gmail was originally sort of like 18
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.280]   million people now.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.560]   Yeah, they're scaling fast.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.720]   But I think they're trying to keep a giant mess of suddenly
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.400]   half of New York City decides to sign on at once.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.320]   They're trying to trickle out invitations.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.560]   I think it's also been interesting,
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.800]   is coming up again this week is some people
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.920]   who've had their regular Google accounts have been suspended.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.000]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.520]   And they've lost.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.080]   So if you didn't know about it, the data liberation.org
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.480]   is a bunch of Google engineers.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.520]   They're actually working to help you get your information
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.760]   out of Google so you can store it offline.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.720]   Should, for some reason, your account disappear.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.840]   And you suddenly find out all of your contacts, your calendar.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.240]   They call it your Google takeout.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.960]   You can get everything out of Google.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.360]   That's one thing Google's done right.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.800]   Well, I've been trying to do this with bailiff.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.640]   They cancel your account.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.920]   And you leave your Gmail.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.880]   I finally got to work.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.600]   I exported all of my friends from Facebook.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.360]   I used the Chrome extension.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:19.760]   What did you say?
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.960]   I was like a bird's house with a baseball bat.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.600]   I actually didn't care about it.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.120]   Well, I just wanted to find all my friends in G Plus.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.400]   Because you don't necessarily have all these conversations.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.240]   I mean, it's using Google to look at who I've communicated
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.000]   with in the past.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.520]   And then it suggests friends to you.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.240]   And that's great.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.120]   And I found a bunch of people.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.600]   But I was still missing some people, right?
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.080]   You know what I did is there was a workaround
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.960]   where you would import it to Yahoo.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.720]   And then you'd import from Yahoo.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.600]   I don't know if they closed that workaround down.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.760]   That's not the one you used to.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.240]   I just don't know.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   Don't they allow you to download your data?
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.920]   I think Facebook--
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.640]   In a zip file.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.160]   --really dumb.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.560]   Right.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.000]   But it's an XML file.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.360]   We need to tool to parse that, though,
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.880]   and then re-import that back into--
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.840]   Well, there was a company that was working to build tools.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.800]   I'm using other things.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.080]   You can do this back.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.560]   Come on.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.680]   Mobile to programs.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.040]   I don't know.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.080]   I think Google really is walking a fine line here.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.200]   I admire the idea is that you have to be a person.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.000]   But there are lots of people.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   What's his name?
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.960]   Zud or whatever?
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.200]   This is a handle this guy's always used.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.280]   And how is a handle not as good as a real name?
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.560]   I mean, if that's what you use, shouldn't you
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.960]   be allowed to use your handle?
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.560]   How does print supply for an account?
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.060]   Right.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.000]   It's got a weird symbol.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Right.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.480]   But that's a real--
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.400]   It's a problem easy if it was if there
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.000]   were a bright, clear line and you could say, oh, that's a person.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.640]   That's not a person.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.080]   But it isn't that easy.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.120]   And when you see Mashable turn into Pete Cashmore,
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.440]   but have exactly the same stuff--
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.560]   Yeah, I mean, I don't mind--
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.720]   it's Google's playground.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.480]   It's Google's rules.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.160]   Well, they get to do what they want to understand.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.200]   I just want them to apply those rules equally across everyone.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.880]   That's all.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.040]   And it's difficult to do.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.680]   I think we should be realistic about this
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.720]   and just call it or cut two and expect it to disappear.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.080]   Really?
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.000]   Now, you're on here, but you don't post on here.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.120]   I've got to post up there.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.320]   A post.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:04.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.880]   I've got to find it.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.640]   You've only posted once?
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.320]   So it doesn't grab you.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.200]   Post on Twitter and I've got my own damn blog
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.320]   and I talk on here.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.680]   I want to say hi to everyone following me
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.960]   and those who will be eventually.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.640]   I'll be posting some interesting off-topic insight here,
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.040]   both here and on Twitter, July 12.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.200]   There's also to work.org/blog and knowagendochow.com.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.880]   Hey.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.400]   Hey.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.120]   I like the picture.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.640]   Is that you?
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.040]   Is that a Rothko?
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.600]   What is that?
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.440]   Is that you?
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.920]   Say, yeah, that is actually the Pacific Northwest,
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.400]   taken from a cart, 80 miles an hour out the window
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.960]   with a slow shutter speed.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.640]   Well, one thing that happens is it's just one more thing
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.560]   that we have to--
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.040]   like if we wanted to be connected,
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.280]   it's one more thing to do.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.280]   How connected do we have to do?
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.520]   You're going to still be tweeting on Twitter, right?
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.640]   And I'm not going to do all this.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.200]   And what really bugs me the most--
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.040]   I might as well say it.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.520]   I've said it before.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.440]   I'll say it again.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.240]   People, they post in one place and then they massively--
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.760]   everything duplicates all over the place.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.640]   So I'm following somebody here.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.520]   I don't want to follow somebody on Foriscare.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.800]   I don't give a crap if somebody's eating lunch in Des Moines,
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.680]   Iowa at the McDonald's.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.760]   I forgot to check in.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.040]   I got to check in.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.160]   I'm trying to become the mayor.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.800]   And so then I see this on Twitter.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   I don't care.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.440]   I don't care that they're eating lunch in Des Moines.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.800]   It's like, I've got nothing to do with me.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.640]   I'm not going to go japan to play in a good Des Moines.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.200]   Well, I think that that's what's happening.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.400]   I think Twitter's becoming kind of this background noise
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.280]   with a lot of updates in it.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.480]   A variety of stuff, not really almost intended
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.280]   for human consumption, but just kind of a stream of information.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.320]   And then if you want to have a human conversation,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.000]   you use Google+, but you can use tools to parse Twitter
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.440]   to find-- like Flipboard, which is a great example.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.000]   Flipboard finds all the links, turns it into a magazine.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.240]   All the content is there.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.120]   I don't know.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.480]   I'm a big fan of Google+, I think there's a lot of--
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.840]   Do you think it's too geeky though?
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.920]   That was one of the--
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.000]   That's why I like it.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.800]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   But I don't want--
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.320]   I'm drinking that break in the mainstream.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.640]   I hope it doesn't.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.040]   I know you hope it doesn't, but Google hopes it does.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.560]   Well, that's a--
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.440]   I'll give you an example.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.520]   Or a cut too.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.600]   A chill went down my spine this week.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.680]   Justin Bieber posted a picture on Instagram.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.160]   Yeah, I know.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.080]   As long as the children go up your leg.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.480]   No, that was a warm stream that went down my leg.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.160]   No, Justin Bieber posted a picture of LA traffic on Instagram.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.800]   One picture said, boy, the traffic is bad.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.280]   I don't know.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.320]   Have you talked to Kevin's sister?
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.960]   But I imagine their servers got pam.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.760]   A lot of people joined.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.880]   Yeah, a lot of people signed up.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   A lot of teeny bopers said, I can see Justin Bieber's pictures
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.160]   on here.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   I'm going to be here.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.760]   And that ruins the ecosystem, doesn't it?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.280]   Doesn't it?
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.560]   Because you're not following Justin Bieber unless you are.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.360]   But wait, making sure--
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.960]   No, you're not going to see any of his posts anywhere.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.960]   What's going to ruin that?
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.760]   That's on that one.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.240]   Instagram now has enough users to become a sustainable
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:51.760]   business.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.920]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.280]   Twitter has enough users to become a sustainable business.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.080]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.880]   And Leo, you have how many followers on Twitter?
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.040]   I don't know, 280,000.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.200]   And you tweet how often?
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.200]   But to look at Kevin's, you've got more than 2 million,
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.840]   probably, right?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   OK, so 1.2 million.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.640]   So if you switch to Google+, you disconnect.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.360]   You know what's weird is that I have more followers on Google
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:11.920]   Plus in just three weeks.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.120]   That's just one of the weeks.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.480]   No kidding.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.960]   And I had two years on Twitter.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.800]   And I'm sure for both of us, it will exceed Twitter pretty
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.920]   quickly.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:26.120]   Look at Tiffany Renee, just Google+ to picture from the
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.040]   studio.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.640]   I like that.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.280]   That's the instantaneous nature of it.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.360]   Well, did you see the nearby feature on the phone?
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.080]   So when we were driving over here--
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.120]   my girlfriend, Daria, is here somewhere--
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.960]   she pulled out her phone and she launched Google Plus.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.880]   And then she said, show me public posts nearby.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.320]   I love that.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.000]   And then she saw everyone talking about quit, right around
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.160]   here.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.240]   Even though she's not following any of those people, it
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:49.840]   was really cool.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.760]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.680]   But how valuable is it to your day-to-day living?
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.400]   It's kind of cool when there's a big event.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.480]   You want to see photos around those events.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.000]   Right.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.440]   It could be super useful.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.720]   Yeah, for stalkers.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.240]   Oh, I think it's a great thing as you come up to--
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.360]   let's say you're at a concert and you can see all the
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.120]   posts from the concert, all the pictures.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.280]   That's what color was trying to do.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.720]   This has that kind of feature built into it, doesn't it?
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.240]   I think that's a nice feature.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.640]   I just pissed that mine crashes on the iPhone all the time.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.280]   I can't get Google+ to work.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.080]   Why are you still using the iPhone?
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.240]   I really like Android.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.400]   I have to say, the more I use it--
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   Are you completely sold?
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.080]   Like you're all in?
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.280]   I'm sold all in on the Android.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:27.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.200]   You change phones like--
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.360]   No, no, I'm all in.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   I've been all in for some time.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.280]   Based on when you see--
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.240]   How does the S's last arrive?
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.000]   I'm not using the good end, the good--
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.480]   This is a good end, right?
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.080]   What's wrong with it?
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:37.600]   Android.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.520]   Oh, you have the Nexus S2?
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.120]   Nexus 2S?
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.120]   No, that's Nexus S.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.680]   I don't want it to be.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.960]   You want the next one.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.520]   That's out of date.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.800]   Eileen, this is the good one.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.360]   Geek fight.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.120]   There's a new one?
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.080]   There's the sequel to that.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.880]   It's better than that.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.920]   Oh, yeah?
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.960]   What's better about it?
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.840]   I think there's our show all about Android.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.920]   Now, she's got it in a white case.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.000]   But for one thing, it's a bigger--
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.360]   Ooh.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:57.760]   Bigger.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.360]   Yeah, ooh.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.080]   That just happened.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.240]   And it's thin.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.200]   That just--
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.720]   This is not that bad for 10 minutes.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.000]   That's the successor.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.480]   And I think in every respect, it's a better--
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.120]   The power of the battery life on that, Eileen.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.120]   The power of the Android phone is like--
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:08.560]   Good for an hour.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.000]   How's the battery life on that, Eileen?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.600]   But that's great.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.160]   I've got to invest the better one.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.080]   I've got great screens.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.040]   I mean, so here's incoming, let's see, nearby.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.640]   So it thinks I'm in Berkeley.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.280]   That's kind of a problem.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.400]   Change the return key to the other side.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.360]   What are they changing the--
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.160]   Just ridiculous, these guys.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.480]   It confuses me.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   There's no confusion.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.120]   It's like, Eileen.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:29.800]   No, you're right.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.640]   There's no standard for the buttons on the bottom.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.120]   When you're at night, you can't see the thing
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.680]   because it turns off so you just know where to hit.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.200]   You somebody hand you this phone.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.640]   You're going to be hitting the wrong thing.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.880]   Look at this Google+ stream.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.240]   So this is what's going on in my stream.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:41.760]   I'm seeing--
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.240]   It's not very funny.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.640]   So I saw somebody in the studio.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.000]   Now I'm seeing Kenny who's watching it live at home.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.480]   So this is his house.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.560]   I'm seeing Colin who's saying, here's my desk.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.080]   I'm seeing-- there's Tiffany Renee.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.240]   She's on our city council.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.880]   She's in the background there.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   It's like four square without the food references
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.680]   in the obscure notes.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.160]   I just think it's-- I think it's better than--
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:02.520]   So I like--
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.080]   Thank you, Todd.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.680]   I think it's better than Facebook or--
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.440]   I like this little cube thing they're doing here.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.280]   So you turn-- you got this going on.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.880]   She just-- that's just some logic.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.320]   Oh, is it?
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.440]   Because I think this should be on Linux systems.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.880]   I think Linux needs an eye.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.400]   That's just the logic.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.440]   That's just the logic.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.480]   I-- where did I lose control?
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.800]   Tell me, Linux needs a GUI like this.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.400]   We've been in the studio for five minutes.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.240]   I've already lost control.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.640]   So Leo, I think you should move your blog over to Google+.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.200]   You think so?
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.200]   I would certainly get more in the kitchen.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   Don't do it whenever you don't listen to me.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.680]   Do it live.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.200]   Do it now.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.520]   He's trying to ruin it right now.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.680]   Dare to be dull.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.360]   We're all doing it.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.960]   We're all doing it, Leo.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.680]   Come on.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.480]   How about a take a break?
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.920]   How about if we do a commercial and come back?
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.480]   We've got a great panel of people.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.320]   I'm just really thrilled to have my dearest friends
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.600]   in studio to launch the new brick house.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.120]   So is you ready to go to commercial?
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   Where's the kitchen and--
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.000]   It's in the back.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.960]   You've got to see the kitchen.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.620]   I'll wander around, John.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.620]   Be back in 10 minutes.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.400]   I'll do it with the ham radios.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.020]   The ham radios aren't-- actually, they are here.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.520]   They're in the--
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.020]   You heard about this?
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.520]   I have the anti-talkies.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.620]   Technician's license for sure.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.720]   Yeah, and he has a license.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.360]   He's a hand to--
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.860]   I had a first shot.
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.900]   It's not that hard.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.300]   Don't ask about the general license.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.220]   Technician, anyway, I can get it.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.700]   It's actually pretty easy.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.740]   But I studied for it.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.920]   I studied for about a week.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.900]   Didn't you?
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.940]   No, I just took it.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.820]   Really?
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.660]   I knew all that stuff.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.740]   Do you know all that stuff?
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.820]   Did you get it in the Morse code days?
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.380]   Or did you get it with Morse code?
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.180]   With Morse code.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.860]   You don't have to do Morse code.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.620]   But I am learning Morse code because it's actually--
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.980]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.980]   It's a very useful thing.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.660]   So if you're ever trapped in a Turkish prison,
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.020]   you could tap on the pipe.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.420]   Yeah, and then no one will know what you're talking about.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.860]   I don't have my license.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.500]   Could you say that in English?
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.340]   The way I'm learning, though, it's kind of interesting.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.980]   You can learn dots and dashes, learn it by sound
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.060]   like it's a language.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.580]   So you don't hear dots and dashes.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.860]   You hear the music of it.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.180]   And that's how you get to high speed 20 words a minute.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.180]   Tip for you.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.380]   Just a little tip.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.340]   I knew I'd get something out of showing up.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.340]   My best friends are here.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.660]   John C. Devorak, Patrick Norton, Kevin Rose, Steve Gibson.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.060]   I can't think of a better way to inaugurate in this studio.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.500]   Pre-champagne.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.540]   And champagne.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.040]   Yes.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.900]   It's OK.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.420]   And also our best sponsors, as always on the show,
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.060]   including our friends at Citrix, they do
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.740]   Go to Assist Express, which is a great tool.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.060]   Do you remember on the screen savers
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.940]   we used Expert City for a while?
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.700]   That was what was the kernel of what
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.980]   became Go to Assist Express.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.420]   And then, of course, Citrix added their amazing remote access
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:17.940]   capability.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.380]   And you've got a tool that is just so good.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.500]   128 at SSL at all times.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.660]   I don't have tally lights.
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.460]   I don't even know where my-- that's my camera.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.180]   That's my camera.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:29.900]   That's the single.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.420]   And that's the thing that goes whoopee, whoopee, whoopee.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.420]   Whoopee, whoopee.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.180]   That's the technical term.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.180]   It's the technical term.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.980]   The camera 33 is the whoopee, whoopee, whoopee, cam.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.420]   They allow you to do eight sessions at once.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.940]   Unattended support.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.580]   You could find out what operating system's running.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.860]   Because it works Mac or PC, but also with security software.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.820]   We're at version.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.500]   Right down to the point updates.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.020]   It is just a fantastic product.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.700]   I want you to try it free right now.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.300]   It's easy if you go to go to assist.com/twit.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.260]   And I know sometimes when I say go to go to assist,
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.500]   it confuses the hell out of people.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.620]   So I'll say visit go to assist.com,
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.940]   g-o-t-o-assist.com/twit.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.700]   And you could try it free for 30 days.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.620]   Remote access.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.220]   It's never been easy until now.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.460]   And remote support.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.420]   That's always been tough until now.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.420]   Go to assist express.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.060]   It makes it easy.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.940]   It makes it fast.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.340]   It makes you a support hero.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.300]   Go to assist.com/leo.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.340]   John, you didn't take a walk.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.660]   Where's the webcam?
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.140]   Which-- where's the webcam?
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.820]   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out from what I've seen.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.700]   I think it's over here.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.340]   Oh, the spy cam?
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.260]   Right here.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.740]   There it is.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:34.500]   I don't know where it is.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.180]   You mean the drop cam?
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.900]   And by the bit.ly, yeah, the bit.ly drop cam.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.660]   It's somewhere over in the far corner over there.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.660]   OK.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.820]   It's by the ham station.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.540]   That's what the ham station is going to be over in the corner.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.500]   You know what John we're getting as an AM radio Collins
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.060]   transmitter and console?
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.140]   A Collins?
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.140]   Wow.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.260]   It's going to be so cool over there.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.260]   Thanks to PopLile.
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.260]   Why are you guys doing this?
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.740]   Why are you guys doing this?
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.300]   I could open a BBS up next.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.060]   That would be awesome.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.860]   You should seriously get a 2400-bot modem
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.580]   and set up your own BBS in the corner.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.900]   Why not?
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.220]   We need a bunch of lines, though.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:07.740]   You need more.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.540]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.340]   You got eight lines.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   Eight line BBS.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.740]   That's actually a great idea.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.940]   That would be amazing.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.980]   That's actually a great idea.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.300]   You could make-- maybe milk should make like a little mobile
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.460]   but BBS app.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.460]   No, we're not making this.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.900]   It would be like a little screen scrolling up.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.540]   A little screen that scrolls up a threaded box.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.100]   If you've pointed the show, you get enough champagne
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.540]   and the chemicals and the tarpes with the project is.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.980]   The blinking square cursor.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.700]   This is amazing, Leo.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.620]   So OS 10 Lion.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.420]   I'm running it here.
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.420]   Are you running it?
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.020]   Of course.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.580]   What do you think?
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.700]   It took me a while to get used to scrolling.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.860]   It's so weird.
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.660]   It is weird.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.300]   Because on the iPad, when you want to scroll,
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.100]   you're just sliding paper up and down.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.740]   So it makes sense, right?
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.540]   Up means the paper goes up.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.860]   Down means the paper goes down.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.300]   But on a mouse, it's the exact opposite.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.020]   You scroll down and you're going down the screen
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.940]   and you scroll up and you're going up the screen.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.740]   So why do you think they're doing this?
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.220]   There's something to this.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.220]   On Google+, I said, great.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.540]   Steve Jobs spends 27 years teaching us
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.300]   that you scroll this way and then, ha ha,
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.700]   and switches it around on you.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.140]   That's how awesome he is.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.620]   It's like, I am so awesome that I could just make everybody
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.380]   do something different.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.820]   You can't turn it off.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.820]   I think there's actually a deeper lesson here, which is
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.660]   that Apple and Microsoft is doing this too, really kind
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.100]   of got swayed by the success of these tablets
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.780]   and these touch interfaces.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.460]   And they even want the desktop to kind of echo the touch
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:34.780]   interface.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.820]   Well, do you think they're going to eventually
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.420]   go touch screen on laptops?
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.220]   No.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.260]   But on the air, for instance, have you
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.220]   been using full screen on your browser?
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:42.940]   No.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.420]   So what I've been doing is full screen on my browser
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.700]   and then you do this four finger swipe.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.580]   And then four finger swipe over, let's say,
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.060]   I have full screen on my email.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.780]   So this is very-- this is-- think about it.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.580]   That's a tablet-like experience.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.420]   I'm swiping from the iPad.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.980]   But that's very tablet-like.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.980]   This is also about--
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.700]   Because we have that on my pad after you add the development
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.620]   tools.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.140]   Exactly.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.380]   And full screen--
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.340]   When you do full screen apps like that,
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.060]   that's also very tablet-oriented.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.460]   Now, it's a little weird on a 27-inch screen.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.740]   It'd be going like this.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.540]   But on this device--
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.380]   It's a minority.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:14.880]   It works great.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.540]   But it isn't minority.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.020]   This is about unifying the interface.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.460]   I agree.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.180]   All the platforms.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.260]   This is like NDE at CES was like, yeah, you know what?
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.180]   OK, there's no more market for 3D graphics
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.020]   for moving into ARM.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:24.860]   ARM is the future.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.460]   There were more ARM processors sold in the last year
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.100]   than in the previous five years of x86 or some--
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:30.940]   Isn't that great, isn't that great?
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.940]   --this stat like that.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.780]   And it's like unifying the interface
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.060]   across the phones, the computers, and eventually
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.860]   probably televisions in your minority report headset.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.740]   And so the idea is you develop once.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.140]   And with Apple, Apple's sitting there going like, yeah,
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.500]   we're going to release a new S. We're going to do it
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.540]   through our new stores.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.260]   You're going to have to buy this version of the operating
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.500]   system to get the store to download the new operating system.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.460]   And we're going to create this incredibly tightly controlled
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.940]   pool or channel or whatever you want to call it that controls
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.740]   access to applications and the applications running on the system.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.660]   Apple is trying to nail the operating system
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.660]   and the apps to the floor and control that experience.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.540]   I like it, though.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.740]   There's something I really like about that.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.340]   When it works.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.060]   So I just got the new Air.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:11.660]   This isn't it.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.140]   It's at home.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.300]   I'm still setting it up.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.620]   But I went to the App Store.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.380]   And I started downloading all the apps I have on this.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.180]   So easy.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.460]   And it just says, we realize you already purchased this.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.900]   And now we're just going to let you install it.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:21.860]   It was awesome.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:27.020]   It's awesome if you have a big, fat gigantic cable modem
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.020]   or better--
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.100]   Well, you can't even get it.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.780]   It's great if you're not like installing 25--
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:32.980]   It's a 3.2 gig download.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:33.480]   --systems.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:33.980]   You can't even--
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.060]   You can't even get mine without broadband.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.760]   The new Air didn't come with any type of backup anything.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.180]   Like it didn't come with a thumb drive.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:41.740]   Does it need to--
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.140]   --to the US?
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.060]   It does it over the internet.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.900]   Right.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.660]   Because I do like this idea.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.940]   But the negative about having all your apps in the App Store
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.060]   is Apple has to approve every app.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.060]   And they don't approve his apps with demo, free demo versions.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.620]   They don't approve open source apps.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.420]   They don't approve anything.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.540]   It's naughty because Steve doesn't like naughty stuff.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.420]   So suddenly, what happens-- and this
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.220]   was a big concern of mine is this becomes--
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.260]   this App Store becomes so attractive.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.560]   Because of things like I could just
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.960]   as reinstall all my apps--
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.080]   That you only buy.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.960]   I rebuy apps just for that convenience.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.520]   That's why.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:12.880]   It's retarded.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.840]   Stupid.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.400]   Stupid.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.600]   And yet, they've got you.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.200]   And now what I worry about is that the ecosystem is so changed
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.160]   that a lot of very important stuff like open source apps are gone.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.120]   You're not going to get hand break on the App Store.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.280]   So you can't submit hand break to the App Store?
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.240]   You could, but they won't approve it.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.520]   Well, they could.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.560]   They could, but they won't.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.040]   They know that.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.760]   Yet another reason to stay with the PC.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.760]   So--
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.000]   No, because guess what?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.500]   And the reason we're having this conversation--
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.600]   You're using a Mac right now.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.900]   That's where Windows is going.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.400]   No, but that's where Windows-- same thing.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.400]   If you look at Windows--
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.680]   I've got a business if they ever pull that stuff off.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.760]   You think so?
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.000]   What are they doing it for?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.080]   I mean, what's wrong with it--
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.480]   Did you look at Windows 8?
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.080]   Yeah, I did.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   It's a stink.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.960]   Oh, yeah, we had this conversation.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.760]   Well, that's what they're doing.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.560]   So they're out of business.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.680]   They think they're doing it.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.640]   It remains to be seen.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.360]   Will the users rebel?
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.280]   I think I would.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.920]   I'm going to.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.240]   And we all move--
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.560]   We're staying on XP, Leo.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.920]   You always go to Linux.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.000]   I think-- well, I think actually that maybe--
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.240]   you may be very glad there's Linux in a few years.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.320]   I'm glad there is now.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.360]   I think that if you want choice, if you want to be source--
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   I'll be supporting Windows 7 forever.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:20.760]   That's true.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.600]   We got 10 years.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   We do.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.840]   But then what?
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.960]   Maybe we quit.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.720]   Apple may be buying Hulu.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.960]   We found out with Apple's quarterly results
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.200]   that they have what is it?
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.400]   $72 billion in the bank.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.360]   They could buy Hulu.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.320]   They could buy NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, and Hulu.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.360]   God.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.960]   They could buy anything they want.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.000]   But they are supposedly making--
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.880]   They're building a spaceship.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.520]   They could.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.920]   All things D said, don't hold your breath on the Apple.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.720]   Hulu deal.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.040]   Actually, I think it's a bad idea for Apple to do that.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   The deal was, I think, that Hulu said, we guarantee if you buy us,
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.320]   we guarantee you a couple of three years of access to the content.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.760]   But after that, there's no guarantee.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.000]   And if it's Apple that owns the content,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.280]   do you think CBS and Fox and all the NBC, the content providers,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.400]   still maintain that agreement?
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.200]   What are you buying if you're buying Hulu?
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   In a contract for three years that runs out in three years,
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.600]   you're not buying anything of great value, if you ask me.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.880]   So I don't know if this makes sense.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.240]   You're buying a chance to undermine the greater revenue
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.520]   as you get off of iTunes.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.560]   So are you buying it defensively?
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.160]   I'm buying it to close it.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.040]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.960]   Put it out of business?
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.120]   Why not?
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.960]   Apple has $76.2 billion in cash on the books.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   Do they buy it to compete with Netflix?
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.000]   Since it seems to be like Netflix versus iTunes versus,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.480]   I don't know, who Google in terms of trying to get content.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.640]   But if you think about it, with $72 billion,
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.480]   they could buy Netflix Walt Disney News Corp.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.800]   They could just buy it all.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.200]   OK.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.200]   Why not?
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.600]   Hulu's price tag $2 billion.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.320]   That's like one news interest.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.800]   Check and feed.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.280]   Apple doesn't usually buy things.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.400]   In fact, the biggest company Apple ever bought was Next 400 million.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.520]   They're not known for buying big companies.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.840]   Although that was a good deal.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.480]   They got Steve Jobs in that as the player to be named later.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.600]   Hulu Plus is $7.99 a month.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.160]   Netflix is $7.99 a month.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.080]   And iTunes, you buy a film at a time.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.800]   It's all a cart.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.840]   Which is the better model.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.360]   We really don't want Apple to become infinitely powerful, though,
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.280]   because a lot of things that Steve Jobs does is really annoying.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.480]   I mean, we're forced to do it his way.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.840]   And sometimes that's not what I want.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.960]   Somebody wrote this brilliant column,
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.760]   except they sort of forgot the point.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.600]   They're like, Apple can't do a television,
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.240]   because televisions have to be supported for like seven years.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.720]   They're like, it's Steve.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.160]   He makes you walk away from a $3,000 computer in three years.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.520]   Certainly he'll walk away from a $2,000 television in three years.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.480]   I believe there's any legislation that says
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.760]   it has to be supported for seven years.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.240]   And it gets for the automobile industry.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.120]   It's just the ex- notification.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.520]   People usually, the tradition, right?
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.320]   The HCTV has been so amazing for the consumer electronics industry.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.080]   Because before HCTV's came along,
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.920]   average life expectancy of a television was 11 years.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.080]   Typical television was in a living room or in a room
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.840]   or in a bedroom for 11 years.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:49.880]   The S-E-Tell
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.840]   Turn up Patrick's mic.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.680]   Are we watching the levels?
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.480]   Because I am actually hearing some complaints about audio in general.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.120]   Like I'm clipping.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.720]   It's just the stream folks.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.760]   Just the stream folks?
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.320]   Should I use my Leo Laport voice?
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:02.840]   Yes!
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:03.920]   If you talk like that.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.960]   Screaming at the mic.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   We'll all be happy.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.120]   Also says Leo's too loud, but I told everyone that this is coming.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.040]   Yeah, we're working on it.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.720]   Apparently I'm clipping a little bit on the stream.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.200]   Things like that.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:12.760]   We're working on it.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.640]   These are little, you know.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.600]   You got a limiter on him, crank to the max.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.760]   You think that we would have done one show out of here just like a dry old show.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.720]   A dry run?
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.040]   Dry run.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.080]   Why bother?
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.160]   Everyone wants to experience the maiden voice.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.080]   Yeah, this is the big bother.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.280]   This is an open network.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.960]   Everybody gets to share the joy.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.560]   I'm the kind of test pilot.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.720]   You want to fly the first flight of the plane?
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.920]   OK!
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.200]   Let's just all go.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.320]   What could go wrong?
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:37.800]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:42.680]   If I can have the iPad with the quad-res screen, I'll be happy for a long time.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.440]   That's the rumor that maybe this fall?
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.200]   Now Kevin, you got all the...
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.040]   It's looking like it's really going to happen.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.480]   And oh my goodness.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.160]   To have the pixel resolution of the iPhone 4.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.960]   That would be amazing.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.320]   I've written the display on the iPad.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.280]   Because the iPad...
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.880]   I can see the pixels on the iPad.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.840]   It's annoying.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.400]   And to have it cranked up to that quad-res...
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.120]   Oh!
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.200]   So do you guys use your iPad on a daily basis?
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:04.600]   I do.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:04.920]   You do.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.960]   My constant companion.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.520]   You don't anymore.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.560]   It's absolutely...
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.360]   It's absolutely a vares.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.160]   This is replaced.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:09.560]   It hasn't it?
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:09.800]   Right.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.920]   Totally.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.400]   I use it.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.760]   Actually, when I'm writing, I need a keyboard for anything else.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.720]   Oh absolutely.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.560]   It's output only.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   But for reading the news and...
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.160]   News is awesome.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.640]   Check an email and just surf in the web.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.040]   So you know when it's time to get rid of that old iPad?
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.960]   Get the new iPad?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.240]   I have five of them.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.680]   I think you need to know about a site...
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.560]   What do you have five?
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.040]   Exactly.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.480]   Two of the old ones and three of the new ones.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:33.880]   Why?
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.360]   Because Zell Dye Como.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.880]   Why do they have three of anything?
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.440]   It's a ride off.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.320]   So they can each be in their own room.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.840]   I don't have to carry it from room to room.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.800]   This guy...
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.400]   You don't understand.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.240]   This guy still has...
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.600]   Palm...
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.000]   What is it?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.960]   The Palm Tungsten?
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.720]   Yeah, the T3.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.120]   He...
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.640]   He still has a T3.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:49.960]   Why?
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.920]   How many in his fridge?
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.480]   Like eight.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.520]   In the fridge.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.040]   So that they don't go bad.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.040]   But I think you've changed your tuna.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.000]   Yeah, I won't go back.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.840]   But you put it in the freezer or just the regular...
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.120]   No, no, you don't want to freeze the lifting my own cells.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:02.920]   Or the LCD.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.600]   You just want to refrigerate them.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.960]   So you keep it in a bag?
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.080]   They go about the moisture.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.120]   The moisture is kind of like...
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:08.760]   You seal them.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.480]   You know if they're all...
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.760]   They're all hermatically sealed.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.560]   Everyone had that...
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.200]   Did you suck the air out?
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.240]   Did you do a vacuum?
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.720]   You bring them out of three and a half volts.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.000]   Three and a half volts is awful.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:17.640]   I keep my vacuum.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.280]   What am I thinking?
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.080]   Friggin' night or...
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:19.560]   No.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:19.960]   No.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.600]   Is it really nice?
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.000]   The reason he does this is when you fall in love with the technology
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.760]   and you know it's going to be ultimately discontinued,
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.040]   you buy a bunch of them.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.640]   I did that with...
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.240]   Remember the HP...
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.600]   How many of those T-shirts do you own?
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.160]   Come on, tell us.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.120]   The HP 11C calculator is the best calculator ever made.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.520]   And you can't get them anymore except on eBay.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.800]   And I've got like 12 of them.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.560]   Or equalized cells in Palo Alto.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.440]   A button might go bad.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.480]   So...
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.920]   You have to.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.520]   They have calculators on the computer now.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.120]   Exactly.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:46.680]   Exactly.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.960]   Only two of the...
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.760]   The...
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.240]   I don't have to know.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.320]   In fact, you could probably get an HP 12C on the...
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:51.800]   There is one.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.360]   I have one.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.000]   It's not the same.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.280]   No, you have three.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.960]   Oh no, 15C I think.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.560]   So about that tactile response.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.520]   But seriously, on the iPad is...
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.280]   I mean, does that replace the ones in the fridge?
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.160]   Oh yeah, I'm not going to go back to the...
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.000]   Okay, so this is why I want to tell you about Paul.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:07.560]   What is the fridge?
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.600]   When you take them out of the fridge?
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.560]   Like this is why...
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   This is why...
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.800]   If you have a refrigerator full of tons...
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.840]   Yeah, because otherwise they would get condensation on them.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.800]   And then I would be bad.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.160]   Okay, look, go to gazelle.com.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:19.880]   What is it?
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.120]   What is the name of the HP 12?
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.160]   That...
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:23.400]   What?
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:23.880]   Which?
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.920]   Which one do you want to sell?
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.600]   The 11C is the...
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.720]   11C or...
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.840]   Gazelle.com.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.680]   I don't want to sell...
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.400]   HP 11C...
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.400]   No, no, let's see how much you can get for that structure.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.200]   Just an example.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:34.680]   Just an example.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.640]   Just an example.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.760]   No, not on gazelle.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.880]   This is a sponsor.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.360]   Don't make a...
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:38.920]   Okay.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.400]   Now, Steve, I have some questions to ask you.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.680]   You can pull up my screen here.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.960]   My calculator has functional or physical problems that prevent use?
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.440]   No.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:46.600]   No.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.480]   Normal wear and tear?
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.440]   No, it's never been used.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.680]   No noticeable flaws, I think.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.000]   Right.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.680]   Okay, look at this.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.120]   Do you have all the original stuff?
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.720]   I bought one for the start of the car.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   It's gone way up to worth 30 bucks.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.400]   $44, Steve.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.680]   $44, wow.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.240]   $44.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:01.800]   I'll give you...
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.440]   I'm keeping it.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.480]   I can't raise the...
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.600]   Wait a minute, I can't raise the...
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:06.920]   How much...
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.960]   Well, how much were they new?
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.880]   I don't remember now.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.680]   I got them from eBay.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.000]   So, Jukicak, eBay.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.040]   I...
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.040]   This is guaranteed or this is more than the...
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.240]   that you get on eBay.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.440]   And by the way, if you use the offer code TWIP,
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.640]   they're going to add 5%.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.680]   So, let's add 5%.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.960]   This is some promotion we're doing here.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.440]   This is the...
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.160]   Hey, Shawn!
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:25.720]   Yeah!
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.440]   I could be in the...
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.400]   I could be in the kitchen.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.280]   Go to the kitchen.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:28.840]   Go water.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.800]   There's a...
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.560]   There's a Zingerman's food basket.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.440]   Dr. Mom said it said Zingerman's food basket in the kitchen.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.480]   Anything you want, John.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.160]   What point is the direction of where the kitchen is?
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.720]   It's on the other side of the watery column of death.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   There goes John.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.760]   See the voreclays, gentlemen.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.160]   Hey, John.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.680]   Can you give me a diet Coke while you're in there?
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.440]   A diet Coke for Mr. Norton.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.000]   Thanks, John.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.440]   Wow!
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:53.400]   Next.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.440]   So anyway, gazelle.com.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.320]   Sell your crap.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.640]   Don't sell your crap.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.680]   Sell your crap?
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.560]   Don't sell your crap.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.440]   Is that your official slogan?
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.560]   No, no, it is.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.920]   I just made that up.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.200]   Slogan is don't sell it.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.080]   Gazelle it.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.320]   What you do is you go here, you get the offers,
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.560]   you get a box, they pay the shipping,
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.720]   they give you cash, they're data experts,
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.120]   remove all the data so you don't have to worry about that.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.360]   If it's not recyclable, if I had like,
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.280]   if it's not saleable, if I had written like that,
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.560]   you couldn't start the thing,
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.560]   they recycle it in a responsible way.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.600]   No landfill, no offshoring, they take care of everything.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.160]   Do they pick up?
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.920]   Yeah, give you a box.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.520]   You put in a box, your mail box.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.240]   A uniform member of the federal government will come and get it.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.760]   AKA your mailman.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.720]   I don't like that part.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.600]   And they pay the postage and everything.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.640]   Anyway, it's a great way.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   If you're ready to get a new phone, a new iPad,
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.920]   whatever you're looking for,
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.280]   don't sell it, g-a-z-e-l-l-e.com.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.080]   Yes, they'll even buy your 11C for 44 bucks,
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.280]   which I got to tell you, Steve, is a very fair deal.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.800]   I'm going to live a long time, Leo.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.480]   It's a very fair deal.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.680]   Hey, let's check in with the newsroom.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.800]   I've always wanted to say that.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.120]   Tom Merritt is in the TNT newsroom.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.600]   And in fact, so is I as in Sarah.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.200]   What's up for the week ahead?
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:08.840]   I don't know this video.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.240]   Yeah, we're getting comfortable in the new digs here.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.600]   This is not going to be our own.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.160]   (laughter)
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.360]   We had the drinking a little.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.080]   Sorry about that.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:23.320]   But we are still taking a look at the stories
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.160]   coming up in the week ahead today.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   A bunch of phones, actually, AT&T's Nexus S,
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.800]   now available at Best Buy for $100 on contract.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.640]   And the Motorola Titanium arrives on Sprint today for $149.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.680]   The Aftermarket OnStar FMV.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.800]   We saw that at CES, finally available today for 300 bucks.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.760]   Tomorrow in Portland, Oregon starts OSCON,
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.880]   O'Reilly's open source convention that runs through July 29th.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:49.480]   Wednesday, T-Mobile's HTC MyTouch 4G slide
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.560]   arrives for $200 on contract.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.880]   Thursday, July 28th, Sprint does their earnings,
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.560]   which will be interesting because they may
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.000]   announce a deal with Light Square.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.520]   Those are the folks putting up the satellites
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.600]   to give LTE wholesale.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.040]   And Sprint would be their first customer.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.680]   Of course, they still have to figure out their GPS issues.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.320]   And don't forget Friday, July 29th,
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.000]   the 12th Annual System Administrator Appreciation Day
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.120]   do something nice for your sysadmin on Friday.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:14.840]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.400]   We are going to do something nice for our sysadmin, actually.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.360]   Let them sleep.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.000]   Yes.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.760]   We won't call them that day.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.640]   Thank you, Tom Merritt.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.640]   That is across the way from us.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.040]   That's the TNT newsroom over there.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.600]   And that's where TNT is going to come from.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.520]   No longer do they have to come in here,
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.400]   rearrange all the cameras to do the news show.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.000]   That's just fantastic.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.840]   It was because there's cameras everywhere I look.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.800]   There's a camera.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.040]   There's 30 cameras in there.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.560]   And the thing is, with our video router and the TriCaster H850,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.480]   we're really able to do some amazing things.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.680]   For instance, even though most of the cameras are fixed,
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.520]   the TriCaster allows us to take a camera and zoom and pan.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.240]   And because we have such high resolution cameras, in effect,
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.560]   we can have movement on any of our cameras.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.080]   I mean, it's really quite amazing.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.440]   This is a very powerful system.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.640]   Here comes John. He not only found use some Diet Coke.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.600]   That works.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.200]   He found some wine back there.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.040]   Should we open the wine?
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.840]   Well, we had to.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.720]   No, it has to be--
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.400]   Are you taking that home?
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.760]   Yeah, we brought it for me.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.120]   It's a Mexican wine.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.320]   Mexican wine.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.920]   Yeah, actually, there's a little area in Mexico
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:19.880]   where they can actually grow wine.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.080]   It's called Serveza, John.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:21.560]   It's reasonable.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.960]   It didn't get much of a laugh.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:24.200]   It is.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.400]   No.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.240]   I'm getting Sarah in the--
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.680]   I'm getting Sarah in the feed right now.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.240]   Anyway, it's a Mexican wine, which I'm anxious to taste.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.160]   But right now, it's boiling hot.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.720]   Well, that's how Mexican wine shows up from Mexico.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.320]   That's how it's supposed to be served.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.120]   It needs to be boiling hot.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.760]   It's going to say it's how most things are down in Baja.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.280]   Yum.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.520]   So we are actually going to move off of Skype here.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.880]   We're going to start using a--
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.360]   Yes.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:48.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.480]   You've talked about this.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.120]   It's a company called Video.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.080]   I think it's going to be a lot better.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.440]   You and I have practiced with it a little bit.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.000]   Yep.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.440]   We're actually using their newsroom product,
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.480]   which is called Video Cast, V-I-D-Y-O-C-A-S-T.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:04.360]   Just in the nick of time, because the CEO of Skype
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.000]   said at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech Conference in Aspen
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.400]   this week, Tony Bates, said he might be putting advertisements
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:11.960]   in Skype--
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.400]   Right in the middle of a talk?
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.280]   Can you imagine?
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.200]   He got Steve giving some security now,
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:21.640]   and suddenly, not my ad, Skype's ad, pops up in it.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.560]   In-call advertising.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.440]   I was talking to somebody who was a friend of mine
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.840]   who has been working with a team of people in Silicon
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.600]   Valley developing some of these codecs,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.440]   and they wanted to compete with Skype.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.200]   And they claim that since Skype went to the VCs
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.960]   and now this has been sold again,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.120]   that the bit-- everything from the bit rate to the codec,
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.520]   everything has been changed where you need more bandwidth
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.800]   than ever to make--
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.320]   Why would that be?
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.800]   He had some cockamamie theory about it.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.200]   He said something to do with compatibility,
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.520]   down the road with something else, or who knows.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:54.920]   I don't know.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.760]   All I know is I was told that if you start looking at bandwidth
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.800]   and there's requirements on a Skype call now,
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.280]   and you actually get the monitor to put a scope on it,
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.960]   you're going to get different numbers than you used to.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.480]   It seems like, especially with the acquisition of Skype now
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.800]   from Microsoft for what was at $8.5 billion,
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.240]   there must be some pressure to monetize Skype big time.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.440]   Well, they want to turn into links,
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.800]   the links product, which Microsoft's crazy.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.240]   Terrible.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.960]   But advertising, can you imagine?
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:25.000]   I'm calling Mom to show her the baby's first steps,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.720]   but first this word from--
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.160]   From our sponsor.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.440]   I mean, it won't-- that's not going to work.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.160]   Yeah, it's not going to happen.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.840]   Tony Bates says, obviously, there's
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.880]   a very rich long--
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.040]   operative word rich, long-term advertising play.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.760]   The one I want to tease right now is in-call advertising.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:47.080]   The average length of a video call is now 27 minutes.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.120]   27 minutes, and you're doing a lot of things in that time.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.800]   If we're talking, you're not just looking at me,
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.080]   so we have a lot of opportunities.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.680]   So he says, what are they going to monitor the calls?
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.320]   And oh, he walked away.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:03.040]   Hey, can I show you an ad for Pizza Hut real quick?
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:03.960]   He says, why not?
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.360]   Why not?
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.920]   Because we have this intimate relationship.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.080]   At the end of the call, I share an ad with you.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.600]   And I hang up.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.760]   I'm thinking of all the incredibly inappropriate jingles
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.320]   that was coming up.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.040]   There's not a day before those hoax or something.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.400]   And the volume will be higher.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.000]   It's not.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.840]   This is serious.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.000]   That's what's kind of--
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.880]   No, it does just kill Skype instantly.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.600]   Yeah, there's so many other alternatives out there right now.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.600]   People would just jump away.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.520]   But I don't know.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.280]   Skype's built into Facebook now, so that gives them
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.520]   a lot of market share.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.040]   That's true.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.200]   What else is there that people know about?
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.360]   I know about stuff, because we are always looking
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.000]   at alternatives.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.480]   But what else?
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.760]   I mean, FaceTime is now a default icon on all new lion
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.280]   OS10s.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.040]   I have to think FaceTime is a flop.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.040]   You don't think so?
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:48.600]   Do you use it?
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.360]   I don't use it, but it's there if I want to use it.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.360]   You have an iPhone?
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.400]   You have a Macintosh?
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:52.960]   It's there all the time.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.240]   I definitely use it from phone to phone.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.640]   Like, if my sister calls in or something
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.560]   she wants to see my dog or whatever else, like--
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.200]   You've used it.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:00.480]   Really?
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.160]   Not that often, but you know, every couple of months.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.320]   Anybody else here use FaceTime?
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.280]   I don't.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.160]   A few people.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.520]   Gary, you used it?
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.240]   A couple of people.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:09.880]   Anybody else?
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.040]   So maybe out of 50 people, five.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:13.960]   Like, you know what?
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.520]   Move.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.120]   How many people do you hear own a Macintosh notebook,
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.960]   desktop, iPhone, iPad?
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.480]   Great.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.040]   Almost every phone.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:20.680]   Now, stop.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.200]   Everybody, everybody put your hands--
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.720]   You're not right, just if you use FaceTime on that device.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.000]   More than once.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:26.720]   OK.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.920]   We'll call that a flop.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   How many people are you--
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.880]   How many people are you--
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.040]   I have used iTunes?
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.680]   OK, I'm done.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.680]   Everybody's used iTunes.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.960]   You can go home now.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.040]   Although, I have to say--
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.280]   and I got some heat for this.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.320]   I said this a couple of weeks ago.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.920]   iTunes is a junkie program.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:42.760]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.320]   Are you kidding?
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.320]   It's awful.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:44.840]   It's flabby.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.880]   It's getting bloated.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.600]   It's poorly designed.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.920]   And last week, it wouldn't download.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.720]   If they're like, you know, you're constantly updating.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.920]   I had like 12 updates.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.640]   And so I said, OK, download them now.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.800]   And it just didn't.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.720]   The other thing was like the Java upgrades
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.920]   that are happening every five minutes on the PC.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.360]   Well, now Steve Gibson, we've talked
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.320]   about how Java is a source of security issues.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.000]   If you don't need Java, you shouldn't install it.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.320]   Well, guess what happens?
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.880]   The minute you install Lion, the very first thing that pops up,
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.640]   you need Java.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.080]   Everybody who's installing Lion, every Mac, in other words,
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:19.520]   now has Java.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.920]   Is that one a program request Java, and it's not installed?
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.120]   And apparently--
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.560]   I launched Photoshop, and it was like, you need Java.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.120]   And I'm like, all right.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.280]   I don't think it was Photoshop.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.760]   I think that there is a--
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.920]   and somebody in the chat room could probably correct me.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.240]   It happened very quickly for me.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.640]   But it looked like there was a service that runs under Lion
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.360]   that almost immediately runs when you first install Lion
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.400]   and says, hey, you got to have Java.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.800]   And it was the very first thing--
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.000]   Well, wouldn't they just bundle Java then at that point?
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.120]   Well, could be the lawsuits.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.960]   You saw that Oracle is not real happy right now with Google.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.880]   Because Android is a Java based--
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.240]   it's Linux, but Java's on top of it.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.160]   Although Oracle did-- or Google did agree to belly up
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.520]   and pay the flight.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.360]   Is that the latest?
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.440]   What's the vig going to be?
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.240]   I don't know.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.160]   It's not going to be cheap.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:07.960]   Because at one point, somebody was
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.280]   saying, it's going to cost an extra $20 per Android device.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:10.920]   No, I don't know.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.760]   That would feel the Android market blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.360]   It's like, no.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.040]   According to-- I think this happened on Friday, Oracle
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:21.160]   must curb Android damage's claim.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.260]   They have to lower their claim for damages
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.920]   versus Google to $100 million.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.000]   But in return, the judge says, you get to subpoena Larry Page.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.240]   And what you can ask Larry is, did Google
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:38.440]   willfully infringe on Java patents?
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.120]   I can't imagine Larry's going to say yes.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.920]   But I guess if you're under oath and a deposition--
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.440]   And if there's records and documents
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:52.040]   and conversations, Google was asking for $6.1 billion.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:52.720]   Wait, Google.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.120]   No, no, no.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.840]   I mean, Oracle against Google.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.120]   But the judge said $100 million US district judge William
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:05.840]   Alsop said he wanted both parties to be more reasonable.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.440]   I'm surprised they didn't attempt
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.320]   to overturn the patent.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.600]   It must be a strong patent.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.280]   And I'm sure certainly Google would have looked at it
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.960]   and made a determination that it was damned.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:16.960]   John, maybe you know this.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.080]   I think sometimes companies go, yeah, there's a patent.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.200]   Let's take a chance.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.080]   Actually, I talked to a guy--
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.520]   I can't remember the name of the company,
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.360]   but I had a long chat with the CEO who was a company back.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.000]   He said Microsoft basically lost the case
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.720]   to just recently for $260 something million or more.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.080]   And the guy had a long theory.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:34.520]   He said--
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.320]   Does this die for I case?
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.040]   You know, I can't--
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:37.920]   It's a specific American.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.360]   Because there's so many of these cases
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.560]   Microsoft keeps losing.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.000]   Infinite.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.800]   He said that he's totally convinced that Microsoft just
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.880]   steals the patents and then worries about it later.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.360]   And then he says if you do the numbers,
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:53.440]   they end up having to pay what the fees might have been.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.840]   But meanwhile, his company's out of business.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.400]   He says we could have grown into be a billion dollar company
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.080]   for all he knows.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.400]   Yeah, he's got $260 million now.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.000]   But he could have been a contender, as it were.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.520]   And he thinks they do it overtly because the courts will not
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.520]   do treble damages.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.200]   He says they're too wimpy to do that.
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.680]   I for I is the case at point--
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.280]   I think that might be--
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.240]   Yeah, it's a Canadian company.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.720]   $300 million.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:22.840]   Microsoft, I'm sure, just said, hey, this is an XML code issue
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.360]   in Office.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.200]   Yeah, this was this guy.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.840]   And Microsoft, I'm sure, said, yeah, there's a patent.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.760]   Yeah, we could get sued.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.920]   Yeah, probably what happens is they immediately
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.000]   ask for a license.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Microsoft says sue us.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.960]   And at the end of the day, $300 million,
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.880]   how much money does Microsoft make on Office?
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.120]   It's a pittance.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.480]   And somebody actually has to find a lawyer
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.840]   and go through the process of tying their life in knots
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.920]   while their business is being destroyed for years.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.420]   Years.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.760]   To get through to the tail end of that fight.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.640]   Yes, like three years.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.240]   This guy had done business in Microsoft
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.800]   before he had something to do with Softie Marsh.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.280]   And--
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:53.800]   Barmer, yeah.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.080]   But his theory was that--
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.640]   and it's a craptious, throwing stuff against the wall.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.680]   He believes that you just steal a bunch of patents.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.760]   One of them takes off.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.280]   They get noticed by the other guys.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.840]   And they say, well, we're going to sue you.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.800]   He said, fine.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.120]   Meanwhile, they get to test a lot of different technologies.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.480]   Nobody else is going to sue them.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.400]   It's not worth the trouble.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.880]   And the company's ruined.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.120]   And that seems to be-- he believes it's a Silicon Valley.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.960]   Something that's floating around in the ether that
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.160]   has been established as a way to do it.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.640]   So here's an interesting story.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.880]   So I would say you could argue that the open spectrum
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.360]   at 2.4 gigahertz, which has been used for Wi-Fi,
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:35.000]   might have been the single most valuable incentive
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.360]   to innovation in networking.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.080]   The fact that you didn't have to get a license.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.560]   You didn't have to go to the FCC.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.360]   You could just make a device.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.040]   We wouldn't have Wi-Fi, I think, if 2.4 gigahertz
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.280]   were unregulated spectrum.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:48.920]   You agree, Steve?
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.120]   I mean--
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.960]   There are a number of things that made this revolution happen.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.800]   But that's one of them.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.240]   Yes.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.800]   So Republicans have just proposed forbidding the FCC
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.600]   from allocating any more unlicensed spectrum for Wi-Fi
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.360]   and other uses.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.360]   Unless they give wireless companies the opportunity
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.120]   to buy exclusive licenses first.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:14.680]   So there's a bill in effect that would end white spaces,
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.200]   that would end this kind of growth in Wi-Fi,
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.720]   because, in fact, public knowledge has issued an action alert,
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:27.880]   because Congress is considering offering it
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.520]   to the wireless companies first.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.840]   These wireless companies, you know,
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.440]   I just saw the AT&T doubled its lobbying in the last quarter.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.320]   Of course, that's because of the T-Mobile thing.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.080]   But these companies are very aggressive about lobbying.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.320]   They spent the two biggest lobbyists in Washington,
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.560]   either last year or the year before,
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.080]   was $11 million, AT&T, and Verizon.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.160]   And lo and behold, when the FCC finally comes out with its--
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:49.640]   What a shock.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.800]   Yeah, with its reach.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.000]   You know, we're going to regulate the internet
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.600]   by not regulating the internet.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.720]   And by the way, the mobile internet doesn't count.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.200]   And it's like, don't tell me that there is no tie-in
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.440]   between spending $11 million in Washington, DC,
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.640]   and all the sudden--
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.760]   Get in the result you want.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.400]   Yeah, Gates, AT&T getting the resulting one.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.680]   Verizon getting the result they want.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.920]   This is a perfect example.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.880]   I mean, it's essentially Congress saying, well,
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.040]   that open stuff's fine.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.360]   But you know, Verizon, if you'd rather pay us for it,
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:23.160]   we'd be glad to let you have the first access.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.880]   All right, who's Spotify users here?
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.560]   Any Spotify users?
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.280]   A few people.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.000]   Cool, isn't it?
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.400]   70,000 users.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.480]   What is it?
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:34.840]   Good question.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.040]   It's like, "Arteo."
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.320]   It's music.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.360]   It's-- you probably didn't care about this kind of thing.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.720]   You barely got me on Netflix.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.800]   You just got on Netflix.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.040]   We'll get you on Spotify.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.000]   I love Spotify.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.440]   I'm actually a huge Spotify fan.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.160]   It is streaming music service.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.120]   They have a free tier, a $5 tier.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.680]   And if you want the full access to theirs, what is it?
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.480]   It's 13 million record library on all devices.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.040]   It's $10 a month.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.440]   Worth it.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.360]   I paid $10 a month.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.440]   I used to have Mogg, and then I had Artio.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.520]   But I like Spotify even better.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.160]   Do you publish public playlists, things like that?
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:08.760]   I haven't yet.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.080]   But I just started using it.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.640]   Basically, I went out and did the research
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.080]   and figured out that they have, by far, the most tracks.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.720]   So that's one thing I was curious about.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.720]   So you look for obscure weirdo tracks.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.960]   Well, I mean, if you just look at total available tracks
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.320]   that are out there, I mean, there
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.680]   are several million above the next biggest one.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.920]   See, I could follow you because there's Kevin Rose's
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.400]   playlist.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.760]   So if you start to add some public playlists,
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.560]   I will see them on Artio.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.160]   And somebody did something interesting.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.960]   A woman named Jennifer Ruggiero posted on Google.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.720]   She said, let's see, can we make a public playlist
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.960]   that people can add to?
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.360]   So she published the link.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.920]   This is one of the things I like about Spotify.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.720]   You can publish a URL to the playlist, which anybody
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.840]   can click on, subscribe to, and then add to.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.200]   So she picked a bunch of songs with a word circle
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.880]   for Google's plus in it.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.280]   And then look at all these people have added songs
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.800]   and made this a public playlist by a lot of different people.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.120]   You can make a playlist and have people add to it.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.480]   And then you could subscribe to it.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.640]   And the beauty of this is I don't have any of these songs,
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.280]   because I'm subscribing to Artio.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.320]   I could play this entire playlist.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.280]   Can I also did an integration with Sonos, too,
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.400]   which is really quite nice.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.160]   That's what I use.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.920]   We have Sonos all over the studio.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.240]   So every office has a Sonos S5 or an S3.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.760]   So why does everybody in the chat room
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.360]   say one of two things about Spotify?
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.120]   One, they say Spotify rules.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.480]   And the other one say Spotify equals bait and switch.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.560]   Why is that?
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   I don't know.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.680]   They did offer in the US, which they haven't offered
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680]   in Europe before.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.440]   It just came to the US two weeks ago.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.000]   They did offer pretty much an unlimited listening for free.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.160]   In Europe, I think you got 20 hours a month.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.200]   You could only listen to a certain number of times
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:41.800]   to each song.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.560]   These are restrictions.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.320]   The record industry places on them.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.800]   Of course, I mean, I'm sure they don't
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.720]   want to have limitations on it.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.040]   What's the bait and switch, though?
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:50.520]   I guess the--
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.120]   You get it for--
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.840]   --the count is bait/switch.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.840]   The bait is tasty.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.520]   It's good bait.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.280]   And then they try--
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:55.840]   And they try--
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.680]   --and they try for you and me.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.480]   I'm actually a huge fan.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.680]   And my people keep saying they're going to jack up the prices
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.200]   on you.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.920]   They're going to lock in and then screw you.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.800]   Just like Netflix.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.320]   Well, the good news on that is--
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.400]   The good news?
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.400]   Well, there's MOG, there's RDO, there's Rhapsody, there's
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.200]   Napster, there's Zoon.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.840]   The Zoon marketplace, 15 bucks, you get 10 free songs.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.040]   There's so much competition.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.480]   There's more competition in this space than any other.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.920]   For 15 bucks, you get 10 whole free songs?
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.880]   And unlimited streaming.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.480]   Holy crap.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   And anything in their library.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.680]   But you get to keep 10 songs.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.680]   Oh, there's waffles too.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.000]   Because there's waffles?
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.360]   What's waffles?
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:32.880]   It's like--
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.200]   Is it come with chicken?
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.360]   No, it's a music site.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.280]   I never heard of it.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.400]   But see, that's an example.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.000]   There's turntable.fm.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.040]   That's fun.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.680]   If I buy CDs, I get to keep the music forever.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.520]   I don't have to pay 15 bucks over and over again to access
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.760]   that music when I actually have a streaming connection that
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:48.760]   works.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.400]   It's worth any format you want.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.960]   Did you say buy CDs?
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.680]   Where do you buy still buy CDs?
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.200]   No.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.200]   You know why?
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.840]   Because I often find myself in places
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.080]   where I can't stream music.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.120]   I've had tracks drop out.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.000]   That's a good point.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.160]   Yeah, but why not just download them and put them on your--
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:03.800]   They do.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.600]   Mostly because most of the--
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.120]   If I can say to that playlist, put it on my phone.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.000]   And then if I'm offline--
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.600]   Why would I pay almost as much for a 192K track when I can at least
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.520]   get the CD audio?
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.040]   I have CDs in my refrigerator.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.520]   Right.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.640]   He has 10 copies.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.440]   10 copies of the line is refrigerated.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.840]   Just in case, if they ever discontinue,
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.240]   Frampton comes alive.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.240]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.240]   And then we're going to break out the champagne because--
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:30.600]   Incomprehensible.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:35.840]   I think finally, the Winklevi are gone for good.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.800]   What's that mean?
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.680]   Oh, you'll find out just a moment.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.360]   Do you audible?
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:40.880]   Audible?
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.440]   What about it?
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.520]   Do you ever listen?
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.360]   I have the-- you know what I like?
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.520]   I find it discovered.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.720]   No, I'm not going to say it because you're
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.680]   going to do an audible commercial.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.320]   I'm not going to discuss the fact that the public library
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.960]   is one of my favorite places to go.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.320]   I know.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.360]   I understand that.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.080]   And I don't think that that's a-- but the problem with it
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.240]   is limited selection and copy protection.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.720]   What's the problem at the library?
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.360]   How many weeks do you have to listen to that book?
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.200]   I don't really go to the library.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200]   I just--
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:06.800]   I can tell you.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.040]   It's two weeks, right?
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.840]   And it's like you have to renew it.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.720]   But it's digital.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.440]   I don't-- you have to renew a digital copy.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.320]   Well, you know, if I was really into audible books
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.440]   on tape or anything, then I would be a major, major,
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.280]   major subscriber to audible.com.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.040]   Thank you very much.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.400]   I just got-- I just got zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.360]   Classic.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.040]   It's a classic.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:31.520]   Classic.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.520]   Class long, though.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.640]   Well, I've tried-- that's a really good example
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.960]   because I have tried to read that book in print.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.460]   Right.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.920]   About 20 times.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.440]   Right.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.960]   And I never did.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960]   And then I got it on Audible, and you can listen to it.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.880]   Yeah, I got it on Audible.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.880]   I listened to the entire thing.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.320]   I'm still an hour out still.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.880]   It's a-- how long does it say I want to do?
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.720]   It's 15 hours.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.920]   Do you have commuting in your life?
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.640]   The gym time.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.560]   Oh, and gym time.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.560]   Perfect.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   That's when I read.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.080]   You too.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.280]   So I used to have the Kindle on the stand on the exercise.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.240]   But it's too hard.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.640]   You're going like this.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.200]   And it's too hard.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.160]   So you listen, and they're reading to you.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.040]   It's nice.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.200]   This is actually a great recommendation, Robert
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.080]   Persig said in the art of motorcycle maintenance.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.640]   You could get that free right now.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.880]   In fact, you get two books free.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.120]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you'll
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.120]   sign up for the gold account.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.880]   That's two books a month.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.240]   First month is free.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.000]   The books are yours to keep forever.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.640]   If you look at my library, Kevin--
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.680]   I've been doing this since screensabers.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.040]   I've been doing this for 11 years.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.400]   I've almost been around for a long time.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.240]   Yeah, I started in 2000.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.400]   I have 500 books in my library.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.080]   And what's nice is I can go back and listen to these books
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.160]   any time, because your library is always yours.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.440]   Unlike the public library, where two weeks later,
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.880]   you've got to go renew it.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.840]   Nothing wrong with the public library.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.800]   Nothing wrong with the public library.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.800]   I'm married to a librarian.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.440]   There is a librarian.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.560]   And I love the library.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.400]   I think it's great.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.000]   But I'm telling you, I like the idea
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.800]   that I could take as long-- I just finished Peter F.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800]   Hamels and the boys' villages.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.000]   It's the boys' villages.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.040]   Which is-- no, I've not quite.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.160]   I have six more hours.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.720]   But that's like 80 hours.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.800]   If I had to renew that every two weeks, I would never
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.640]   finished it.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   So it's really nice to have the-- look at this.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.400]   It's war and peace.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.000]   I mean, this goes on and on and on.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.520]   Hundreds of books.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.560]   I love it.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.320]   Try it today.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.880]   If you haven't yet tried Audible, Audible--
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.440]   It's over the gym.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:23.880]   It really is.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.960]   It is great for the gym.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.320]   Do you rock climb with Audible?
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:26.820]   No.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.920]   No, because if you rock--
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.840]   You have to focus.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.800]   You have to focus if you're kind of--
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.080]   You don't listen to like rock and roll?
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:32.580]   No.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.640]   Why is it-- is it because it's like a puzzle?
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.200]   Well, that in your moving your arms around.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.280]   And if you get your headphones entangled, like--
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:38.880]   That would be bad.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.480]   Full right off the wall.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.840]   And what's with that?
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.000]   Not that often, actually.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.080]   But I need to get back into it.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.000]   You should use to go to Mission Rock, all of this.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.560]   Mission clips, yeah.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.920]   She comes with Sarah and Sheamus and I.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:54.000]   We started to-- You used to go to--
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.400]   No way, you're going now?
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.320]   I cannot see this guy in a rock.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.320]   What are you eating?
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.320]   Solid.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   Get salad.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   Some poor staffer at Twitt's going to go to get their lunch
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   in an hour and be like, what?
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.280]   You got to write your name on the lunch in the fridge
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.800]   or just with the work.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.400]   You saw the Zingermans, right?
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.600]   Did you see the-- yeah.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.440]   Did you see the brick?
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.160]   I brought a brick out.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.920]   Oh, look at that.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.160]   It's not-- by the way, sometimes people
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.200]   think that it's too late to buy a brick.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.520]   It isn't, just because we've opened it.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.720]   These are the 8x8 bricks.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.680]   You can get a logo on there.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.800]   I know Gary, you bought one.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.240]   Thank you.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.040]   I appreciate a lot of people brought these bricks.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.400]   We had no agenda brick bought for us.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.280]   Did you?
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.400]   Awesome.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.520]   I hope you put it in there in the morning.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.360]   Well, and you know, we have time in the--
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.640]   In the club from NSFW.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.480]   We have a lot of different kind of--
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.400]   It feels like-- this is our-- it's our Kana.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.960]   It feels like it's the masons have taken over it
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.860]   in the back there.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:44.720]   So we got a wall.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.800]   The wall is right behind me.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.280]   We're going to fill that wall up.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.560]   I cannot wait to see the bricks.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.560]   When you come back for the party--
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:49.920]   Is this the part thick?
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.600]   All of them?
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.920]   No, that's the commemorative brick.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.000]   So if you buy the commemorative brick,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:53.480]   you get that.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.160]   But the bricks are thin little veneer, really.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.640]   They're only about a quarter of an inch thick.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.120]   Still a chance to go to bricks.twit.tv.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.800]   This was a very expensive place to build.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.520]   You want to guess?
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.240]   $1.1 million.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.840]   There's my CFO CEO.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.080]   What does she say?
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.640]   No, I'm off by a 0.1.2.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.320]   So those bricks make a huge difference.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.160]   We've sold 1,000.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.560]   We hope to sell at least 1,000 more.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.080]   Wow.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.320]   It really makes a big difference.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.480]   So did you buy the building, too?
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.960]   No.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.240]   So you're asking a really--
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.440]   see, this is where your business--
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.000]   That's a touchy point.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.040]   So I put a lot of money into a building I don't own.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:31.540]   Right.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.920]   That means you're going to stay here forever.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.120]   We have a long lease.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.560]   I think we will get the benefit out of this.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.320]   And the truth is I probably will buy the building.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.240]   Because I just-- I think this is so great.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.360]   Wouldn't we buy this?
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:44.720]   Yes.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.560]   I mean, it's so great.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.240]   You have to put bricks everywhere if you're going
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:48.640]   to buy the building.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.120]   That's a lot.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:49.800]   That's a hell of a lot.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.800]   Bricks in the bathroom.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.560]   That's a hell of a lot of bricks.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.360]   Either that or I could sue Mark Zuckerberg saying,
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.760]   I invented Facebook.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.040]   That might be a way to make a little bit of money.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:00.600]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:00.960]   No, no, no.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.280]   You forgot sue, get a payoff, and then get pissed off
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.320]   because you realized how much more--
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.840]   It wasn't enough.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.240]   It wasn't enough.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.440]   I want more.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.480]   So here's good news.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.120]   The Winklevi.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.640]   We all know about them because of this movie,
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   The Social Network.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:18.400]   The twins, the crew rowers, who say that they with Harvard
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.080]   connect, they invented Facebook.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.920]   They hired little sophomore Mark Zuckerberg to code it.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.760]   He put them off.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.160]   He put them off.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.800]   Finally, he says, you know what, guys?
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.120]   I'm going to do the Facebook instead.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.840]   And they were pissed.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.960]   You remember that this week, Larry Summers, who
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.320]   was the president of Harvard at the time--
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.560]   and he's great in the movie.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.640]   Remember that where they go into the president of Harvard?
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.840]   And he says, you're men of Harvard.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.400]   Come up with another idea.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.080]   He says, what are you--
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.960]   you're asking me to come up with them?
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.520]   Apparently, that was fairly accurate
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.880]   because they were interviewing Summers at a conference
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.040]   this week, and he called them A-holes.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.000]   No, what do you say?
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   What do you say?
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.320]   Oh, he says, any time a sophomore comes in your office
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.880]   wearing a tie in a jacket or something
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.280]   on those lines, you're probably dealing with a couple of holes.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.440]   Well, you can say that.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440]   This is a family show.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.840]   No, I'd like to see the real guys instead of the actors.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.160]   Well, here's the real guys.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.280]   If you pull up the picture on my screen,
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.880]   they actually are pretty darn handsome.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.000]   They got a settlement of $60 million.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.480]   Wow.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.600]   And we're not happy.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.200]   They said that Facebook lied to us about their actual value.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.280]   They went back to court.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.800]   First, they were going to the Supreme Court.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.720]   They dropped that Supreme Court case in June,
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.680]   went back to Boston on Friday.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:43.240]   US District Judge Douglas Woodlock dismissed the case,
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.480]   saying, you're a bunch of assholes.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:50.360]   No, I didn't say that.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.480]   But I think it might be over.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.720]   So do they lose their $60 or do they get to keep their $60?
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.440]   They get to keep the same settlement.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.160]   Because they want them to have the--
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.480]   the original settlement--
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.480]   Nullified.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.320]   Wouldn't that be a just--
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.440]   Yeah, then pull it, pull it, pull it $60 back.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.560]   Oh, that wasn't enough.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.360]   Sorry, guys.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.640]   We'll take it back.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   Thanks.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.920]   Um, so that's, I think, although you never know.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.800]   I think the end of it, although their attorney, Tyler
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.280]   Mead, who was probably the guy making the most money on this,
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.760]   said Friday, he would be submitting a post-judgment motion
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.240]   relying on a federal rule that allows judges to reopen a case
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.440]   if vital information was not produced.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:36.400]   So seven years in, and we're still fighting over this silly thing.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.200]   There's another picture of the Winklevi.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.920]   These guys look like a couple of characters.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.560]   They're rich.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.160]   Well, they're like Olympic athletes, too.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.320]   And they've--
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.920]   They're busy doing other stuff.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.080]   They're men of Harvard.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.360]   Get another idea.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.720]   Summers was being interviewed by Walter Isaacson
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.920]   at the Aspen Institute.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.400]   Actually, it was Fortune's Brainstorm Tech Conference.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.120]   And Isaacson said, was that seen in the social network
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.240]   true?
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.680]   Summers said, oh, I've heard it said I could be arrogant.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:10.040]   If that's true, I surely was on that occasion.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:10.800]   This is your quote.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.560]   One of the things you learn as a college president,
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.840]   if an undergraduate's wearing a tie in jacket on Thursday
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.600]   afternoon at 3 o'clock, there are two possibilities.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.920]   One is they're looking for a job and have an interview.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.760]   The other is they're a--
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.000]   this was the latter case.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.600]   You know, it's funny because we could say,
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.760]   like five minutes ago, we were on the podcast basically
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:32.240]   being like Microsoft crushing independence, evil, stealing
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:32.840]   ideas.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.800]   And now basically, we've got the same thing only
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.360]   with an actual idea, not like a software patentable idea.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.640]   And I think because these guys are at Harvard and also pretty,
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.560]   so you think that they're--
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.760]   You think that they're a merit to what they're asking?
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.120]   I think it's a messy case.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.640]   I think this is why there are contracts.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.440]   I think this is why there are lawyers.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.280]   I think this is why it's really difficult to start a business
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.760]   out of your dorm room and not get stomped on if it explodes.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.160]   Ideas are a dime, it does.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.440]   Absolutely.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.800]   So it's having an idea in and of itself, especially an idea
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.800]   that my space at Friendster already has.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.680]   I don't think two winkle losses are the equivalent
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.120]   of one Zuckerberg.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:11.680]   I mean--
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.120]   No, and anyone who's actually ever created something
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.280]   as we all have knows how much more--
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:16.760]   That's hard.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.880]   Yes, I mean, people are coming up saying, oh, I have a great idea.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.280]   I'll go 50/50 with you.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:21.600]   Right.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.520]   It's like, don't tell me.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.920]   I don't want to hear it.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.640]   Here's one for you, Kevin, because I
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.480]   know you're the guy who actually got me hooked on Angry Birds.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.360]   You son of a--
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360]   Yes.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.360]   So he hooked on what?
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.160]   Angry Birds?
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.560]   Oh, please.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.840]   He's a big Angry Birds guy.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.960]   Yeah, it looks like he looks a little bit like he's
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.080]   an Angry Bird himself.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.760]   Like six months ago, something like that.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.800]   You've outgrown it.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.960]   Yeah, I mean, it just--
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.360]   What's your passion now?
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.320]   It's so 2010.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.920]   Super Stick Man Golf.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.920]   Yeah, baby.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.520]   I know, I did.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.440]   It's amazing.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:50.960]   What?
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.040]   Super Stick Man Golf.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.080]   You're a little stick figure and you play multiplayer golf
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.160]   against your friends.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.040]   That does sound awesome.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.040]   It's awesome.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:57.880]   Is that a wonderful?
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.360]   Yeah, it's on the iPhone.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.800]   I might have to get that.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.960]   The new Roku 2.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.440]   HD, XD and XS.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.640]   Same price, smaller size, and Angry Birds.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.160]   Yes.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:09.920]   On the Roku?
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.680]   On the Roku.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   I don't think it's a good deal.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.240]   You're going to have it on HD.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.680]   And a special motion controller like a Nintendo Wii.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.120]   Oh, my god.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.600]   We moat that will let you play Angry Birds sitting on the couch.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.800]   They smack those birds.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.280]   Did you hear about the rumor that the next Apple TV update
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.800]   is going to finally enable the Bluetooth chip inside the Apple TV?
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.840]   There's a Bluetooth chip in that thing.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.640]   There's a Bluetooth chip.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   There's a reason for this one.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.640]   There's a reason for this one.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   There's a reason for this one right now.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640]   Wow.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.640]   They're talking about there might be a controller for it.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   They might enable apps to be installed.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.640]   Wow, that's really interesting.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.040]   You could have Angry Birds on your Apple TV.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.040]   Wow.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:47.320]   I want to ask you about this because this kind of bugs me.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.000]   The story about the Reddit founder-- I'm going to see if I can find this story because
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.800]   it's coming up 404 on Boiling.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.920]   They're liberating several million servers.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:02.360]   I'm wondering about-- if anybody has an insight to this--
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:06.360]   Give us a background on this quick.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:12.980]   So, Aaron Schwartz, co-founder of Reddit, has been indicted on charges of stealing documents
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:15.420]   from the Massachusetts Institute of Technologies.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.880]   Oh, yeah, from the Jase Store.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880]   Oh, yeah, T-com me up.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.880]   T-com me up.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.880]   I downloaded too much stuff, right?
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.380]   Why did you download all of that?
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:23.880]   If you only downloaded half of it, it had been fine.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.880]   Well, then the download--
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.880]   Well, it wasn't a problem story.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.880]   What was the deal?
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880]   Okay.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.280]   So, 4 million documents over three months.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.680]   He was charged with wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information for
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.200]   a protected computer, recklessly damaging a protected computer.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.480]   Here's the issue.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.400]   First of all, I don't think this guy's a hacker.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400]   He's a Harvard fellow.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.840]   He found a demand progress, which is an activist nonprofit.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.840]   One of the things that's in these J-Store documents-- this is a nonprofit research archive--
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:03.520]   is a bunch of public domain scientific documents they've collected and charged for.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:09.320]   So it's possible-- in fact, according to the indictment, this was his intent.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:15.520]   He wanted to take those, liberate those articles, which are part of our scientific heritage,
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.720]   make them freely available.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.680]   He was going to put them on bit torrent sites.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:27.280]   I hear someone in academia over there squealing with joy in the background.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.320]   Is that a good thing?
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:34.920]   Well, do you think Aaron Schwartz is a scapegoat or do you think he's a criminal?
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.120]   He committed-- misunderstood.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.120]   He's misunderstood.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.920]   He misunderstood loner.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:48.160]   But he's also-- he basically-- there's nothing wrong with committing an act of civil disobedience,
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.640]   but if you caught, you're still going to get punished.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.800]   That's a good point.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.800]   So it makes it civil disobedience.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.000]   Because he went out of his way to create applications or have somebody else create applications
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.560]   that would download an extraordinary number of titles off of this as quickly as possible.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.840]   We're seeing multiple accounts.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.720]   Possibly-- what they're saying is he broke into a closet, grabbed a couple of IP addresses,
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:11.360]   and we're doing alternate downloads to grab as many of these documents as possible, which
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.360]   is awesome.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.600]   Hey, let the information be free, especially if it's public information to begin with.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.760]   But the service-- and I'm sure MIT are supremely pissed off about this right now.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.960]   Four million documents.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.920]   That's a lot of data.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.160]   I feel that there's more to this story, to be honest with you.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   Yeah, I would agree with you.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.520]   Well, if you're MIT and somebody sneaks in from Harvard and cracks into your network
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.560]   and uses it to steal documents, I think that's probably a point of pride and being really
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.560]   pissed off, too.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:46.760]   Well, and in fact, he probably did commit a crime, and he's verifiably provable that
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   he committed a crime.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.680]   It was like it's also-- he had access to them on a limited basis, but he wanted to get around
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.680]   their throttling controls, so he had to use multiple IPs.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.280]   I think he wanted to free the information.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.880]   I think information wants to be free.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.280]   He wanted to be the conduit.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:06.560]   His argument is that these files all predate 1923, which means these files are in public
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.920]   domain, and that JSTOR--
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.920]   Interesting.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.320]   --has been taking public domain documents and charging.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.320]   It's very expensive.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:19.240]   Do you know, sir, how much it costs to get a document from JSTOR?
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.400]   I don't know, but they're electrocuting us back there, very expensive.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.240]   We're putting a light on the guy.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.240]   Wow.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:31.120]   Welcome to TWIT.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.040]   I think this is interesting.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:42.920]   Gregory Maxwell has posted a 32 gigabyte file on Pirate Bay, says that Aaron Schwartz inspired
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920]   the document release.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.400]   He says, "All too often, journals, galleries, and museums are becoming not disseminators
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:54.680]   of knowledge, as their lofty mission statements suggest, but sensors of knowledge, charging
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.440]   for stuff that ought to be free."
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.440]   Public domain is public domain.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.320]   It's been an attack on public domain forever.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.320]   What did you just say?
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.360]   Public domain is effectively dead.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.840]   Did you hear what he just said?
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.840]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840]   Couldn't be wrong.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.840]   I love public domain.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.840]   No, I know.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:09.840]   I know.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:10.840]   That's probably--
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.840]   The lawyers at Disney effectively killed public domain.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.840]   That's right.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.240]   It's a disservice to the public at large.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:20.160]   No, no, but the best part is after they realized after they killed public domain in the courts,
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.320]   they turned around and realized all they had to do was trademark the mouse and their
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.800]   other characters and they could sit on them legally forever.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.680]   So after they screwed up public domain for the entire nation--
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.680]   Right.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.280]   --and arguably for the-- you know, complicating it for the world and our government is spending
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.920]   extraordinary efforts to try to put in extraordinary copyright controls in other countries to
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.600]   basically at the behest of the RIA and the MPAA.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.320]   And look, I want people to get paid.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.640]   Well, that's why this is a good test case because all these documents are pre-Mickey
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   mouse era.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.400]   They're all true public domain documents.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.280]   Jay Stewart would argue, yeah, but we collected them, scanned them, made available online.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.280]   We have expenses and costs.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.280]   We made them indexable and that's why we charge you $19 to get these documents.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:06.120]   And yet I'm pretty sure that both Schwartz and this other guy, Maxwell, are-- it says,
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.960]   in fact, in this article on ours Technica, are part of a broader campaign to open up public
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.320]   access to academic work.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.400]   Actually, Doctor O is good on this topic.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.800]   He's one of his specialties.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.880]   And he would say that this is bull crap because once something's public domain, it's public
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.880]   domain.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.960]   You could do what-- if you want to do stuff, fine, but wait a minute.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.800]   You only have to sell it legally.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.520]   But what J-Stor is saying is like, great, go out and scan all these documents, go to,
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.600]   you know, 1,000 universities with a scanner and do the OCR.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.800]   That's exactly what Doctor O addresses.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.960]   He says that that's bull crap.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.240]   You can't get access.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.800]   Once something is public domain, it's public domain no matter how you get a hold of it,
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   it's still public domain even if you took it off the J-Stor site.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.960]   This will be an interesting case, I think, because I think that that's going to be the
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   argument.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.040]   I would think someone is going to be a precedent maker and it's going to be interesting.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.760]   Luckily, he's got money.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.400]   He does, because he sold it to Conde Nast and I think he made a little bit of money from
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.360]   Reddit, which is still a great site.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.320]   Conde did not kill Reddit.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.320]   So which way does a Supreme Court call on this?
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.960]   I'm sure you wish they had, but Conde Nast killed Reddit.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.240]   The more social news sites, the better.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.240]   The better.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.640]   Hey, this has been a really great way to kick off the Twitter cast.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.520]   I want to thank all you guys for coming here.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.520]   Absolutely.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.320]   Steve Gibson for flying all this way through fog, sleet, snow, hail, and then driving up
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.320]   19th Avenue.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:24.720]   Steve is the host of our security national, which we will do from the Brick House on Wednesday.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.280]   I don't know how, but with video cast instead of Skype.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:34.560]   I'm hoping that our video should look a lot better even with these long distance calls.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.560]   You'll be a good test case.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.560]   I think you're going to be the first.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.440]   In fact, I know you are.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.440]   Cool.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.440]   So that'll be fun.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.440]   That's the best security now.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.760]   And of course, his website, grc.com, where you'll find Spinrite, which we have to give
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:47.520]   a plug for because we've all used it and love it.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.720]   Spinrite is the best file or hard drive recovery and maintenance utility.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.720]   grc.com.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:56.120]   Kevin Rose is Mr. Milk.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.680]   Should I have served you milk today?
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.680]   Sure.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.680]   You should.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.680]   I'm just thinking.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.680]   He likes to be a bear famous.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.280]   You put beer on the map.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.280]   Yes.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.720]   Maybe here's an opportunity for you to think of a milk thing.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.520]   Wouldn't that be like a trademark?
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.520]   You drink milk all the time.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.520]   No, I don't think so.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.520]   Thank you.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.560]   It's good for your bones.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.560]   They say that.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:22.000]   We could always have a bottle of milk and they called him the milk man.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.440]   He's carried around with me wherever I go.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.440]   No.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.440]   Thank you.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.600]   I'm just trying to help.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.080]   Can we find out more about what you're doing?
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.080]   Yes.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.080]   So milkinc.com, you can send it for the newsletter there and then also oink.com is our first project.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.080]   Oh, so you already have something going on.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.080]   It's called Oink.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.120]   You have to wait and see.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.720]   I'll show you in a couple of weeks.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.280]   Oink.com I got to go there.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.120]   How did you get that URL?
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.120]   It was available.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.120]   No, I paid for it.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.120]   Poker game.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120]   What did you pay for it?
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.520]   I paid $25,000 for it.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.520]   That's not bad.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.320]   That's not bad.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:02.640]   Google paid $1.75 million for G.co.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640]   I did not.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:07.280]   Those single letter dot coke designates are expensive.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.280]   I think they--
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.360]   What I'm seeing now is, who is it that wrote a really good piece on this?
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360]   One of the angel investors.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:19.160]   Fred wrote a piece on about the average domain price now for a new startup is around $50,
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.160]   grand.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.160]   Wow.
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.000]   If you want the proper dot com--
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Wow.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.320]   But now there's a lot of-- you know, when you're doing just apps only, we happen to have a destination
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.320]   site that goes along with this.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.320]   Right.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.320]   But if you're just doing an app, then it really doesn't matter, right?
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.320]   Right.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320]   You could be on cap.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.320]   That's what you were on Twitter.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   On Twitter we're on--
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.320]   There's always some way around it.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.920]   Like buying a vanity domain these days makes any sense.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.920]   I really don't.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:42.280]   It's funny I try to get the guy that owns @Oink on Twitter and he wanted $10,000 for it.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.880]   I'm like, "Shh, come on dude."
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.880]   Oink, really?
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.800]   So, o-i-n-k dot com.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.800]   Look at this.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.880]   We get a hint of what it is.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:57.280]   Rate the adventure, life's an adventure, vote, rank, and share the world around you.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.280]   So it's extreme four square.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.280]   Yeah, I think--
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.280]   It's like four square, yeah.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.840]   So, I'll say a little bit about it.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.840]   So basically, here's the deal.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.840]   It has to do the rumpest rooms, Patrick.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.840]   Yes.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.000]   You'll be a user pat.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.080]   We feel that when you talk about check-ins with four square, that's very much about
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.360]   getting you to a place and telling you where your friends are at.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.360]   Right.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.040]   But it doesn't actually get inside of the place.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.120]   And when you go on Yelp, it's, you know, to figure out what's good at a place, you have
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.920]   to read these really long multi-page reviews.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.280]   Many of you are written by people who have no idea what they're doing.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.280]   Beaker Milgan's hot.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.000]   Or they're really pissed off.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   Right.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.440]   So we want to make this process really lightweight and apply it more to the individual item.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:37.040]   And that it's really good at certain places and allow you to rank.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.560]   House is going to be different from whirl, which was sold out.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.880]   Whirl, and whrl.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:50.680]   And then dino, which is Jerry Young's startup, and then there's this one called forecast.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.600]   Everybody's been inviting me to where you tell people where you're going to be.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:57.200]   Yeah, it's not about-- It's not about-- it's not about-- it's not like yelling into a place.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.020]   It's kind of more like Yelp.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.020]   In a way.
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:01.020]   In a way.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.020]   What's wrong with Yelp?
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.020]   It's Angry Birds.
[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:04.020]   Yelp makes Angry Birds.
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.020]   Exactly.
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.020]   What?
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.020]   Oink.com.
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:08.020]   You'll see.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:09.700]   I'll actually come on your show and do a demo.
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.700]   Come back and do it.
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:11.700]   That would be great.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.700]   That would be great.
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.700]   That would be the first one to--
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.700]   That's exciting.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.700]   So this is the first milking product.
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:17.700]   So we'll be doing something new about every three to six months, and this is our first
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.700]   of a lap.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:19.700]   Can't wait.
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.180]   Patrick Norton is the host of Tekzilla T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.180]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.980]   Or as we ham say, say it with me, John.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.780]   Tango Echo Zulu.
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.580]   No, Tango Echo.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:31.580]   Zachary.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.580]   Tango.
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:36.580]   Every man.
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:38.580]   You pass your test.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.580]   Said.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:40.580]   We're bad hands.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:44.020]   In fact, I think we should make a show.
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.020]   Bad hands.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.020]   You know, you've always been a ham.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.020]   I know, but I have a piece of paper.
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:49.020]   Now you got a license.
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.020]   Bad hands.
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.020]   Bad hands.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.020]   We have a ham nation, so I think we can keep thinking.
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.020]   You got to go in.
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:55.020]   You got to go in.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.020]   You got to go in.
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:57.020]   Bad hands.
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:58.020]   You got to go in.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.020]   You got to go in.
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.020]   You got to go in.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:04.860]   Tango T-E-L-A.com and of course with the great Veronica Belmont, we could see that show on revision
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.860]   three every week.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.860]   And of course, the dailies too.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.860]   Yes.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:10.500]   You did a whole lion thing, Sonos.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.900]   Actually, we took a bar to Samsung.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:15.380]   Robert Herron and I took a bar to Samsung 8,000 last week.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.380]   That's fun.
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:17.380]   That's all of the layers and stuff.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:18.380]   Oh, that's really cool.
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.380]   That was fun.
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.380]   That's really cool.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.380]   Hey, how's that new Sonos?
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.380]   Did you check it out yet?
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:23.380]   Play three.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.380]   Awesome.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:25.380]   We just got one in the lobby if you want to listen.
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:26.380]   I haven't installed it yet.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.380]   Turn on the Sonos in the lobby.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:28.860]   Can you do that?
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:29.860]   This is so cool.
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.300]   Which I actually could probably do it from here.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.860]   So with the Sonos, we could turn it on.
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:37.780]   I have Sonos everywhere in the studio.
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.500]   Because it plays Twitter, you could play Twitter on it.
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:42.860]   So it's our universal Twitter interface.
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.220]   But you can also play Spotify on it and stuff like that.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:49.460]   Somebody unplugged the one in the lobby.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.620]   Oh, man.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.060]   And I was going to do a demo.
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.060]   Thank you, Patrick, for being here.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.060]   Thank you for having me.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.060]   It was fun.
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.060]   Couldn't do this with that.
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:58.060]   And devorant.com/blog.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:59.060]   No channel.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.060]   What?
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:01.060]   What?
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.060]   What?
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.060]   Oh, man.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:05.860]   See, this is why I have to drum it into everybody.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.700]   We should buy the dot com.
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:08.700]   How much is the dot com?
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:09.700]   I have the dot com.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:10.700]   I don't use it.
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:11.700]   What?
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:12.700]   How are you using the dot org then?
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:13.700]   You're not an organization.
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:14.700]   It's a long story.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.700]   I am an organization.
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.340]   He's non-profit.
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:20.340]   I'm not making any money, so it's non-profit, so I use dot org.
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.340]   It's because you got dot orgs and it's not com.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:26.540]   If you go to channeldevoract.com, you could find it all, including the No Agenda Show,
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.220]   and today's episode, Cut, Cap, Duck, and Cover.
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:30.220]   channeldevoract.org.
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:32.020]   Isn't that a dot com?
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.020]   No, brother.
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:35.700]   It's just dot org on the Don't Confuse People.
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.660]   Somebody did fix channeldevoract.com.com.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.660]   Who has dot net?
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:41.660]   You're a guy in Florida.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:42.660]   Really?
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.660]   Not the channel Devoract.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.660]   Somebody has channeldevoract.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:45.660]   No, nobody's got channeldevoract.
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:46.660]   What's right, sure, right now?
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.660]   That got it.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:49.660]   You guys are just confusing the public.
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:52.260]   Intentionally, I might add.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.260]   Just use dot com.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.500]   We'll all be happy, John.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.940]   The dot com has got it.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.740]   We're working on our special project for dot com.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:26:59.740]   Oh.
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:00.740]   Oh.
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:01.740]   Facebook killer.
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:02.740]   [laughter]
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.740]   Call the Winklevi.
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:05.740]   Thanks for being here, John.
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:06.740]   I really appreciate it.
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:07.740]   Always a pleasure.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:08.980]   Thanks to all of you for being here.
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:13.060]   Thank you for joining us for our very first episode from the Twit Brick House.
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:16.300]   We'll see you for many, many more to come.

[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.300]   [applause]
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.300]   Take care.
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:19.300]   [applause]
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.300]   See?
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:21.300]   [music]
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.300]   Do on the Twit.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.300]   All right.

[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:30.300]   All right.

[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.300]   All right.
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:35.300]   Do on the Twit.
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:36.300]   All right.
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.300]   Do on the Twit, baby.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:38.300]   Do on the Twit.
