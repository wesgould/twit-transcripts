[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.360]   We have a very fine panel assembled for you this week Dan Robino is here Daniel is a
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.880]   Writer of course at a Windows central executive editor. You don't even write anymore probably
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.000]   When I try to appear on TV and YouTube
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.560]   Lot easier and it looks like Daniel. You're carefully situated next to a hotel safe. So I'm
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:40.800]   Thinking you're probably already in Seattle for tomorrow's build conference. Yeah, I got here a day early beautiful weather in Seattle
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.720]   For once it's like really nice here. It's 60s 70s and it's sunny out. So it's gonna be a pretty exciting week
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.640]   Maybe maybe before the show admitted you said it's so boring. Yeah, Bill this year. I'm just not feeling it
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.400]   I'm sure there'll be some interesting announcements
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.920]   I mean there are some things we know about that are interesting and exciting but
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.400]   Obviously Microsoft is playing a different level these days compared to where like Google and Apple are so it's a little bit less
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.040]   Exciting to talk about say Azure and advance is there even if it's super important even if they make a ton of money
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.240]   I don't care. We're talking about a dupe whether you want to or not
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.280]   Data lakes
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:30.120]   Also with us and Pruitt he is drinking a fine centaurie whiskey this week contributing right at tech republic and don't forget his YouTube channel
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.120]   Ant Pruitt hello ant
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.240]   Hello mr. LaPorte. How you doing is it are you in between Clemson?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Seasons now you just can relax a little bit
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.960]   No, it's baseball season. Oh man. There's always something it's baseball season and we just signed the top
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.520]   Quarterback in the country for football. Well, there you go
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.960]   Yeah, I think I suspect that's correct. How do you know if a high school player is gonna be good? You don't know that
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.080]   Well, if you guess it Texas high school football isn't really high school football
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.040]   Right there are some California some states work. Yeah
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.600]   Look at our current quarterback from Georgia that won the national championship for us last year as a freshman
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.200]   He was rated number one pretty amazing as a freshman. Wow
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.480]   Getting younger and younger and a new contributor. We've seen her before on Tech News weekly
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.760]   Louise met sakas is here. She's a staff writer or wired you might remember her from motherboard. Hi, Louise
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.960]   Hey, what's up? How are you? You uh, your paris martinot was in exactly the same seat last week
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.640]   So, okay, I want to clarify she sits right there
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.560]   Here, okay, it's actually one and a half feet over there is a difference there is a difference. Yeah
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.120]   Louise covers uh
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   Security for wired, which is awesome
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.080]   Yeah, I'm technically a security reporter. Well and little teeny weeny phone show us that phone
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.720]   Yes teeny tiny phones
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.560]   That's so cute. That's so cute. It's so cute. It's a fake no kia 33 10
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.640]   Kind of a knock off
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.960]   You can see the little no kia logo. Your says no kia. You got it in hong kong. So it's uh, that's sort of counterfeit
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.160]   Sort of
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.640]   Yeah, I think that uh the us customs probably would not let you import one like this here
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.440]   But you can get one that has you know the cheapy
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.200]   Chinese logo on instead. Yeah, I actually I just I saw yours and I bought it. I saw your article about it
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   I bought it's $21
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.800]   Hell yeah, I'm trying to sort of trend everyone watching you should also get one
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.960]   I
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.440]   $21 is the size of your thumb
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.400]   Uh, yeah, oh, I can't wait to make phone calls on it and it just blow people's minds
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.640]   Does it have feel pretty I didn't ask and I should have before about it. Does it have snake on it?
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.120]   No, it doesn't have snake. I don't think I haven't uh some of them are different
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.880]   So mine has a voice changer, which is pretty fun. So it's like the
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.760]   Oh, this is always calling
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.560]   Exactly. So it's like the ultimate prank call machine
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.600]   For sure. So maybe yours will have that they kind of differ a little bit depending on like where you get it
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.320]   I think but the amazon one I think does have the voice changing capability. So have fun with that
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.360]   And I should warn you she calls this phone her son
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   Yeah, I think it's great
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.720]   And you guys as long as you don't carry him in a baby bjorn in front of you as you walk through brooklyn
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.080]   I think you're all right
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.720]   No, but I am trying to get him a keychain. I feel like that would be nice
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.440]   Oh, yeah, you could you could actually have him on your keychain
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.080]   Yeah, yeah, he has one of those little holes that you could remember back in the day with the flip phones or whatever where you could have like those little
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.400]   Key charms and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. He has a little slot for one of those. I want to see
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.920]   Yeah, I see at the bottom like a little string. That's hilarious. I should have prepared myself. It's probably you know
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   USB
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.360]   Tight the the old-fashioned micro USB charging. I bet you
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.720]   Yeah, it comes with a charging cord though. It doesn't come with the brick
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.440]   So you have to have like an iPhone brick to put the USB in but plenty of those lying around
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.680]   Yeah, yeah, we all have a brick or two. I did not throw out all my old USB micro USB cables
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.880]   Yeah, exactly. No
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.640]   Yeah, you have a use for it now. So let's see this week we have
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.280]   Build in fact, we're gonna cover that tomorrow. I have to get up at eight in the morning
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.160]   Bill Gates wouldn't have done that to me before it's a little early. Yeah starts today
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   Please get up before eight
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.120]   I have to get up at six or seven
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.880]   Takes me an hour to put on my makeup and fix my face and hair
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.760]   You're gonna see a whole different Leo on Monday morning
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:42.560]   Uh, so yeah, you can just camp out at the office there. Stay here. Why go home? Yeah, so uh
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.040]   Now the
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.520]   We debated this because Daniel you remember last year's build keynote
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.720]   Went for a world record three and a half hours
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.400]   So long they actually had a stretching session in the middle of it
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.560]   That's right, which I refuse to participate in on that that yeah
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.320]   Didn't they bring like a yoga person out and she showed people what to do
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.960]   You know it was awkward. It was a little weird
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.720]   I don't know what what they're doing with these key notes tomorrow is gonna be a little strange too. They have three of them
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.080]   technically
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.920]   Uh, so there's the main one which is such in the delas vision keynote. That's
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.680]   What I would say is the exciting one, but oh, that's a bad sign
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.040]   Exciting one
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:31.760]   Vision stuff comes in right and we'll see you some of the more interesting announcements unless you're really really into scott
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:38.960]   Gertrines azure server stuff, which is super important. I don't want to knock it down. It's just the one I usually pass on
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.360]   But yeah, it's gonna be you know the interesting morning. So it's gonna be
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.320]   Apparently because satya nadella's vision thing is sometimes a little
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.600]   Up in the clouds they brought in ball throughout marriage of falling to explain it afterwards
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.640]   They're gonna do a post keynote kind of explainer
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.200]   Uh, we will carry that and then we'll do windows weekly shortly after that
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.400]   Is it three or one? I I've gotten conflicting reports
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.440]   But it will as far as I know right now. It's three o'clock three so on the schedule of three p.m. Pacific's
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   eastern
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.160]   What is there anything? Go ahead
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:24.320]   Yeah, does this mean that the developer conferences are starting to go back to being developer conferences instead of shows?
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.040]   I would actually say that started about two years ago
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.720]   Uh, in fact like the last big build that was really sort of like exciting
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.680]   It was probably 2015 they gave out xbox as to everybody that showed up and those back when they were
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.200]   very much tying things into device launches and
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Software for those and these the conference now is much more professional
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.600]   Aim that just pure developer news and that's why it's gone from where they would get on stage
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.120]   I'm even announced like years ago like alumia phone on stage, right?
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:59.520]   And obviously if not doing that anymore, but it's now much more focused just on software tools for the people who are paying
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:06.560]   What is the substantial amount of money to attend a developer conference and not get distracted by flashy more consumer news?
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   Which they tend to now say for separate events and with google i/o right around the corner obviously on Tuesday
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.440]   Whatever major news they make that would be consumer or pop culture-ish
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:24.240]   Would quickly wane by within 24 hours because of google so I think they're it's actually smart to keep the conference like this
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.560]   But it makes it a little bit less interesting if you you know, I have been following these for a few years now
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   You do have to give a give such a lot of credit though. Microsoft
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.840]   Joined the trillion dollar club this month. Yeah, did you see that uh that bloomberg cover with that crazy font?
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.440]   No, yeah
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.200]   Yeah, so the cover of bloomberg this week is uh how he saved the you know saved microsoft
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.280]   And it's this really insane like 90s
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.960]   font
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.520]   Uh, what did you think do you think he's really turned around the company?
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   Yeah, I mean ends now. Yeah, oh god. Look at that. That's his story. The dallas onts is that the miracle of microsoft
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.920]   It looks like a detergent box. Yeah, right like a
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.600]   It's a great. It's like a pepto bizball font
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.800]   No guys guys what it is is it's those like cupcakes
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.920]   You know what I mean? Like it looks like a like a like a cupcake
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.240]   You'd get it like a gas station or something and because the sun is coming up over his dome
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.880]   You want to go?
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.240]   It's very such as in the clouds
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.680]   Uh, yeah that great font it's yellow with
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:39.680]   A pink outline the miracle of microsoft and then a very kind of 90s the greatest tech company of the 90s is back
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.560]   That's a that is a brilliant cover
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.520]   Yeah, yeah, I mean perfect timing for
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.320]   For build. Yeah, I love that. It is a miracle. It's a miracle
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.920]   I mean microsoft was so dull their stock was flat for a decade. I mean
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.440]   You could drive on it. It was so flat. Yeah
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:06.720]   Now they're doing really really well. I mean, it's it's not the same exciting stuff on the ball mar era and ball mar himself was always an
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.480]   entertaining person
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.960]   Whether interviews when the dollar is definitely a lot more restrained I would say but if you hold microsoft stock
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:19.600]   An entertaining CEO is number one on the list of things you want. Yeah ask anyone who has Tesla stock, right?
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.960]   Yeah, right. Yeah
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.440]   So, but I mean I think the changes he's done. I obviously I'm not super happy
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.480]   You know, I wish things with like phone everything. Well, you work for a
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.680]   publication called windows central
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.280]   Yeah, and it's one thing such it definitely did and I think I you commend him for it is really
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.600]   It when he arrived windows and office were everything they were the cash cow. They drove the company
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.080]   He wisely I think saw that desktop operating systems were not the future that the cloud was the future
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.560]   And he pivoted that company
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.280]   And thank god he did because if windows were still their fortune, it wouldn't be a very good
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.280]   Story to tell
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   Yeah, and unfortunately that change probably should happen years ago. I mean back in 2007
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   They missed mobile. I mean they were doing mobile and they were actually had a head start in mobile
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.840]   But as a company they were focused on desktop and we're completely ignoring where everything was going
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.480]   The company now is positioned in a much more forward leaning towards, you know
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.240]   Looking forward to future to lack in the next 10 years where computing is going to be and trying to get their head of everybody else
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.400]   That's why it's so much focus on AI machine learning
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.680]   HoloLens and these kind of technologies which as consumers we hear near various esoteric words
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.760]   And we're only starting now to see little bits of the stuff trickle into real world life
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:40.480]   But obviously they're betting that you know in 10 15 years is how tech is going to be and I think they're totally right on that so I agree
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.520]   Yeah
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.040]   But it's yeah, it's a little bit less exciting at least initially, but it's important stuff
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.280]   No, and you know what people like us
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.880]   Are not don't do enterprise for a reason right?
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.440]   Isn't the most exciting thing ever consumer technology? I like consumer technology
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.920]   But get you know get me get me stories about azure and hadoop and data lakes and
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.040]   You know, I'm out and which is good. It's good. We have mary joe folio. No, it's weekly because
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.960]   She's yeah, she loves it stuff. She seems to care about that stuff where else she's a very good actor
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:17.040]   Yeah, uh, but let me ask is it really so one of the reasons tech stocks are been going up
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.680]   Is because after the tax cut
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.680]   Companies like apple have been buying back stock like crazy
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.440]   That's what they're doing with their repatriated money and some say that's artificially pushing up these tech stocks
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.480]   Do you think?
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.080]   Microsoft's value true value has gone up by that much
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.200]   Or is it a shell game a little bit?
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.320]   Yeah, I mean i'm obviously not a financial person per se so uh, but from what I understand
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.960]   Their evaluation seems to be well within the range of being kind of conservative
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.960]   I think because everybody looks at their profits and the cloud computing area
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.280]   Which is just known to be a growth area
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.600]   There's not a ton of competition though the competition there with amazon and google
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.360]   I would say significant and obviously major players, but they seem to have a firm grasp and vision where they're going so
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.360]   Uh, it just seems like
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.760]   It's betting on a future business that seems to be doing well
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.000]   And the company itself is very conservative
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.480]   I would say in terms of how it approaches new problems or products and makes it a little bit safer to invest in
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.080]   But yeah, this stock buyback thing is always an interesting angle
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.720]   These companies are sitting on a ton of money these days
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:29.360]   And so it's we're entering a new era of this like massive hyper capitalism with some of these companies hitting over 1 trillion
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:36.320]   Dollars, you know making 30 billion in revenue per quarter. It's uh, it's it's kind of a new level. Yeah, it's kind of amazing
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.000]   So yeah
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.720]   Well, I mean if you thought that the margins were nice on advertising the margins are crazy on cloud computing
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.880]   And I think that's a big thing is that they're just making you know
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.160]   There's not a lot that they have to really do to make a lot of money on that
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.920]   And I think microsoft's also done an amazing job staying out of the sh that uh companies like
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.520]   Facebook
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.360]   Amazon google have gotten themselves into except for like the github acquisition
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.160]   Which she was like a little bit of drama like they really, you know, stay pretty well outside of
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.760]   A lot of the issues that play a lot of these other companies like they want facial recognition to be regulated
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.000]   You know that sort of thing. I think brad's really great
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.600]   Yeah, so we're just joking about that before how like microsoft doesn't have this
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:24.000]   And we'll talk about it in your show notes for youtube regarding like some their changes that are coming up like youtube now has this problem of like
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.480]   We help contribute evidently to the outbreak of measles
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.240]   Coming back like that's a terrible headline and news story to be associated with as google and youtube that microsoft
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.960]   Thankfully to this point has done how to story like that they could at any moment, right?
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.200]   That's the business we're in so we can't put them too high on a pedestal, but so far
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.160]   Uh, yeah, I mean absolutely right that the last few years
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.840]   It's been facebook and google taking the brunt of all this privacy stuff and uh, you know, it's worked in microsoft's favor
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.000]   well, but that's what's interesting because
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.160]   If you asked somebody a couple of years ago
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.080]   Is microsoft a privacy focused company they would say hell no look at windows 10 and all it took telemetry
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.160]   It sends back that you can't turn off
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.360]   Uh, but somehow without doing much it seems
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.240]   Microsoft has started to look more like I guess in the comparison to facebook and google
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.760]   A privacy focused company they're closer to apple right apple. I haven't like apple
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.520]   They haven't chit you know, they haven't taken the flag of privacy and planted and said this is us or have them
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.720]   They have a little bit, but they're definitely in between I would say apple and google in terms of privacy
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.600]   They're not quite as you know good as I would say apple
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.320]   But they're also different business models too, but obviously google
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.000]   I was just in we'll talk about the numbers later of google, but like I was blowing away that
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.920]   They made 36 billion in revenue 30 billion of that was advertising
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:46.960]   Like if you ever need to know what google's business is like that's a pretty clear sign versus what mark itself's businesses and so
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.360]   Microsoft does do advertise bing is an advertising
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.920]   Yeah company and they acquired
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:59.360]   Overture right which they wrote off as a flop, but they they wanted this is almost just luck for amazon for apple and microsoft
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.680]   both had ads
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.120]   They work both pursuing ad tech and in both cases it failed
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.840]   And whole hallelujah, we don't care anymore. We did that was a good thing, right?
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.080]   Yeah, it's a tough business. Obviously google was sweeping up everybody, but
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.960]   Yeah, there are numbers this quarter. Obviously weren't great
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.560]   I still also find that funny too. They're numbers that they only did said they had a 17% improvement for advertising and
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.160]   Evidently that's not good enough for wall free. It's like because it used to be like 22% so clearly there's a problem
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.560]   By get it. There's a slowdown in advertising and when that much of your business is advertising. It's
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.920]   Yeah, I'm best at doing this. Yeah, I love this is kirin mccarthy writing in the register
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.960]   Of course, you know, they're the kings of snark, but I love his choice clip art
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:48.480]   Microsoft promises to boil down its lengthy and confusing privacy controls in a 1500 word announcement
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.080]   And there's 1350 or okay
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.440]   All right, yeah
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.520]   1360
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.480]   So what is what is Microsoft's commitment to privacy? Are they genuinely?
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.600]   About that. I mean they do
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:13.120]   It often seems like the stuff they send back from windows is just telemetry giving them information about what people are doing with windows
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.120]   Not so much trying to track you
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.680]   Yeah, the difference is so there's information right and that's all we're talking about here is the information
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.560]   What are they doing with that information? Are they then selling to third parties? Are they themselves monetizing it?
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.440]   Uh, they're not a hundred percent not doing that right?
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.840]   So if you look at outlook outlook service of ads if you're not a paying subscriber to office
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.040]   Uh, and so and of course being in search has you know service ads for search results
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.800]   So there are there are some elements there, but when it comes to windows 10 collecting telemetry
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:48.160]   It's not tied to it not tied to your accountant in an identifiable way that can be used to track your behavior
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.800]   It is purely meant on a technical basis for them to help improve the product versus
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.360]   Profile you and then use that profile then sell off to advertisers
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.120]   Which many would I would say argue that google and facebook do look at you as the sort of the the target
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.000]   Um, and so mics have has always been doing that middle ground like I said between apple and google
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.320]   And finding the space between advertising and privacy, but as a flay, you know, luis mentioned this earlier about
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:21.600]   Facial scans and that kind of data. They're pushing that to be regulated by governments this idea of biometrics
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.760]   Having regulation I think is an interesting one and important one because so many things now scan our faces and data points
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.840]   It's like all right. Where's that information get stored?
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.320]   You know jet blue recently in boston where I am
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.440]   Started facial scans instead of boarding passes
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.760]   Well, that shocked people when they did that didn't that yeah
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.560]   Because then it was like wait, where are they getting the information from in terms?
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   Oh, there we have a database and it's the government has it and they're working with the government on this
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.560]   There was just they got a little like weird
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   No one signed off on that, you know
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.680]   Right, right? We're like you can opt out you can opt out and we were like yeah, but we want to opt in
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.720]   How this should be it came out of a tweet as I remember somebody tweeted this was weird
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.000]   I just boarded a jet blue plane and I didn't have to show my d they knew who I was from my face
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.280]   And it turns out it's a dhs database and that jet blue doesn't get access to it
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.440]   And jeff blue was like jeff blue was like oh, don't worry karen you can opt out
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.520]   It was like what but
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:24.000]   But yeah, I mean, I think there's a there's a big difference between say amazon who releases these like horrible blog posts where they're like
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.720]   Oh, we don't we think that like facial recognition's fine. Like here's our really weird like 1500 word statement on it versus
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.600]   The president of microsoft, you know giving a speech in paris about the importance of data and
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:41.200]   Writing op-eds about how facial recognition should be regulated. I think is like a really stark contrast
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.720]   So they've done a good job at least from a public relations standpoint of
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.720]   Trying to position themselves as a leader. Yeah, that's where I get squirrely because
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:55.760]   Do they do a good job of being a leader or just a good job of public relations?
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.120]   I think it's a little bit of both obviously they're facing a little more scrutiny right now in europe due to the heavier regulation
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.320]   There with telemetry and data collection and being upfront about it
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:11.360]   And it does force them to be you know reconsider and that's what sort of this letter was in response to about how they're going to respond to that
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.280]   And be a little bit more clear. I find their privacy controls to be pretty good
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.680]   You can just go through their website and turn everything on and off and everybody's kind of doing this now
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.520]   But yeah, they've just never been as sort of creepy about their technology
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.960]   Which is funny too because if you think about it years ago, they launched the xbox one
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.240]   And it had the connect camera and everybody was freaking out there
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.960]   I don't want to put a camera with microphones on my living room. Were you nuts?
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.520]   And and now today
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.080]   By a tv. Yeah, you don't have to do it. They'll do it for you and it goes to show you this
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.880]   Overton window right how things have just shifted over now
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.840]   We're putting cameras in our bedroom and hoping that amazon's
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.760]   Only occasionally recording and saving the audio that amazon employees may or may not be listening to which is like
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.120]   So different meanwhile maryks I was like yeah, no more connect. So it's like I don't know everything shifting around
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:03.600]   It's uh very strange times. I think we're definitely trying to balance between there are definitely people who really care about privacy and they
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.640]   You know make it a point to buy products that have it then there's just a lot of people just don't care
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.600]   Right. I'm still amazed by the facebook, you know, how many people
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.960]   Yeah, they don't care. No, so but louise you cover security maybe
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.600]   Microsoft's
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:27.200]   Problem is not going to be privacy so much as security. Uh, we just heard another problem with uh 1903
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.480]   Um, you know, which is the the version that they're going to about to push push out
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.400]   They are pushing out in some cases
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:41.920]   It seems like microsoft can't seem to write software or at least they can't update windows twice a year as they've promised to without all sorts of issues
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:47.360]   And now it was 1803 then it was 1809 now. It's 1903 all have had big problems
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.840]   Yeah, the amount of issues in uh, microsoft is crazy
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.280]   Like there's there's just constantly like way more bugs than there should be and they can't seem to get their act together on that
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.880]   And it's just routine at this point like it's not even that interesting
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.920]   When these bugs come up because they are so frequent
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.960]   Um, I think if you're really concerned, you know from a privacy standpoint, you probably shouldn't be
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.600]   Using word or like they're just certain programs that I don't think are are great
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.200]   Uh, but yeah, I mean, I think that you know all software has these kinds of issues
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.400]   But it is interesting that you know windows continues to stumble
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.120]   Uh with these problems over and over again. Yeah, I continue to hear so much beef about windows 10 and
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.800]   Personally, I can't say that I have those issues because
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:39.520]   About 90 percent of the time i'm staring at an app not necessarily staring at the living in adobe world
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:48.400]   Either adobe or a terminal or it's a terminal cdos getting in the way are you using mac or using windows
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:55.680]   No, no, no, I use windows, but when i'm not doing creative stuff i'm staring at some old informant databases
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.480]   Geez louise. I'm so sorry
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   My god
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:07.680]   Really, really you know, I I handled all of this issue by wiping I bought a new think pad x1 extreme
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.400]   Love it, but I finally just wipe windows off
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.800]   Oh, how dare you?
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.680]   There really is the only real way to use a computer honestly
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.360]   I've struggled with windows and the only thing is I don't have the adobe universe
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:25.200]   But i'm actually quite impressed by the range of desktop software for licks even for photo editing in fact in some ways it's
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.680]   It's it's more powerful. It is pretty competitive on an exciting. Yeah, i'm using
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.640]   A poorly named but very good program called raw therapy with two e's
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.880]   Lina, what is this? Where did you get this?
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.560]   It was on the internet i downloaded it's great i love it
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.400]   No, i'm using so here. Yeah, i'm so uh
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.600]   Are you making some memes? What are you doing? No, no, no i'm doing for fair because i like to take pictures
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.760]   Although i my our photographer friend uh chris mark work made me swear not to take pictures for the next two weeks
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.840]   Because i was complaining that i was kind of in a
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.000]   Dold rooms and he said okay, you can't take any pictures for two weeks i said no no i want to now
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.440]   But anyway, uh, but this this camera imports very nicely into the linux that think pad has an sd card slot
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.960]   I use g thumb to import it. It looks just like light room when it's importing
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.920]   Does the same organizational things i use raw therapy or dark table actually raw therapy is my new
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.240]   Fave and it does all the editing i want to do it's great and i use the light dark table dark table is pretty good
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.360]   Uh, it's fine and raw therapy looks even better. It's very interesting both are non destructive
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.440]   Uh, honestly adobe's hold on this market is gonna is gonna get
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.240]   A little shaky especially as they're moving towards more and more towards forcing you to subscribe
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.680]   I was so peeved that they you know i have to buy a terabyte of storage to upload my photos to adobe
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.920]   I don't want to upload my photos to adobe
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.880]   But you don't have to you're not forced to do that. No, but it's like i'm paying for it
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:59.840]   Right, it's part of how you're part of the deal. You can't not pay for it. You can't take that out of your subscription
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.480]   I know i think it's a different standpoint because i i use the whole suite
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.320]   You know i never think about using the ten dollar photo thing which is photoshop and light room and actually that's ten
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.360]   Dollars a month pretty good price for that. But i figured you are paying for storage. That's right
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.400]   That does require the storage on that package
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.960]   Anyway, i'm happier with lemmex to be honest with you
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:28.080]   But you're using a surface studio in front of you. Yeah, well, I haven't put lemmex on this yet
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.760]   But it might just be a matter of time
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.160]   How many like
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:41.600]   Artists do we really think are drawing on those like that was the whole thing when when that was released is that all the ads were like that color wheel thing
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.240]   And there was gonna be everyone was gonna be painting. Oh, there you go. There you go. I have my knob
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   Well, I never use it. By the way
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:54.480]   You caught me. I'm looking at a listing on alie bobba for the nokia 33 10 the real one
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.480]   14 dollars
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:01.200]   Pretty good pretty good. It's gonna take probably six weeks to get to you from alie bobba though. That's fine and it may work
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:08.480]   Apparently free shipping the united states via the netherlands. I don't understand that at all estimated delivery time 33 days
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.280]   That's one of the things i love about alie bobba. So does it say 18 months, you know, it's crazy
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.080]   Uh, but for 15 dollars now I can have a big one and a little one. I can have a matching set
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.920]   We oh, I love that or I could pretend my son is growing up
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.200]   Exactly
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.760]   Louise if if I had one of those surface
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.720]   Studios like he has there I would I would definitely use it. I have a
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:40.480]   Cintiq over here. This is like a cintiq. Yeah, right? It would be totally useful for me
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.240]   I'm not an illustrator, but I do use a cintiq to edit photos a lot actually here's where microsoft
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.200]   Oddly went wrong with this. I think their surface line is pretty cool. This is very expensive
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.000]   It's $3,000 because you have this 30 inch touch screen, which is awesome
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.320]   I mean it's for what i'm doing and for an artist we brought in a an illustrator
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.600]   Uh and let her play with it when it first came out. She was she fell in love with it
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.960]   She loved it. She used the knob and all that stuff, but
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   uh, dial surface
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.200]   But uh
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.800]   The sad thing is they have this great screen and then I guess to save money
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.160]   They basically put the the power of the
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:26.080]   Computer is terrible. It's basically like a bad laptop. We actually upgraded it a little bit
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.200]   But are you on surface studio one or two one is too better? Yeah, yeah two is significantly better
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.720]   So the processor is still roughly the same of 45 watt. So it's still technically a mobile processor
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.680]   Yeah, but now it has a gtx what 1060 in it. Oh, okay. That that would help
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.600]   Yeah, that's a
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.800]   And we were placed it had slow 5400 rpm spinning. Yeah, so we replaced that with ssd's
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.480]   You know we we souped it up a little bit, but uh, honestly
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.040]   Ssd slows it down. I mean the hard drive slowed it down
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:55.680]   It's terrible
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.920]   But the new one is just ssd is the only option and it's the prophraiben. That's what i use
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.600]   I use a surface studio. Oh you do? Yeah, and it's it's been perfect. There's been no slowdowns
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.560]   Do you draw? What are you doing with it? No, no, I I use it as a pretty much a normal computer
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.320]   They occasionally have to sign a document so you have it in the all-in-one
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.120]   You have it upright last. Yep
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.680]   This is made for video podcasts because it's you know at a low angle and it's
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.600]   Yeah, three by two aspects and I have the pen and what is it dial? I never use but I got them
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.240]   Yeah, I could actually you know what I do with it
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.160]   I do do this because this is really awesome
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.280]   I can let me just find something here we go. Let's let's zoom in on this
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:44.240]   And then uh if I double tap the top it turns it into an image that I can then illustrate
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.440]   Oh, that's fun. I love that. Yeah, actually I use this feature all the time. This is one of my
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.200]   therapy
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.880]   All right
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.880]   Now how much would you pay?
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.120]   Totally worth $3,000
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.880]   Totally worth $3,000
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.840]   So that I could draw a mustache and such a novella floating in the clouds
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   Uh, let's take a little uh time out and we will continue what a great panel
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.680]   It's so nice to meet you, luise
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.400]   I've been a fan of your writing for so long both at motherboard and now at wire and i'm just thrilled to have you on the show
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.440]   Thank you
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.000]   Taking some of the I appreciate that. Do you need to get home for a game of thrones or anything? I mean
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.040]   No, I'm not a game of thrones fan actually
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.160]   So no, I'm not a game of thrones fan. So I have I have nowhere to be uh after this shocking
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:34.240]   Because you know, I know if you told me I got to get home. I could make the show shorter because we don't want anybody to miss
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.200]   Anything exciting. Please lie to him. Please lie to him
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.920]   Somebody else might want to get home
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:46.000]   Carse. Yeah, I need to go watch to the the game of thrones pre-party whatever people do before game of thrones. I need to do that
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.680]   Yeah, yeah, so you're really wasted by the time it comes on and you don't know who's that what's going on?
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.400]   Who are they why do he just killed what?
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   I will say I will say I went to a game of thrones party maybe two weeks ago and I I don't think they were speaking english
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.080]   I don't know how you watch that show without the subtitles on because like it's barely in english
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.640]   Like maybe if you've been in that world for years, but like
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:14.720]   It's not that of course I had no idea what the plot was but I like and everyone has a very strange name
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.840]   I just think it would be such a barrier of entry even if I started the beginning to like care about all that. Yes
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.160]   Well, if you really cared you'd read all the books first
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:31.040]   Create a family tree. Perhaps go to the game of thrones wiki so you could keep up on all the
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:38.160]   different plot subplot and uh interplot lines and uh, I think it'd be a trivial it'd be easy to follow
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.480]   Right just a couple weeks that have turned on the subtitles, which is what I do
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.760]   Yeah, and here you got to do that. Yeah, prue it is also here
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.920]   writer at tech republic youtube.com/ant prue it are you doing the friday night uh video editing things
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.600]   I've switched switched off from doing nose
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:01.760]   But I'll do a couple other live streams here and there just the sort of pop in while i'm in the middle of just a random project
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.280]   It's been pretty fun showing people how you work with informics databases or what
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:10.080]   Every now and then I show some folks vi really
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.280]   Nice
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.760]   Very fancy. I don't watch game of thrones, but I do have some banana pudding that I made
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.080]   I want to get to just so you know
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:27.200]   Do you like to eat it while it's hot is that why oh no no no it's chilling now
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.640]   I put it in a refrigerator before I um came on there with you. How do you know an elephant's in your refrigerator?
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.600]   The footprints in the banana pudding
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.760]   Dan
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.760]   Yes, I'm a dad. Daniel
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.560]   executive editor windows central he is getting ready for the big festival week for
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.320]   For people who cover microsoft the build conference
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.800]   So great. You got there day early you're getting ready. It's very exciting
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.560]   We have our influencer party tonight. So I don't think game of thrones. I'll be hanging out with other
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.520]   Microsoft nerds who's an influencer in your yeah, what's a microsoft influencer?
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:11.120]   Yeah, I know I do straddle the line apparently between media and influencer. Oh nice
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.040]   So this is a party thrown by microsoft for influencers
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.760]   For in media too. Yeah, so it's a lot of the press people we just get together
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.280]   It's uh, yeah, it seems so contrary to I my understanding of influencers people on instagram
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.160]   We have a million followers and they're tweeting about tea
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.480]   Yeah, it's not so much for those people. Yeah, it's not like a lot of youtube stars
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.280]   Microsoft's I could do the fire festival part two or something
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.800]   Yeah, I think they just sort of lump media and air buy together into one category anyone who has a voice
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.600]   Out there. So that's cool. I'd like to see that. I'd like to go there
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.480]   As influencers actually understand object-oriented programming like that, right? Yeah
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.960]   All right, we'll be back a lot more to talk about including google.io, which is
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:35:00.320]   The next day. I it's I wish these guys they did it twice last year that it too. I wish they could figure out how to
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.960]   Separate the developer conferences a little bit
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:08.640]   But let's talk a little bit about thousand eyes now. This is something that if you are in a business
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.880]   Where you have network operations you have customers in the cloud you have to deliver
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.440]   Or you have to receive you have to
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.520]   You know that there's one of the biggest challenges of this is and there's a good reason
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.080]   Why they draw the cloud is a puffy little cloud things go in
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:33.440]   Maybe they come out. Maybe they don't maybe they take a long time and it's really hard to see what's going on in there
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.040]   It could be very
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:44.560]   Frustrating clouds great for business, but as you gain that agility you also increase risk and most importantly for dev ops and and it guys you lose control
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.120]   When your cloud app or your service goes down do you even know what wrong you just go?
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.680]   It's the cloud. It's in the cloud somewhere
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.560]   As you scramble to find the cause of the problem trying to fix it you're losing revenue
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:02.000]   Employee productivity goes down. Maybe even you're damaging your brand. You know how what a big deal it is
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.480]   When a cloud provider goes down, that's a big deal you need instant visibility
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.880]   Into the entire service delivery path from the cloud to your end user
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.160]   And most especially including the portions you don't own or control
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.480]   And that's what thousand eyes does they really should call it a million eyes
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.800]   There is this is this this is an amazing service unlike anything you've ever seen before
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.960]   And it came out of research from some years ago
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.240]   Graduate students who were trying to figure out how do you how do you solve this problem?
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.320]   They put sensors a massive array of vantage points all over the global internet cloud providers
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.200]   Even down to the Wi-Fi in your local coffee shop
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:54.080]   Thousand eyes is a cloud based program built to help organizations do the cloud right their unique path visualization technology extends beyond boundaries
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.800]   Allowing you to see understand and improve the experience for all your apps
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.760]   All your services all your websites
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.800]   It's it's almost as if you're sitting there trying to peer through
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.600]   a you know a kind of a
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.720]   Strict dirty you know window and somebody comes along with a squeegee
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.760]   and and you can see
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.840]   Uh moheelad who's the founder and the Ricardo Oliveira
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:29.920]   We're doing research at the ucla internet research lab. They were trying to visualize autonomous system topologies got an nsf grant
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:36.480]   Then they said, you know this is something that the internet needs and they created thousand eyes and I got to tell you this is
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.200]   an eye opener
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:46.960]   squeegee that view of the world clean join the top banks the enterprises the sass companies the world's largest and fastest growing brands who rely on
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.040]   Thousand eyes to do the cloud and do it right
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.920]   Here's what you do you want to find out more go to thousand eyes dot com slash twit
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.160]   And see what you've been missing. They've got an e-book there that you could provide the boss
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.400]   Five cloud migration challenges you shouldn't ignore lots of things to think about before you move to the cloud
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.680]   If the cloud's important to you whether it's right now or in the future thousand eyes dot com slash twit
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   And we appreciate you using that URL that lets them know you heard it here

[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:30.400]   Okay, let's see where do we go from here? Let's talk about because this was so next week's developer week
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   Uh last week was quarterly results week, although
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.920]   Facebook threw in a developer conference last week to f8
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.720]   The did you know the futures private?
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:48.000]   You know mark could say that over and over again he can even stand at or a giant sign that says the futures private somehow
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   I don't know if I believe him
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.400]   Yeah, I don't think anyone does I think that's probably part of the problem
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.160]   I kind of respect the idea that you're trying to turn this around, but it's
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:06.000]   I just Facebook's one of those things. I'm not a fan. I never I've never been a hardcore facebook user. I stopped
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.960]   I barely use it for about six months for a high school reunion that I stopped using it and
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:17.280]   Opted out of it and that was about it. Um, I also there's a point in your life where all your friends are married and have kids
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.640]   And you're not part of that crowd and it gets really weird on facebook
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.720]   But i'm just not into the whole thing
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.360]   Feeling bad for you. That's kind of yes
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.560]   It's a choice. It's a choice
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.560]   But like I and that's unfortunate because I do understand the social nature of facebook
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.240]   People want to stay connected and it seems like such a lost opportunity that this
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.360]   What was potentially a huge idea is just getting so sour with all these controversies
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:50.000]   So excited when mark wrote that blog post that I actually I had killed my facebook account
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.200]   I reactivated it and then I got talked down
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:59.360]   People said wait a minute and actually at f8 he reiterated all these important things were going to be private
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.840]   We're going to have end-end encryption wait till you see it and they announced nothing
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.480]   They made zero changes
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.760]   Louise is is it do you?
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.960]   Am I wrong in thinking that mark is full of it?
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.800]   Uh, I think like he is kind of full of it
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.680]   But I think that there what the problem is facebook is grappling with this fundamental problem
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:28.480]   Is that there was a time when you added everyone you you knew to facebook right and now it's been too long
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.000]   I've had facebook for over a decade
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.760]   So now it's everyone i've ever met in the last decade and there's like nothing that's reasonable to share with all of those people at once
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.640]   Right like we don't really know what to do anymore like when I was a heavy facebook user. That's an interesting problem
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.640]   I hadn't even thought of that
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.800]   Like that's the issue is that like why would you want to share with all these people you know have kids now that you don't really talk
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.880]   To wear that like it's just photos of their kids like and I think it's true for younger people too like
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:59.680]   No one wants to share everything with their second cousin and some guy who was in their english class freshman europe college
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.320]   Like that doesn't really make sense and the only way to fix that I think is to go private
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.880]   So I think that mark is addressing a genuine issue and I think it's not just the privacy scandals
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:14.560]   It's that like you said it's perfect for a high school reunion or a college reunion or something because it's essentially a scrapbook
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.840]   It's not really a live network anymore. I think for a lot of people in north america, especially and I think that
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.160]   Yeah, people like group chats people like one-on-one chats. That's not going to go away
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.320]   But like this weird
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.160]   You know memory book is like super eerie and strange for a lot of people now
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.280]   I mean, I think it's like what in a couple decades is going to be more dead people than
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.240]   Live people on facebook and that's gonna be really weird
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.000]   The oxford internet institute predicted that based on 2018 user levels
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.880]   The dead will outnumber the living on facebook by 2070
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.720]   That's why I will be one of them. I'm just saying no
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.360]   That is a weird number and a weird statistic
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:03.120]   But you raised a more interesting point which is that basically you and daniel have both kind of outgrown facebook that facebook
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:09.120]   Served a purpose for you at one time, but there was no easy way to take facebook with you into your modern life
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:14.000]   Well, it's still offensive to unfriend someone right like there's no you can mute them
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.480]   But like there's not like a path to like i haven't spoken to you in six years. I'm just gonna delete you
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:24.080]   Like that's not we don't really have like, you know, we don't like that's still kind of weird and it's like oh, I hope they don't notice
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   So why wouldn't you do this? You just you don't want to hurt anybody's feelings
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.560]   It's just like not socially acceptable like we don't have the like normal social
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.640]   You know contract like we already had the normal contract for the positive side
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.520]   Which is like okay? You become friends with somebody maybe like after you hang out once or twice you add them on facebook
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.880]   But we have never decided what you do in six years when like you haven't talked to them in five years and you don't
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.520]   You know you have no way to say bye
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.800]   So they never call someone to tell them you're going to stop talking to them
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.720]   Yeah, you don't just ghost them
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:02.720]   You just ghost them right so this is a problem. It sounds like you there's so the one of facebook's problem is no one under 25 uses at all
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.800]   The next problem apparently is there's a generation that did use it
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.360]   But now feels like it doesn't have any meaning in their life
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.560]   In fact totally the big problem with facebook is it's mostly all people like me. They're using it
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.760]   Oh, yeah, like they just released this new
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.400]   Thing called secret crush where it's going to be in countries where there's facebook dating
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.680]   Yeah, so basically what you can say is like you can say
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.960]   Uh, you have a crush on louise and then if I put you on my crush list then we're like matched together
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.440]   And when this came out
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.200]   Yeah, so it's horrible and if you don't put the same person on your list
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.560]   Then you just like know that somebody had a crush on you, but you don't know who it is
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.040]   It's kind of like tender though. Isn't that a little tindry?
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:48.960]   Yeah, yeah, it's kind of tindry except like it's so facebook. It's like they get jealous of some other
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.360]   Product or company so they oh what we can do that and then they don't do it right
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:58.400]   Yeah, but what I thought was interesting about this is that everyone saw it and they were like oh my god
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:03.520]   Like teens like the teens are gonna love this and it's like no I think that boomers are gonna love this
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.680]   I really think that's who's gonna be using it
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:11.280]   Like it's not gonna be teens like why would you that'd be so awkward if you have better better ways to do it
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.680]   They have snapchat they have other techniques that are better. They're on tick-tock like they're not on facebook
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.560]   Yeah
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.520]   And I think it's cool. Yeah, they don't have a trouble meeting people so much
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.760]   I mean, I think older adults do because we're like wrapped up in jobs and we don't get out
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.240]   So it's you don't have that social stuff
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:32.240]   I just get sort of my fundamental problems or with just venture capitalism and these companies
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.320]   In general, which is facebook and for tree was one of those companies started off
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.480]   Like I said that is a really good idea for keeping people connected, but that was never enough right?
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.080]   So as soon as these companies start taking venture capital money, it's all about growth
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.160]   They had to constantly be growing at exponential rates forever
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:52.240]   And that means you have to constantly be innovating and creating new things
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.440]   And sometimes a facebook could be just facebook, right?
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:00.000]   It could just be this basic chat thing like how we all yearn for the days of aim
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.320]   Um, but they don't have that luxury. They have to always keep adding more stuff
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.200]   They they went down that path of advertising years ago. We heard that you know media was dead
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.720]   It's all gonna be facebook publishing
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:16.160]   So they've gone away from their roots of what it was supposed to be with this and in this point about
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.840]   Not sharing certain things with like, you know college people versus a friend versus your co-workers
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.760]   It's totally accurate. It's a really good, you know point that what we share now
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.200]   It just has very different audiences and there's no way to segregate that now
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.920]   So is there something gonna come along to displace it? That's a problem. Nothing has
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.680]   Why not
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.200]   Why is it some smart techie out there saying I got better idea why I could make something new
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.360]   The hooks are way too big, you know that to to have somebody just come in and push them out
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.000]   If anybody can attempt to push them out, but it's hope you have to be where all your friends are
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.360]   Even if you haven't seen them in five years, you have to be where they are
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.400]   It's actually a problem of how to get other your friends and family onto it saying with chat apps
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.640]   It's such a lock into the system
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:10.160]   But I mean, I think that possibility exists if facebook was gonna be one of those like it's like makarsoff from the 90s
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:16.000]   They hurt themselves enough that people will leave and that's so far facebook's biggest threat has been itself
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.160]   It's inflicting its own damage to itself causing people to to leave but we haven't seen another company
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:28.480]   Leverage or take advantage of that. It's just it's a very difficult problem. I disagree. I'm a little bit more optimistic
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.000]   I think that
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.160]   Facebook was in a really good position to copy snapchat which they did and they basically destroyed snapchat snapchat snapchat hanging on by a threat
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   They destroyed it not with facebook with instagram
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:44.960]   Right and they just stole facebook's core feature which is stories just completely ripped it off made a better version that has more daily users
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.200]   Right they put it into what's that people like in a what's up
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.760]   I do not think that tick that facebook is well positioned to copy tick tock
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.720]   I don't think that they're gonna be able to copy tick tock and that's what all the teens are using
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:59.600]   But it's fundamentally different isn't tick-tock just another vine and vine didn't survive
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:07.440]   What makes you think tick tock's gonna last teens are notoriously fickle they're gonna be doing something they they came to tick tock through musically
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.960]   They're just gonna do something else in a year or two or the next generation is gonna say oh we like this instead
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:17.040]   I do you really think that that tick tock is a is a threat to facebook
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:23.280]   Not to facebook necessarily but I think that there's at least some differentiation like it's not just it's not just facebook and instagram
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.320]   Really there's another app that has a you know owned by a different company. I see what you're saying
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.560]   Yeah, there's already a really strong
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.360]   Facebook we need to think of new things
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.160]   Yeah, they have a much more interesting revenue model
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:39.200]   I think that's not completely driven by advertising like the kind of like sponsored content they do on tick tock
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.360]   I think is a little bit more innovative and not something that
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.720]   Facebook can easily copy and there's you know, it's been downloaded over a billion times. That's pretty good
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:52.160]   But you don't use tick tock. I mean the tick tock's for 12 year olds. I love tick tock. I use tick tock all the time
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.440]   Oh, really?
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.040]   Yeah, I think tick tock's great. It's really fun. Are you a creator? Do you make videos?
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.280]   I make some videos, but I would not say I'd say I mostly view rather than
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:07.120]   Then create but I like making tick tock's. It's fun. It's in a way that I think posting on facebook is absolutely not
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:13.440]   And you say it's definitely a bunch more creative and your friend group is obviously must also use tick tock, right?
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.760]   I would say most of my friends use tick tock or tech writers. So it's probably not a fair
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.320]   group of people, but I was surprised on tick tock how many
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.760]   Yeah, the stereotype is that it's 13 year olds, but there are like cops on tick tock their teachers on tick tock
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.400]   There are moms on tick tock like there are there's way too many people using it for it to just be
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.680]   Teens who does not enough teens
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:40.960]   So there's a baffle thing. This looks exactly to me like exactly like fun. It's like everything else
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.520]   Why is this why is this better than vine and why didn't vine survive if this is such a good idea?
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:53.600]   Wasn't vine more about a financial decision not necessarily like I'm not sure they got sold. Yeah, but they didn't really need to kill vine
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.280]   And vine had a lot of
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:01.040]   original creators who saw you know back they later became youtube stars and tried to transition to youtube ones
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.840]   youtube stars
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.560]   Really big youtube stars like a lot of those people succeeded
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:11.520]   You know, it's not as though like the creators on there were bad or like weren't popular by any minutes
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.720]   So it's ironic because twitter bought vine and by doing so helped youtube
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.160]   Which is basically which is weird
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.280]   Okay. Yeah, two two things
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:28.400]   first I I don't think I'll ever understand the whole social media
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:37.360]   issue far as unfriending somebody if this were just regular everyday life and somebody I haven't talked to in five years
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:42.560]   It just it just goes on life just goes on. I don't bring them up. They don't bring me up
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.400]   And it just life goes on the difference is
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.200]   It seems like it's affecting people
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:55.520]   By going in and clicking unfollow. Does it send notifications when someone unfollows you or what have you
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.280]   People know they're they see their numbers go down, right?
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.840]   Like the
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.800]   Still not saying and prove it unfollows you because
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:11.520]   They find out who's they would culprit is and there were I remember even on twitter this was a thing
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   You can get a twitter app. It was
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:18.320]   See your followers and who you follow and it would actually show you who would apologize
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.960]   Yeah, and it was just like oh
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.040]   And then it's psychological it really messes with you because you're like what did I say?
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.280]   Well, I noticed
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.000]   The more I tweeted the more people left so if you say nothing on twitter
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.600]   That's when you're following that or just bring up politics
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.680]   Anything you say is going to offend somebody you're going to lose followers. So shut up
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:46.880]   And my account just goes up or own the offensiveness, which is what I try to do
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:53.280]   This the world of social media can we agree is broken badly broken and not good for
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:59.200]   Humans and other living things. Yeah, I have a lot of thought on it because like humans are where I call them
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:07.280]   We're psychotic and social like we're we're just obsessed with the need to have human contact at any level
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:12.640]   No matter how far this thing it is and seeing someone and being able to share and you know
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.880]   And really just go out there and create in part of it
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.720]   It stems from that creative ability as humans
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   Some of it just is just the fact we talk and where do you only species that talks at least at this sophisticated level
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.800]   And we just have this need inside to constantly share
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:32.320]   Which is why every computational program that comes out the first thing that people come up with are like ways to talk to other people
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.120]   Whether it's a messaging like if you look back at the internet days like the early days. It was messaging right? I brought up a
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.480]   And like
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.640]   Actually, I go back far enough on the internet
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:50.800]   That the initial experiences of the internet and this is pre web. This is go for an Archie and stuff. We're very sterile
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.080]   Usenet was you know the news groups were
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:01.120]   One way and but I think you're exactly right that there was the strong pressure was to become a communication medium
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:07.520]   And that really the internet did not become a mass tool until it was about communication
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.960]   And in fact you could probably make the argument about computers in general
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:16.320]   That it wasn't until they became communications devices that they got mass acceptance the kind
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.880]   But this is the weird thing about social media
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:24.240]   Is it appeals to people who have isolated themselves because of technology? Yes
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.680]   With pseudo communica pseudo relationship
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:33.840]   I admit that it is a pseudo relationship from not a healthy thing. I don't think
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   I'm a
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.880]   Really really really stubborn introvert and I don't have a lot of what do you say?
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:47.440]   What do you call them? IRL friends in real-life friends see this is why you and I get along because i'm the same way
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.920]   I bet most of the people listen to show are stubborn introverts
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.360]   You know and and i'm totally fine. We're just spending my time in these four walls and doing what I do
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.320]   I work my family, but I do enjoy the friends that I have made
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.160]   socially on
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.120]   social media whether it's twitter or google plus long live google plus
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:12.400]   And just talking to them here and there over my mobile phone or over the computer
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:17.600]   And it's okay. It's just not I don't feel any pressure
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.680]   About the social media stuff the way other people are filling in with this
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.200]   This whole
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.160]   friending and
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:29.840]   Unfriending and likes and dislikes and it just I don't get it. You don't like I get it though
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.160]   If you're a teenager and you go on instagram
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:38.640]   Your friends and they're out doing something on a friday night having the time their lives and you're watching on your phone from home
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.920]   That that is the teenager that stuff is like
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.640]   Well, yes from a teenage standpoint that does make sense, you know
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.800]   Well, well, we're talking about two different things
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:54.720]   I think is the issue is that like the issue with facebook and why it's uncomfortable is that what facebook did in instagram is that they leverage
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.880]   Your real life social graph, right?
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.800]   Like the people you friend on facebook are mostly people that you know from real life first
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.680]   And that's like facebook's value is that like it actually has a social graph that mirrors the real world
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   Yeah, I like twitter better
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.400]   I like tiktok better because i'm following people I don't know for the most part from real life
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.920]   And it is a window into something new whereas like facebook is a window into like my past because it's everyone I actually know
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.760]   Interesting you like it. You don't know the people you follow on twitter
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.880]   Well, because it's something new right like i'm not seeing like, you know an acquaintance baby or something
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:31.200]   I'm seeing like, you know, someone who lives in the other side of the world or someone who has a different viewpoint for me
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   You know, I think that's more interesting
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:40.800]   Maybe this is just me but one of the reasons I left twitter I kind of my account still there because I I can't force myself to throw away half a million
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.040]   followers, but
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.000]   One of the reasons I stopped using it is I realized I was using it
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.480]   As a distraction I was using it as like i'm bored
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.160]   I'm gonna look at a twitter feed and it's good at that right because it's a bunch of stuff
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.240]   It's all okay. It's you know, boom boom boom. It's very dazzly
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.080]   And I realized that that wasn't a healthy use of that that was like
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:07.440]   That was like crack that was like, you know jacking into something because I was bored
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.080]   and they were oh yeah
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.040]   And I didn't think that was a healthy thing is that
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.960]   You said that about any of the social media all of it is yeah all of it ultimately is
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.800]   Yeah, I don't think we've like learned how to reckon with that and I don't think we I don't think we're gonna know
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:28.720]   It's we're all kind of the test generation of this right like none of us have been using any of the stuff for more than you know
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:33.360]   10 15 years like maybe you use use net or something like that, but the real like super charged
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.960]   Uh
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.720]   Newsfeeds are only what you less than 10 years old for the most part
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:42.960]   Yeah, so I think that we just don't know exactly how this is like, you know messing with our brains
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.160]   I think it's hard sometimes
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:49.360]   I mean I am because I have been using this going back to the well in the mid 90s and the use net
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.760]   I have been using this for more than 20 years
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:58.400]   And I am starting to pull back not liking what it's done and how I killed my facebook
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:03.040]   Account I killed my instagram account at first I killed my twitter account then I thought better of it
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.320]   But maybe I still will I think maybe followers
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.520]   Yeah, that's the thing it's hard to throw away that many followers
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.320]   But i'm thinking that maybe in five or ten years
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.360]   Louise you'll be doing the same thing you'll have come to that same point
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.880]   Yeah, I definitely think I have I deleted instagram
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.320]   I don't redownload instagram
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.440]   I delete twitter or redownload twitter like I definitely have like a lover love and hate relationship with the stuff
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.200]   And I think it's definitely like fundamentally unhealthy in a way that like no one is like
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.800]   Oh, I'm gonna stop reading books because like that's making me feel bad
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.080]   Right like we don't have that same kind of relationship with other forms of media
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:43.040]   Maybe television people do try and watch less television, but I don't think it's the same like this is hurting a deep part of my brain
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:47.600]   It is exactly the phenomenon that happens with any addiction
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:52.480]   Although I would say in the process of getting off an addiction. That's exactly what addicts do
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.720]   Is we we go. Oh, yeah get rid of it all and then we go. Oh, I can't I can't leave you and then we come
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.040]   There's this push pull until eventually either goes one way or the other
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.960]   I think that's a that's a classic syndrome. Go ahead. I'm sorry Daniel
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.720]   Oh, no, it's just gonna say with Netflix
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:12.080]   It wasn't there that study out recently showing that people are having less coitus
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.480]   Because they binge watching shows
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.720]   We will know if in a few years the birth rate population doesn't decide
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.760]   Is it already plummeting?
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.760]   Yeah, apparently
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:27.040]   But we're not any social media too like I mean I
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:32.080]   Usually in plug on twitter on the weekends like I really don't look at it and I take force time off
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:37.120]   We we have phones now that tell you how much time you're using you know, it's too better
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.200]   Which is I think a big
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:42.480]   Harbinger of all this stuff are really showing you the problem
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.400]   But also that we recognize it right that we're trying to now put in restraints on this
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.880]   So that we're not looking at our phones too much
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.200]   But we are constantly surrounded by
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   Data information and we want it we crave it
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.360]   But we do need to take breaks from it
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.880]   I think people are becoming a little bit aware of this more and it's gonna have to evolve eventually education schools around just
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:08.400]   You know like a civics course i'll teach you about online civility and how to best use social
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.640]   It needs to be integrated at some level so people have this information for themselves
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:16.720]   Totally agree now one more thing getting back to the whole
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.760]   F8 statement from mr. Zuckerberg
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:23.680]   I know most of us are like yeah, he's full of crap, but
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:31.920]   Is that fair should we give them the chance to to to earn our trust back? I agree 100%
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.360]   I am going to give him the chance the minute he does this
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:40.240]   I won't recreate my facebook account, but at this point they've done nothing
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.480]   Right
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.520]   I think there's no such thing wrong. We're sleeping with one eye open, you know, but yeah give him a shot
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.200]   you know
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:53.120]   They're gonna have to do this just for business reasons and that's always sort of the worst reason
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.160]   Like they're not doing this because all of a sudden they're like, you know
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.120]   We decided we're going to be a leader in this area
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   They're doing it because they're about to face a massive fine a fine so large that they're like don't focus on how much the fine
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.120]   $3 billion to $5 billion
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:12.720]   Yeah, you know, so there don't look at that, you know, but so they're doing it fun, but they have to do for business reasons
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:16.720]   They're they're publicly traded. They have stock. They have it's very public what they do
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   So they're going to turn us around because
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:23.200]   The public is turning against them. So it's a PR thing and that doesn't mean
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.560]   You know, listen Microsoft had to do that too, right?
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.760]   A lot of companies go through this stage where they're just not publicly
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.720]   Admired anymore and they have to change and that's fine
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.720]   It's market pressure is changing for hopefully the good but it does remain to be seen
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:40.080]   But I think they'll they will have to do this because people are going to just demand it
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.240]   Yeah
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.480]   I for one i'm not looking forward to a world where
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:50.720]   Instagram dms facebook messenger and WhatsApp is all integrated on the back end. I think that sounds like a nightmare
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.760]   Uh, that's one aspect of this pivot to privacy that i'm not really looking forward to
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.800]   I do wish though that there were you kind of a unified platform because that we mentioned that earlier
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:06.960]   Uh, I don't know how to actually hanker for aim, but it would be nice to have one messaging platform that worked with everything
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.440]   Trillion yeah
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.920]   Pigeon
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.480]   Those were the days right
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.920]   Actually
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.520]   Go ahead
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.880]   I was just saying for like seamless reasons it is nice to have something kind of streamlined
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.200]   But like if you don't want to be on facebook and you just want to be an instagram
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.720]   It sucks to have that integration and I think that part of the reason they're doing that is to
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.040]   Uh, you know, stave off antitrust accusations that they own three of the biggest
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.760]   You know social and messaging platforms in the world and instead they're gonna say actually they're just one platform
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.160]   Yeah, you know, there's they're not three platforms anymore
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.880]   And I think that we have to look at kind of the reasons why they're doing that
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.920]   Well, that's exactly the reason I wouldn't want to do whatever that platform is I wouldn't really want to do apple messages
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.120]   Either I'd love it if signal or some third party
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.320]   Became so dominant worldwide. We could all use it
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.720]   I'm not a facebook user and haven't been for a couple years now
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:03.440]   Um did the whole account deletion, but I do use instagram very regularly your photographer
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.800]   Right. I have to do it to help try to grow my small business. It is what it is
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.040]   But am I essentially a facebook user because i'm using instagram
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   Yes
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.280]   Yeah, definitely
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.280]   Mark gets the same information
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.760]   Yeah, I mean, I know they're getting the whole data and whatnot, but I just I just
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.280]   Thought about that here
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   I don't think from your point of view
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.080]   So there's two answers to that because from mark's point of view. He's perfectly happy to have you use any of the above
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.160]   But on your point of view it is a very different experience one of the reasons people like instagram is because it's not facebook
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.280]   It's just pictures. That's me. Yeah, I'm in that category
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.880]   I I wish that every ninth picture weren't an ad for something that I really don't need but really have to buy
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.880]   Dude, you had to talk about the creepy instagram ads and the microphone listening to you a thing, right?
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.480]   Because that's 100% true. I don't care what anybody says. It's not coincidence. I can be talking about something weird
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:06.080]   I've had so many examples of real life about this and then I turn on instagram and an ad shows up for that specific topic and i'm like
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.920]   Come on. That's conspiracy theory. I reject that entirely except you're probably right. I can
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.400]   10 for my daughter swears
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.240]   She did an experiment with her friends
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:24.560]   They said into they said into the phone baby duck baby duck baby duck baby duck then all of a sudden she started getting ads for baby ducks at her instagram
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:31.200]   Fate. Oh, I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I can't imagine that's happening. It happened so many times
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.920]   Technically the difficulty you know this you're an expert in security help me luis
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.640]   They would have to be sending data back from everybody's phones all the time
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.880]   Parsing that data
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.320]   Looking for keywords and then changing the ads. That's a lot of work
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.080]   There's no evidence
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.040]   There's no evidence
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.400]   But there is some evidence that you know it has a lot to do the ads that you see have a lot to do with your social connection
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.880]   So if you're hanging out with somebody that your instagram friends with and you guys are talking about something that like maybe they have looked up recently
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.920]   There is a chance more that you're gonna see an ad for that
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.120]   You have your friends like hey, which is really great store and she's telling you about that
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.000]   And you get an ad for it that has more to do with the fact that you guys are in the same location
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.800]   She just googled that store, you know, there's a lot of other factors here that are in geolocation ads
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   You have your do you have your location tracking on
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.600]   There are a lot more questions
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.560]   That that I think are creepier really than them just listening to you
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:33.280]   I know about your estimate the power and value of the shadow profiles
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:40.320]   That there's so many data points your data smog your data exhaust is everywhere all the time
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.360]   And what's changed is now the ability to gather that analyze it and the willingness of companies to share that data across
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:53.440]   Silos that's giving I think that's it is creepier really because it means yeah
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.600]   They know a lot more about us
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:02.400]   And it changes really quickly and I encourage that you want to just like start looking up a random topic on instagram and see how quickly their ads change
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.000]   One of my favorite recent recent examples is my friend was telling me how all these celebrities got lip injections
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.360]   And I was like, I don't know if I don't know if I believe that I want to see that before and after pictures
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.800]   So, you know, this isn't really like me, but I started, you know, looking up like hashtag lip injection or like, you know, and
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.440]   I was getting bizarre ads immediately for like, you know
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.360]   facial
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:31.200]   Surgery I was getting ads for like ab workouts like all this weird stuff that happened like I only after looking up like maybe one or two hashtags
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.720]   So that's what it is. Do you think it would work if I search for angel investors
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   I could use a couple extra dollar signs, you know
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.480]   I have
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:52.000]   Yeah, I mean that's obvious though. I mean you're sending them a strong signal when you do hashtag lip injections
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:59.600]   Right, but I think people don't realize when they're like mindlessly looking at something like even briefly or they click on something in their explorer page
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:05.440]   Or they have their location tracking on I don't think they realize how sensitive these systems can be sure that's a really overt thing
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.120]   But you might do something more subtle and not really understand how that's
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:15.360]   Creepy or why it feels like you're being listened to and you're really not so according to the New York times the ftc
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:20.560]   Chairman seems to have the votes to approve a settlement. So we don't know what that number will be
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:25.120]   The facebook put aside three billion dollars, but it could be more up to five. They say
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.840]   one of the biggest issues according to the times
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:34.720]   Is whether to hold mark succerberg personally liable for future violations?
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:41.760]   Is the boss? Why not? I won't do it. They won't do it ill set of presidents and that's going to be dangerous for corporations
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.560]   Maybe people but the presidents the chairman the founders those aren't people
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.640]   So you should be but I don't think they'll do it there there actually is a little bit of precedent here already
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.080]   So when the tick-tock violation came down, I think what it was in march
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.680]   Maybe yeah, maybe march where they violated the children's protection
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.520]   Privacy protection act because they were collecting data on people under 13
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:12.240]   And two ftc commissioners actually wrote in a letter after that fine came down and said we think that the people running tick-tock should be personally
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.960]   Highly accountable for this and they weren't but the ftc has already said that you know
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:22.800]   We don't want to go down this path where we just find these companies chump change instead of actually holding the executives accountable
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:28.000]   And I think especially in facebook's case where you have a super omni powerful c o
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.200]   Like succerberg who basically controls the company even though it's public. I think he's a perfect person to be held personally accountable
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.680]   Yeah, it would be the largest ftc fine ever against the tech company the biggest they've done up to now
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.840]   Was a mere 22 and a half million against google in 2012
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.800]   3 billion the 5 billion i wonder if they even have
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.280]   The votes to do that i'm thinking that that in this
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.960]   Current climate maybe would even that would be hard to do
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:06.240]   I don't know. I want to see how how we're going along as a society where
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.080]   when
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:15.200]   Crap hits the fan leadership just sort of tux or tail and run and points at the subordinates
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:22.480]   You know when when you're the leader of the leader of the pack you're given directions and guidance and so on and so forth
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.680]   And with all of that success, it's usually a reflection of your leadership
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:35.440]   So when when crap goes wrong, why not just stand up for and say hey, you know, I I hold some responsibility here
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.440]   Yep, now that I agree on the percent
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.920]   I mean they should be more like how the military you know
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:47.680]   They take the responsibility for when the company is successful and they get all the bonuses and you know greatest CEO ever
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:53.200]   They put them on Bloomberg magazine with halos over their head, but then you know, yeah, what stuff goes wrong
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.880]   I was and they're not personally responsible and so they really should be this higher level
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.720]   I'm you know skeptical the last few years, especially the environment
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.440]   How we've been treating this though, I agree. I don't even three billion i'd be surprised
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.720]   It seems like everything's a let down you which you're like this could happen and it's always a lot less than that so
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:18.240]   Facebook's arguing you can't hold mr. Zuckerberg responsible for the act of his 35,000 employees except
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.760]   If you want to be effective in all this, I think holding him responsible might actually work better
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   Exactly. I think that's fine in a company
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.360]   Not organized like facebook where you know, zuckerberg has controlled the majority of the voting shares
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:39.520]   So he is responsible, you know, I think if it was Jeff Bezos for example, he controls what 12 percent of the company or something
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.240]   You know, he's not the one just making all the decisions there whereas
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.760]   Zuckerberg designed facebook that he's basically the dictator of facebook
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:51.600]   So this is a democracy that was my understanding. Yeah, you know and I listened to kara swisher a lot and
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.880]   It he seems to think that if something is going to go down. What's her name?
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.760]   Sandberg she's going to catch a lot of heat Cheryl Sandberg. Yeah, she got the heat for hiring
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.320]   the pr firm that ended up
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.880]   What was it investigating? I can't remember the deal, but it was nasty
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:17.440]   Just shows you you know if you let enough time pass everybody goes, you know, there was that thing. I don't remember anyway
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.920]   It's over now. So what's on instagram?
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.480]   How's that twitter feed?
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.840]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books. I love fresh books. I first discovered it back in
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:38.320]   2004 I was I was a complaining to amber MacArthur when I used to have to go to Canada to do the tv shop there
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.840]   And I was complaining her because I have to send an invoice at the end of every month
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.360]   And I hadn't done it in a few months because I'm lazy and then I didn't pay me and I thought this is terrible
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.160]   She said oh, there's a brand new company. Just started up in toronto
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.920]   In fact, I'll tell you what this she said. It's a web 2.0 company
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.400]   I'll give you some I teat the time frame call fresh books and they make it really easy to do invoices
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.160]   So I started it was like a it was incredible. They do the currency conversion
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.920]   I could use the fresh books app take pictures of receipts automatically get them into my expense report
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:13.680]   And I got paid faster. In fact on average you get paid according to fresh books research twice as fast
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.320]   Because it turns out the fresh books invoice allows you to accept online payments
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.720]   Credit card payments on and if there's a button right in the invoice that says pay
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.200]   And your clients they don't like paying bills anymore letting them you like sending bills
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:33.760]   So if you make it easy for them, they actually pay faster. You'll spend less time on paperwork more time doing what you love
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.480]   You didn't get into this to do invoices, right?
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.080]   But you got to do the invoices fresh books makes it easy and by the way
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.480]   Simply by doing the invoices by channeling the expenses
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.200]   Keeping track of your time and hours. You're actually doing your books. It's accounting software
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.960]   So you can get the reports you need when it's tax time

[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.920]   It'll just do it for you easily. So it starts with professional looking invoices
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.840]   It starts with automatically recording expenses tracking time
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.720]   But by the time you're done
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.840]   You've got all everything you need to understand for instance something I never knew is a freelancer at my making money

[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.520]   Free fresh books is awesome. I love those fresh books guys
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.960]   So facebook
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:15.760]   Google didn't you you mentioned this actually uh, daniel the google's uh growth was only 17 percent
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:21.040]   Great not good enough great gasps from wall street. How dare they
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.360]   um
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:29.440]   Is there anything to say I guess the problem for google is advertising revenues are not growing as fast as they used to
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:36.960]   Yeah, I mean this gets on to same issue with apples facing right which is apples, you know primary source revenues the iphone
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.880]   And that's and the iphone did very well for many years and as a cash cow
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:46.000]   But as phone sales start to plateau apples facing an issue here and trying to you know
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.160]   How they would continue to grow and make money google has this issue a bit too
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.040]   You know as I mentioned 30 billion out of that 36 billion in revenue is is from advertising
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.120]   That's an enormous amount of money
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:02.560]   Whereas, you know, they get 5.7 billion. I think from their other products and services and the pixel, you know
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:07.360]   Which gets all the headlines. It's barely a blip. It's not even a top 10 of smartphones
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:12.720]   It's huge for tech people who talk about this stuff all the time but for consumers and the market
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.520]   It's not no and so and and then they're losing a ton of money on things like waymo and there
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.320]   You know their bets that they're doing which is fine
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.560]   You know companies should have that reserve fund they have plenty of money to explore new ideas
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.840]   And they should be doing that and they're increasing their rnd but um
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.880]   The advertising is getting more competitive. There are a lot of companies that are forming alliances out there are trying to and take them on and it's a
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:42.640]   You know the nature of the web itself is changing how we view ads how to monetize things. It's never a secure thing
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.760]   But I mean financially they're not going away right?
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:52.640]   Global is not going under. No, but they had to be wary of the stuff about how they're going to make money eventually without just advertising
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.920]   They also took a 1.7 billion dollar 1.5 euro billion euro
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.880]   Loss due to the EU's fine
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.480]   And of course more EU fines look like they're coming along the way
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.640]   They even mentioned headwinds in the smartphone market even though the pixel isn't a big part of their revenue
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.840]   They're having trouble selling it. They're expected to announce on Tuesday when google.io
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:20.640]   Happens a lower cost pixel three this pixel three a
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.760]   Maybe announce a new
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.920]   Google assistant with a camera and a and a screen new home hub
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:35.920]   Uh and perhaps even a new smartwatch on based on android wear so we'll look we'll look for that
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.160]   Sundar Pichai described the google home smart speaker as a market leader put that in quotes
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.720]   It's a market leader and
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.920]   It's doing better than the apple home pod. We can we can agree on yes
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:54.080]   Somewhat somewhat smaller sales than the amazon echo, but you know it's somewhere in in between the two of those kind of like
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.000]   Kind of like web services. You've got amazon. You got microsoft. You got google
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.960]   You know they're in there. They're in google though has they have the most growth though for home stuff, right?
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.040]   I think that's where it comes out to the concern against amazon amazon seems to
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.120]   They have the mind share right now, but google seems to have the more devices
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:17.760]   More partners getting this stuff out there. I mean, I've had I think spotify. I want to just send me a google home thing when I signed up
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:23.600]   So just giving you this little puck. Oh, they're giving them away now. Yeah, absolutely and all for all sorts of things
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:29.280]   I'm just not convinced that that market is that big like I don't I think the home speaker market is gonna
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:35.440]   Take a little plateau real. Yeah, I think real soon. I just I think the use cases are pretty small
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.720]   I I personally don't have one for privacy reasons number one
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.360]   I think they've gotten up bad press that a lot of people are kind of weirded out by them and the use case that
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.200]   They're basically a smart speaker, right? Like that's kind of it like you know
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.760]   There's all these skills you can load on to it to do all these other things
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.760]   But like beyond like hey, what's the weather and like you know play Beyonce?
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.080]   Like I just don't really see these major use cases
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:01.520]   And I don't think it's gonna be a major revenue stream for most of these companies. I think Amazon is smart because it you know
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.200]   Order dog food. I think is a better use case than
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.440]   you know
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.280]   Do be doing google searches on it like that. I think the mobile experience is just so much better
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.760]   Why would I embarrass myself by like being like hey?
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:19.440]   Oh when I can just yeah go on my iPhone. It's really just so I don't get it. Well, you're alone. I do it all the time
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.760]   I would be embarrassed anybody were around, but it's just me
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.000]   The Amazon example is so good. Louise like I mean that was its goal, right?
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.360]   So Amazon's intent for this wasn't like oh, let's have smart speakers
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.360]   It was let's give users another tool so they can order Amazon services and it's like
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.720]   You know you just say it in order and that was the concept
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:43.120]   But wasn't I think it was the intercept ran a story last year is showing how only 2% of like
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.760]   Others actually use it to order stuff of Amazon
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.320]   So in that in that regard like conceptually this device is a complete failure
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.840]   It's in a lot of homes and it has the mind share, but it's not doing so then it comes down to all right
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.800]   What do you where are they making money off of this thing from is it like Spotify and selling associate like you know
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.880]   They get referrals or something like that. I don't know and and google of course
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.480]   It's going to try to monetize all the data they can collect from you, but I agree
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:14.400]   We're still not used to one talk into computers partly because of natural language. It's just not there
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.600]   By the way teaser. We will see more of this from microsoft this week. There are advances coming for
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:20.800]   uh
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.800]   Stuff in this area in folk
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.840]   Yeah, maybe not. I don't know about that. I am the only person in the world I have in my office
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:33.120]   Uh a google home speaker and amazon echo show and an harm and card and invoke
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.800]   It's a good speaker. I could talk to any google any assistant I want
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.040]   Anytime
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.960]   But they do have useful. Yeah, really useful. I don't use the book much
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.880]   They're they're basically jukeboxes and things you asked random question
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.680]   But it's but it's like how does it evolve? I will say
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:54.480]   Google's, you know, they're supposed to be teasing this new hub thing and I we've talked about this
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.600]   I went essential
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:00.800]   Microsoft was exploring this idea years ago and I think when you add a screen to these things like alexa show
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.760]   Already a show that's pretty do become yeah
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.400]   It does now also change the user and action model and it becomes a lot more interesting
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.400]   And so I think this concept of a 10 inch device that is a centralized hub
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.920]   I think is
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.840]   Something the next stage for these devices and it's a little bit more interesting
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:24.880]   Um, especially as we get more more smart homes and connect things up to each other a centralized repository is interesting
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.280]   I wish michael's off was
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.440]   Going to do they were supposed to do something care
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.280]   I'm not sure if they're still going to because again if I have to choose between companies, you know apple for security
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:41.600]   Microsoft next for privacy and then it's like I really don't want to do google or amazon little sketchy of their stuff
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.680]   So, what do you worry about?
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.240]   These go ahead and then i'll talk to luis go ahead dan
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:53.680]   If you're going to add these these home services or what have you and put screens on them put screens on them that are more than 2%
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.560]   Larger than my phone. Well, that was the google home hub
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.960]   That really was tiny. It makes no sense. They're all voice activated and whatnot
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.320]   But you can't see the screen from the other side. There are larger ones Lenovo and uh, they're there are large
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.840]   JBL they're larger screens. We'll see what google's supposed to do not something
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:17.600]   Uh, tuesday, luis you said that they surprised me you have privacy concerns about having a voice assistant in your house
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.160]   Yeah, I definitely don't want a smart speaker in my house
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:24.720]   I think that we just saw that report in bloomberg that they did not have them properly
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:31.280]   Anonymize and they were having people listen to these for to improve their uh voice recognition software
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.400]   Which is fine. I think you should be doing that but they weren't even properly
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.960]   You know it was attached you could have some someone's home address and the recording inside their house
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.200]   And you know there was that extremely disturbing
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:47.360]   Uh anecdote in the bloomberg story where they said that someone who was listening to these their job is to you know
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:53.760]   Listen to these recordings overheard a sexual assault. That's horrifying. Yeah, and what do you do when that happens?
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.640]   Yeah, they basically amazon the
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:02.000]   Anonymous employees said that amazon's response is that son of our business and I just don't think I don't really see the
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.640]   I don't see the um
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   You know, we're just talking about I don't I just don't see the uh
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:11.360]   Exchange here. Like what am I really getting in return? I totally agree having a screen
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.240]   But then there's this weird question of like where does that go?
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:19.680]   We don't really have like it's not very cute to have like this kind of ugly bulky screen on your counter
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:26.080]   Kind of reminds me of like uh a desktop phone like that's kind of what we kind of removed from our kitchen counter, you know
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.800]   Yeah, I'm hoping that we get to the point where I would like a screen where I can just be like, you know
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:35.120]   Show me the best apple pie recipe and something comes up that would be nice or you know
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:39.280]   Tell me the weather and it comes up like that, but I kind of want that I want the movie fantasy
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.440]   I want it built into the the wall. I don't really want like this ugly Lenovo
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.960]   Screen or the facebook portal or whatever. That's like on my table
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:52.400]   You're not doing your first step install you have to buy these crappy versions
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.480]   Because report development so that you can eventually get the magical version
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:02.320]   Yeah, I just don't think it's there yet. I consider this my job. I have to use all these things
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.640]   It's the same reason I bought a Tesla. It's not because I thought this is the greatest thing ever
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.600]   But I want to support the future. They're of electric cars
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.400]   Like honestly though, I'm a good person
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.320]   That's like
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.840]   If you have $250 or something to spend on one of these things 300 bucks, I would much rather get a really nice
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:25.520]   Looking a bow speaker or a really nice one of those like long whatever those bar speakers and have that in my house
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.840]   Be able to play really nice music in the sound bars
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.560]   That's just a nicer item. I think to have then like a facebook portal on my
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:37.360]   You know kitchen counter. I can talk to grandma like I just don't have a facebook portal on my kitchen counter
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.960]   Wow
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.920]   I hear they're pretty good. I haven't tried one, but I hear that they're actually pretty good
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.280]   Yeah, there's one drive motion tracking is pretty cool. I give them that
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:52.320]   Yeah, I gave him both to berk to take apart and he broke one right you couldn't take it apart without smashing it
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320]   It wasn't waiting. Oh berg's glued
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:01.440]   I was hoping we could do something. I don't know. I wanted to hear I wanted to put you guys in facebook portals instead of these tv screens
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.680]   I just have three facebook portals on here
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.640]   I want that snowed in what does that see like rolls out in a little robot? Yeah, I want one of those
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.480]   Yeah, I bought one of those too. They don't
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.480]   Jesus
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.480]   With regards to the to this earning call in q1
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:23.920]   It's it's still q1. I don't think it's enough to to to to be all panicky about it the way
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:31.440]   Wall Street tends to be the way Wall Street is. Yeah, you know, I I will never understand that and we go through this
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:36.640]   Every single year even with apple as they sit on a bank road
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.000]   That's more money than anybody else on the planet it seems like
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.920]   And it was stressed out and say oh my goodness apple is in trouble and then when q4 rolls around like whoa apple
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:51.920]   It's just so awesome and so great. It's because it's because no they're doing most of these companies know what they're doing
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.600]   Finally, it's a real precious. It's real precious with apple though
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:02.880]   There's a reason I paid more taxes this last April than google paid. There's a reason for that
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.480]   They know it's a good thing. I really don't amazon paid zero taxes
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:11.920]   Halliburton paid zero taxes don't get me started on amazon in taxes
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.040]   Like i just like i'll that's makes me so angry
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:21.040]   But but yeah, I mean but the thing about you know q1 for google versus you know q1 for apple is that
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:28.080]   You know the part of the reason that you might not be seeing these things in q1 is that apple will have you know black friday and
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.600]   holiday season
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.280]   They have giant fourth quarters when or whatever I guess it's jack q1
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:37.600]   It always happens because that's when all the new iPhones come out and then the q2 is a little bit of a slowdown
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:43.600]   All right, exactly, but honestly that is a that I think is a malign influence on the way these companies work
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:51.280]   Is that there is so much pressure in the stock market to show the super high growth levels that the market really will will ding them for even
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.280]   The slightest infraction makes these companies
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.880]   Pushing in the wrong direction in many cases
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:01.440]   Trying to appease the market instead of innovator or or do the right thing
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.880]   I mean, you know tesla is a good example this recently although people could argue about
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:14.560]   Elon musk, but like the fact is it's like they shipped way more cars this year the same time this year than they did last year
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.160]   And so they they're having significant growth, but they're not able to meet sort of the numbers
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.120]   Some of them some of the numbers they set themselves internally, but
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:30.640]   You know it's there is this pressure, but then again their stock hasn't suffered as much as nearly as much as the shorts would want them to suffer
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.920]   So
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:37.760]   You know their stock is actually doing all right considering the bad news that they had in the last few days as far as apple though
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.880]   I do see apple is sitting on a ton of money. So that's good
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.680]   but
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:47.520]   You know as a publicly traded company that it is about what comes next and this issue with the iPhone
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:53.040]   I think is really interesting because I've been saying for two years now the smartphones they're plateauing we're leveling off and this is
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:59.840]   This is a good thing. This isn't bad news. It's a commodification of the these devices as they reach a maturity level
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.880]   Just like how we don't really do this podcast. We don't talk about like refrigerators the latest tech and refrigerate
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.600]   Even though I guarantee you samsung has a brand new refrigerator at best by right now. That's like really neat
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:15.360]   But it's because it's just technology stuff we get used to and phones are going through this right now
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.600]   And apple is seeing you know facing the pressure to most if you look at china
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:27.600]   They're having problems there. They've had a cut prices. You have companies like Huawei who i've been saying the chinese companies for years were accused of copying
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:30.240]   Apple and samsung and they were blatantly
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:37.520]   But they've gone now from that to like now they're surpassing apple and samsung at a lower cost and I see what china is doing
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.560]   In tech especially mobile. It's going to be one of the biggest threats probably more for so korea
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:47.520]   I see lg exiting smartphones eventually samsung i think it's got a real challenge
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.200]   They they're chasing apple and now they're getting from behinds in the low
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.840]   Low to mid range smartphone segment and you're going to see you know apple
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:02.160]   Have to and they they're pivoting what services but their services are solely dependent on the devices
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.480]   They sell themselves because if you're on if you have a windows pc in an android phone
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.720]   You're probably not using a lot of apple services
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:14.240]   And so they're going to have to find this balance between growing their services but keeping they have to keep device sales
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.400]   Going out and it can't be just enough to be chugging along
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:21.200]   So I don't know how they get around them
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.200]   And the problem with apple is that you we don't we don't really think about this when you live in the us
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.360]   But an iphone is a luxury product and I think that that market
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.240]   Tops out somewhere, you know if you're in a third world country
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.840]   You're not getting an iphone
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.200]   You just aren't and that and they don't have any interest in tapping into those markets
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.960]   You know they kind of tried with the se that was supposed to be for the brick countries
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.400]   You know they've they've done a little bit of that
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.280]   But I don't think they have much interest in developing a mid-tier
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.080]   iPhone that's going to cost $400 or something
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:53.120]   They don't want to do that and there's only you know so much they can grow and people are holding on to their iphones longer
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.760]   Which apple hates it's really great for the environment. I've had my iphone seven for almost 24 months now
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.720]   I have no intention of getting a new phone because why would I I think the difference between the seven
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.640]   And the latest phones that are out right now is just not that meaningful because you're right
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.840]   I'm not going to replace my fridge every year. That's insane the same
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:12.560]   Same price
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.960]   You get a fridge for less than a iphone
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.600]   True right right exactly
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.920]   I I think this
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.120]   Has created a little psychosis in apple though
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:27.200]   Uh, and this worries me a little bit and this is from a personal experience. So we
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.560]   uh, prat-pactict Ella hanny one of our great engineers
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.520]   Uh wrote a very simple program for the apple tv
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.720]   Uh that allows you to watch and stream
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:45.200]   Uh a new show of ours called hands-on tech. It's a review show and it reviews everything not just apple stuff
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.080]   It reviews android stuff and windows laptops and other stuff
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.880]   The when he submitted it to apple apple sent it back
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.560]   Saying yeah, you can't have images of non apple products
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.040]   in the images
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.040]   the promo images of your
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.800]   Show
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.200]   They rejected it and we've actually heard from other apple
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:14.320]   Brother developers who write stuff for our network that yeah anytime they have an android phone or an laptop from windows
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.960]   In any of the collateral material they have to delete it before apple accept the
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.520]   Program and i'm i think that we deleted it and apple accepted it. It was like
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.280]   But but what kind of weird paranoia is is that where oh we don't want anybody
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.160]   to know that there's anything besides apple products
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.600]   That's like no it's real level. So that's why you let's see
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:41.120]   Now the stream will have reviews of other products. Are they gonna not like that? I don't understand
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.760]   They said well
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.520]   We just don't want any pictures of other people's devices and our materials
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:53.120]   Well, remember my favorite example of kind of app store insanity is camera. What it's called
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:58.560]   But it's supposed to have been like 2014 there was a mobile game about working in foxcon
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.800]   Right, it was like a social commentary on how awful it was to make iPhones and boxcon
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.880]   And they wouldn't let that game in the app store and there have been a lot of cases like that
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.920]   You know steve jobs famously didn't want porn on the iphone. There was no however
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:17.680]   They promoted the sports illustrated bikini edition app which is more exploitive
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.480]   Then some porn apps
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.880]   Right and there's that place they wouldn't allow third party bikini calendar apps
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.480]   Sports illustrate things fine and i think there's and now there's going to be a case before
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.320]   The supreme court about whether the app store is a monopoly and i think that they've been really tightly controlling that
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:39.280]   I think it's some good ways and you can guarantee that for the most part the apps you downloaded from the app store are going to be safe
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.560]   Which is a good thing, you know, you can't really say that about google play. However
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:48.720]   I think that they're now running into issues where yeah, you have these insane rules that really seem
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:55.360]   You know, they invoke antitrust questions about how closely are they guarding that and that's a good really good sorts of money
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:00.000]   It's you know, a 30 revenue share of every subscription everything that's bought in there
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:06.320]   Which is something that spotify and nephlix are resentful of because apple won't let you won't let those companies take the full share of
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.960]   the subscription yeah, I
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.520]   think I think
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.920]   sometimes companies
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.920]   are worried about the wrong thing
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.880]   and uh
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.880]   I still have the whole
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:28.320]   Environmental talk from apple with using all of those quote unquote recycled parts for the last iphone
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:31.760]   Yeah, uh, they do have a robot that could take them apart
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.920]   Right using all of these recycled parts
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:43.600]   But your margins are still huge on far as what people are going to pay to get that you know, it just blows my mind
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.800]   apples
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.800]   financial results for q2
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:52.960]   Quarterly revenue they still make a lot of money 58 billion dollars. Okay. Yeah a decline
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:59.840]   Here over year of 5 percent quarterly earnings $2.46. That was down 10 percent
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:08.240]   International sales counted for 61 percent of the quarters revenue. That's kind of interesting more than half of apples revenue comes from overseas
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:12.240]   Wow, one point that's why china was a big deal. Yeah, right
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:17.360]   Uh, and they say china's coming back at least tim cooked as 1.4
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.880]   billion
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.880]   active devices
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:25.120]   That's what oprah said right a billion phones in a billion pockets y'all
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   Uh strongest ipad growth in six years
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.560]   That's I guess good. I mean
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.280]   I when you have comparatives like this is like well, yeah, it's it's the strongest in six years
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:39.280]   It's been pretty weak for six years. So
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:44.480]   That and let's be honest. I mean android. They're just they're just not there. There's no competition
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.680]   There's no they own the tablet market. Yeah, do you think surface?
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:56.080]   Computes a little bit against the ipad market. They want to definitely I mean every time we we do a surface review
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:32:01.680]   We always compare to the ipad even though there's like our core audience or like why would you compare those two things?
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.080]   They're vastly different and I think that's arguably true
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:10.000]   But uh if you're just entering the market there's obviously a lot of similarities and pros and cons to each one
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:17.520]   You know so far it's been working our favorite for surface which you can do more with but ipad has its definite usability
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:21.760]   Uh, I'm really really concerned for microsoft sake that once
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:29.040]   Apple phonic gets around and the rumor is for iOS 13. They're going to add mouse and trackpad support to ipad
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:34.160]   That's going to be the real threat because for me I have an ipad I try to use it
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:40.640]   Um, but it's limitation for me is I wish I had a trackpad or mouse support because I'd be so much more for productivity
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:46.800]   Once they finally add that I think it's going to be a real, you know, challenge to microsoft in this area for surface
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:53.520]   There's still service could do way more on a pc end, but that's for a lot of regular people. That's actually going to matter
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.280]   I think quite a bit. Yeah
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:33:01.040]   The problem I've always had with the surface line is it was touted as being something that creators could use
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.520]   um, but
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:10.400]   You want to run 20 layers of photoshop on a you know a graphic project is it's just not going to hold
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.680]   I have the surface go and I really like it, but it's too slow to really
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:20.320]   Commit and that's because of intel and apple nicely chided intel, uh, you know, and so we talked about that
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   I mean so definitely the surface go
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:26.640]   Foreign factor is awesome operating system is you know, all right for its size
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:30.240]   Bezels too big battery not great processor weak spot
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:35.520]   And that's only because marks office be holding to intel and they didn't have any choice really the intel pentium gold
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.240]   Was like literally the only option they had to go with and arm isn't quite ready for mainstream
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:43.760]   Now apple cited intel too for their laptop sales
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:50.240]   Which to give apple credit and credence it as markersoft just the quarter before when windows 10 sales were down
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:55.680]   Sided also intel unable to deliver chips to its partners to get out enough laptop
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.120]   So there's definitely truth to this and we saw intel recently the rumors are circulating now that they're 10 nanometer move
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:08.560]   Is also being slightly pushed into 2020 which is what I've heard along with some devices that uh, i've seen prototypes that will be
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.400]   Watching with that and it's gonna be I think in my opinion worth the weight
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:16.720]   But this but that gets beside a point that intel has problems here with
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.200]   Manufacturing and getting past 14 nanometer and you know meeting it the needs of its partners
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:25.120]   It's pretty clear apple wants to just wean itself off of intel entirely absolutely
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.360]   Yeah, they just want to go make their own chips and they should
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:34.480]   A few years i think they will i will see you know, their developer conferences next month june 7th, uh, they're going all arm eventually
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:38.560]   That's the case. Yeah, yeah, will microsoft do the same with windows with surface
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.080]   Yes, um interesting. Yeah, I think
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.960]   Is the this the goin 50 so the so the problem
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.800]   Which was I used the I had the nvx 2 which was an 835
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:56.080]   Some people are saying the uh, the yoga c6 30 you liked that great device. Yeah, and that's an 850
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.920]   It's fast enough
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.480]   It's getting there. I think for a lot of people it's equipment's like a core i3 processor
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.000]   But it has a 8 gigs of ram on it. So that also helps
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:12.240]   It's right at that cusp where you know if you use it for productivity for like word web browsing email
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.880]   Office stuff. It's totally fine
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.520]   If it starts to if you want to play video games also, it's not very good now you have the 8cx
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.800]   Which should be out around july august which start to see devices there
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:28.960]   Um, the long-term play though is for microsoft switching to what we've been calling windows light or windows core o s
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.280]   Which is sort of this next iterative version of windows. It's a new skew. That's gonna be
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:39.440]   Compable to what chrome o s is but right windows 10 and so that's gonna be their real big push into
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.880]   Next-gen light computing. Uh, it's also holland surface up to we'll be running it and all this kind of stuff
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.440]   But desktop will exist for hardcore desktop users legacy gamers
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:53.520]   But as we move to and I think the world is moving towards light computing the ipad
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:36:00.240]   Essails continue to demonstrate is just this device. We we want a device ironically the ipad is
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:03.520]   Incredibly overpowered for the iOS. It's running
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.960]   Right that thing is a computer. I feel like I got a computer from the future
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.520]   Yep running an operating system from the past
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.800]   Exactly and they added like I said trackpad or mouse support
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.800]   It starts to bridge that gap between computers and I think that's they're going down that path
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:22.800]   The eventually iOS will replace and displace macOS at least on its mainline consumer products
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.080]   I think you're right. I think you're I used to leave macOS for the developer
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:32.080]   People like aunt the professional professionals creators, but that's a tiny fraction of the overall audience
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.200]   Yeah, and the world is moving towards this light computing
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:41.280]   We do more in our smartphones today than we did years ago and that that's affected laptop sales and tablet sales
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:47.360]   Right, so the idea is like could you create a device like this big that folds and what about a folding device?
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.080]   Yeah, I thought that was a let's make folding phones
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.120]   Really hard
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:59.760]   I'm waiting out for glass. I'm waiting for glass. I don't want an olead
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:04.320]   I don't want I want a glass screen and that's what I will get a folding phone
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:08.880]   It's fiction. They always have phones that are clear. They're a little piece of glass that you see through
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:13.120]   That's what they do in science fiction. Oh, I like those. It's cool. Yeah, I think that's cool
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:17.760]   Yeah, it's right all the way is gonna. Okay, so there was the royal
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:24.480]   That they announced and showed it. See yes, okay throw that out the samsung galaxy fold. Well, you know what happened there
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.200]   So now we're waiting this summer, uh, the third folding phone the wah way
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.920]   Which is a tri fold?
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.240]   Yes, do you think they'll get that out?
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:41.040]   So, okay, what I will say is that I think folding the other way is smarter than what the galaxy did actually right?
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.400]   So the galaxy like if this is the screen they folded this way
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:50.320]   Whereas the wall is going that way. Yeah, and I think like just physically with the physics that you're working with
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:55.120]   Folding over itself having the screen folder itself is better than having it fold in
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.240]   I just think that's a better model
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:04.160]   There's definitely I think that's gonna be the fun part to see which this is just like the early days when mark itself was
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.120]   Trying to get transforming devices on the market to in once
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:14.400]   Uh, we saw so many weird creations. We had screens that flipped around and spun around and so that was sort of fun to see
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.840]   Which is the best design and there will be a couple of these on the market. Well, some will work some won't
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.160]   Uh, there's definitely trade-offs at the wah way one. It's
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.400]   And you mentioned it's luise like they're not glass screens they're plastic screens
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.880]   So they're way more prone to scratching and so when you have the screen now on the outside and you put it in your pocket
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.880]   Like how is that last in six months?
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:39.200]   Um, these are solvable problems like we'll figure this stuff out, but uh, this technology is definitely here to stay
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.200]   It's just going to take a few years for us to
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.080]   For price to come down and to see what consumers enjoy as soon as we get settled with that
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.320]   Someone's gonna come out with a trifold device like three screens
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:52.880]   I could see people trying to innovate, you know, because
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.840]   I'm tired of the the same old what do you call them candy bar?
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:02.480]   I want the hank brag. I want a screen that you fold up like a hankerchief
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:07.760]   And they just don't fold it and then it's a big screen. That's what I want the hanker phones
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.800]   Yes, can we get that?
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:16.480]   Yeah, I just think I we got to give it to these companies. That's easy to make fun of Samsung for what happened with the fold
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.480]   but I will say like
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.480]   Yeah, I felt bad for them too, but I I
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.360]   Give them a lot more credit
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:28.640]   Then I do apple when you know the batteries are dying like I think that
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.920]   They're really innovating or trying something
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:36.160]   Yeah versus like oh these batteries like died on purpose
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.440]   You know what I mean? Like that kind of thing like it's like hardware is really hard
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:42.000]   And I feel like you got to get these companies a lot of credit when they're trying
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.320]   But i'm not going to give you credit when you're doing something. That's just shady or stupid
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.480]   But this is like I think actually really interesting
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:55.120]   It is. I mean and we're going to see this beyond phones soon. I'm just going to say that
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:59.840]   I don't think the tech will be ready till next year, but we're going to start to see this
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.880]   What are you saying? What are you saying? What do you know?
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:06.000]   I think he's going to bar go. I think that's what he's got. I think he's going to say
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.240]   Beyond phones. What refrigerators. What are you talking about?
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:14.160]   Yeah, it's refrigerators. I want a folding refrigerator. Yes, it pops out now
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.560]   But this stuff I think is really interesting because it does open up new thought scenarios
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.000]   I mean there there is this issue in computing which is where we're kind of
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.520]   We're all over the place like if you remember smartphones years ago
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:27.520]   We had the flip phone. It was the motor eraser
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:32.720]   It was how thin and small things could get right and then I keep telling people years ago
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.400]   I had the HTC Titan what a massive sounding phone. It's a Titan. It was a 4.7 inch display
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.400]   That was what was huge back then. I now have over there
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.000]   I have the Mate 20 act. It's a 7.2 inch jealous
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.320]   Yeah, that thing is just it's huge
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.640]   And so but there's obviously trade-offs for that right?
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:55.040]   It doesn't fit and you'll love this Leo. It doesn't fit in my Tesla the model three
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.320]   Doesn't fit?
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.720]   Yeah, cell phone holder the tray. It's too tall
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.000]   So I can't it's like
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.680]   But we're trying to figure out this balance between we want a smartphone and we want large screens
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.640]   But we know I assure you most people do not want to put 7.2 inches of screen in their pocket
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.720]   So foldables are definitely a way to sort of solve this
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.760]   It's interesting that all of the problems are around UI
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.400]   Yeah, we've got we've got the innards of these things pretty well worked out
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.760]   The problems are in and that's why you have voice assistance
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.280]   That's why you have photable screens
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.880]   That's why you have all of these because it's a UI issue because humans
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:37.920]   Like the apple watcher these watches they're too small. You really can't make a good UI on a
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.960]   device that's 44 millimeters in size
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.640]   Yeah, humans have certain needs we got fingers we got eyes we get and so that's the problem
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:51.600]   Is how do we how do we get a user interface typing is always the worst when it's all yeah?
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:57.280]   Yeah, I think like wearables too is just like not a big thing people want yet
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.560]   Like I think that I think we saw that with like Fitbit and all this stuff
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.480]   But there's only so much so many people who want to be like wearing something on their wrist like that
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.080]   Like the the smartphone is just the device. It's the one device and I think innovating beyond that is still really hard
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:14.080]   Yeah, we're both make wearables market them towards
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:23.200]   Other people that aren't just regular consumers marketed towards your sports teams and athletic departments that are doing research to help
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.280]   We know a lot of wearable marketing is going to the hearing aid
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.640]   Market as an old man. I see a lot of ads for for you know
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:37.440]   There's a company that makes hearing aids called starchy. They have a brand called the livio
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.000]   That has it's hearing aid, but it also has a heart rate monitor. It has a bunch of
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.680]   Wearables stuff in there that makes sense. It's in your ear. You might as well let it do some other things
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.760]   Yeah, I'm into like this. I've worked up like give me a chip like I miss that
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:54.240]   I feel like I'm definitely the minority
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.880]   No, I've been a lot that
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:01.440]   I had this great conversation other day about this like right now we look at like when you like prosthetics
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.640]   I find super interesting because prosthetics used to be just these horrible
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:10.000]   It's a plastic thing that just sits there now. We're getting into actual robotics and connecting to nerves and it can control
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.280]   But like you take this further than the down the road
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:18.640]   There's going to be a time where your prosthetic is more advanced than the human arm
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.520]   And that'll happen for vision too, right?
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.800]   Well, people will be able to have you know, macular degeneration will be able to get like a simulated probiotic eye or something
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:33.120]   And women's now if it allows you to see in different spectrums like there's all this potential that will eventually happen
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:37.280]   And then I guarantee you will be having this discussion because people will want to then
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:41.520]   Replace their limbs and stuff like that with an augmented system
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:48.640]   And this is where the cyborg stuff gets really fascinating because I 100% believe that humans will go down this path and want to go down this path
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:52.960]   So the google glass guys will be laughing
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:44:01.200]   Louise you said you wanted a chip, but you don't want the google home in your house
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.200]   Yeah
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.800]   Gotta come from either mics up for apple
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:11.200]   Yeah, I want to engineer my own ship to be fair
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:15.760]   I don't want a microphone in my chip. Yeah, but I have a Linux chip and I don't want I don't want a microphone in it
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.160]   I just want something simple like it'd be fun to like get into the office building just with my hand
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:23.920]   Like I'm cool with that kind of thing like I think there's some fun chip uses that
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.560]   I like like the like you could have art in them like I think that that's interesting
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.560]   But no, I don't I don't want a listening device
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:37.760]   Let's take a little break. What a great panel. It's so fun to have you Louise Misaka's you got to come back more often with you're just great
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:41.440]   Staff writer and wired we love having you. We're not done. Don't go away
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:47.040]   I'm just putting I'm putting a little hello in the middle exactly
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:53.080]   Aunt Pruitt we love always love having him on aunt Pruitt's youtube channel is youtube.com/ant
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.080]   A nt p r u i t
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.960]   Catch him anytime and of course
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.600]   Daniel Robino he's executive editor at windows central gearing up for a big
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.480]   Build conference startin tomorrow
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:12.240]   Yeah, our show today brought you by last pass if you're not using last pass all I can say is what why not?
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.920]   If you have passwords in your life, you need a password manager and if you need a password manager
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:21.280]   There's none better than last pass the number one
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:24.000]   most preferred password manager
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.640]   Last pass does everything right
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.960]   It is a password vault that is encrypted and only decrypted on your device
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:38.080]   So only you have access to it. It goes on every device you use windows mac
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:42.080]   Linux every browser android ios
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.760]   The first thing I install on any new device is last pass
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:49.920]   Because now I can log into everything else I can install all the other apps
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.360]   Last pass supports all the features you want
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:59.120]   Uh, there's a last pass for every kind of user we use it last pass enterprise here at twit
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.720]   Uh, because it gives us centralized control of our passwords
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.560]   You know one of the problems you have in a business is uh, you have to give employees passwords to kind of vital
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.400]   Things like databases bank accounts websites
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:19.200]   With last pass I can trust the employees with these passwords because for instance, they don't actually see the passwords
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.200]   I can share those passwords they click a link
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.000]   It opens it up logs in for them, but they never know what the password is
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.040]   We know employees share passwords and not just with people at work
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:34.240]   They put passwords on post-it notes. They make up bad passwords last pass enterprise gives us the cure for all of that
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:37.760]   And still makes it easy for them to get the job done
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:42.640]   Now we love last pass so much it's a benefit of working at twit every single one of our employees gets their own
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.840]   Personal last pass and of course I encourage them all to use that at home with last pass enterprise
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:54.320]   We can there's a hundred policies we can say what the you know minimum requirements for the master password
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.480]   We can require two factor which we do by the way last pass has two factor down
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:05.440]   We I use a ube key with my last pass you can use duo security google authenticator last pass even has its own authenticator app
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.520]   Which is does the thing I really like
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:14.240]   Instead of giving you a six digit code. It just pops up a approved deny on your phone makes it very easy again
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:20.960]   I love how last pass makes security simple and easy to use because if it's too hard to use people won't do it
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.880]   Last pass is a must for your business is a must for your home
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:30.000]   There's last pass teams for teams of 50 or fewer last pass premium for your personal use at home
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.920]   We use last pass families that way I can easily there's a folder a shared folder whenever I set up an account with something Lisa
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.000]   Needs access to I just put it in that shared folder. She immediately has access to it
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.320]   There's also a nice feature in last pass families
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.800]   I I you know, I hesitate to talk about this, but I think it's really important. It's called emergency access if I become
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:52.160]   Disabled or die
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:57.440]   Lisa can get access to the password so she can get into my bank accounts and a execute my will and do all that stuff
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:03.520]   I know we don't want to think about it, but that's just it's like it's the kind of little touches like that that make last pass really fantastic
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:09.680]   Last pass join the 13 and a half million people have signed up for last pass are loving it and trusting it including me
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:14.720]   I've been using it for a decade. We've been using it for years at twit to last pass.com/twit
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.680]   Find the last pass. That's right for you your business start securing your passwords
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:22.960]   Because you have to you don't want to be the next
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:26.160]   News story about the big breach last pass
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:28.400]   dot com slash
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.400]   Twit one more Apple story
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:35.200]   You know, there's a big fight going on about the right to repair our friends that I fix it
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:38.000]   Dot org or big, you know believers in the right to repair
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.960]   One of the companies fighting it is apple
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:46.560]   uh the latest an apple lobbyist brought an iPhone to meetings with california lawmakers and said
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.520]   The reason we don't want people fixing their phones they could hurt themselves
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:54.880]   You could hurt yourself
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.680]   Yeah, there's nothing like getting that that screwdriver wedged into your fingernail
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:06.880]   You could hurt you as well. They're worried about the lithium ion battery because the right to repair isn't about necessarily me opening up my phone
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.760]   It's about me being able to go to a third-party repair
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:15.680]   Facility that has manuals that has parts both of which are withheld by apple and I can get a repair
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:22.880]   Uh as a result of apple's lobbying the bill that was in front of the california assembly has been pulled
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:29.680]   Yeah, I think that this is actually this is really insidious and it's really funny to think of an apple lobbyist like running around with an
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.240]   iPhone open with like a finger cut a finger
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.200]   Cut on their finger what is that called paper cut on their finger? I guess it is a finger cut
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.400]   But that's not what I meant
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:43.360]   Uh, but I think the moron city's argument is that a lot of these companies will say that it's a security issue
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.640]   Right that
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.840]   Yeah, that like there's a cyber security risk in fixing your own item
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:52.000]   Your own electronic and that we're all going to get hacked if you release spare parts
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.560]   Apple use apple use that story in nebraska
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:59.360]   They told a lawmaker there the passing a right to repair bill would turn the state into a mecca
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:02.800]   For bad actors criminals and hackers
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.720]   I don't think that this argument's gonna last any longer. I think in the last couple of hours
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.440]   Well, we've been talking actually uh bernie sanders just
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:15.120]   Uh endorsed a national right to repair law. Elizabeth warren's done it too. The ftc is taking up the issues
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:21.200]   I think apple trying to scare these local lawmakers individual states is not going to keep working good. All right
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.880]   Good
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.360]   Can't you can only flex so much? Yeah
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.160]   Um, all right, so that was our last I think that was our last apple story
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.760]   And we got through all of them. Yes, we have
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.240]   um
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:41.280]   Google has uh
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.120]   Decided to allow you to auto delete your location
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:50.880]   Web activity and app usage. I think that's a good move in the right direction
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.600]   Yeah for sure
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:51:00.880]   Well, what was that was that story last summer where even if you turned off location tracking it actually wasn't turning off location tracking? Yeah, whoops
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:03.920]   so if you if you uh
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.480]   If you are worried about that
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:10.000]   Um, you can go into the google activity control settings
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.400]   Turn off the trackers and then there'll be a new auto delete option
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:21.280]   In which you can say uh after a period of time a week a month a year. I want you to automatically
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:27.200]   Delete that data. That's kind of the best of both worlds where you get the location history, but it's not kept forever
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:33.440]   Right, you can like look up the restaurant you went to last week, but then like, you know, it's not going to stay there for the rest of your life
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:38.800]   I've never had this on but have you guys ever looked back at this? It's like really crazy. Oh, I have it on. I love it
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:44.960]   I turned it off a while ago, but like you can like see literally like oh, uh, okay left my house
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.600]   But then I forgot my keys that day and I turned around and went back
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:53.360]   Like it's really crazy how like granular it is if you're like in a big enough house or building
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.000]   Sometimes you can even see like oh, I was in that room for a while
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.120]   Then I like moved to the other side of the house like I took the dog around the block
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:02.400]   Like it is really crazy how granular it is and I do think it is
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:05.440]   You know kind of problematic to have all that forever
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:08.560]   I enjoy using it
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:11.280]   Is that a dog?
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.760]   Is that a large decided to speak? Is the how do the basket bills in there? What's going on?
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:18.160]   Do you have it opinion about google location tracking?
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:30.160]   And so kylo had to greet her and that's all so if you go to google.com/maps/timeline
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.080]   If you're louise, you'll see nothing, but if you're me
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:41.360]   You'll see that and you can go to a specific year month and day. I can go back all the way to 2009
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.200]   I wonder what I was doing
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:45.200]   Oh, I was in australia apparently
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:50.720]   In 2009 I can and actually you can play the day back which is really fun
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:56.160]   And uh, and oh, I don't have it. Oh, you were there you fell off the map that day. That's yeah
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:59.920]   I was in the middle of the ocean probably it looks like that's where I was
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:03.920]   So that's I think that's a really a wonderful feature
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:10.640]   But it is really interesting to look at and and I do the look I do the local guide stuff
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:18.320]   Yeah, and it's nice to to help contribute to that because I depend on the local guides when I travel
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:22.320]   To see what's out there far as things that I can number one go eat
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:25.280]   And number two interesting spots to go shoot
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:31.280]   So I I here's an example. Yeah in 20 in 2015. I went from home to work
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:35.600]   But on the day before on febri 12th, I went all over the place
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:40.720]   When I went all over the here, I don't know I went down to a restaurant
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.760]   Uh, that's I think this is kind of cool
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:50.640]   I yes, it's definitely noticed by the way the pictures I took that day are showing up here too
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:54.800]   Yeah, I spent any I mean it's moving 5.4 miles
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:54:00.480]   This is crazy. Here's employees that no longer work here. It's nuts
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:08.000]   There is this tension between what we want this technology to do and what we're willing to give up to get to it
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.600]   Like there is no doubt about that being able to look at photos back
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:19.360]   You know a year ago or two years ago on a specific day is like really interesting because the problem now we have is there's too much information and data out there
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:23.440]   And there is this massive benefit. We mentioned talk about the ads before on instagram
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:26.560]   Like I joke about those but a lot of times those ads they're so good like
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:33.840]   That the technology has gotten to this point where they do know you and what you want and say when you're out for restaurants
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.960]   Right if it's it already knows like what you like these like you we do want these services
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:42.320]   But then the question is we get creeped out when you see, you know
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.600]   How the sausage is made so to speak right and how they're collecting all this data and going back there
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.640]   I think this option should have always been there and that's probably the case for almost all this technology with data collection
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.320]   Is like there always should be more tools it but this is also
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.920]   You have to go out there and enable it find it
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:05.360]   And they'll be more interesting if you set up your android phone if it's going to give you the option during the out-of-box experience
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:08.960]   To do that then i'll be a little bit more like okay now that they're doing the right thing
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:11.920]   We even just it would be nice if your phone popped up every once while like hey
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:15.520]   We have data for you for the last 10 years. Do you want us to hold on to all this?
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:19.280]   Um, I don't think they'll go down that route quite yet
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:22.560]   But that's what I think it'll take before this up is useful because right now
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:25.760]   I don't know how many people are going to know about this feature, right?
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.720]   This isn't something that or that I'm going to know how to go find it and that's going to be the problem here
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:33.200]   Is how useful this actually is for regular people
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:41.360]   So uh, there are at last count 20 democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential election
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:45.040]   That's 22 now 22 they keep going up. I can't even contact
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:50.080]   Anybody want to venture a guess how many of those 20 candidates have basic email security
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:53.360]   On their campaign email take a good
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:57.920]   One maybe one. Can you guess who it is?
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:00.960]   Elizabeth Warren
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:04.640]   Yeah, I would say Warren. Yeah, probably although she has that weird website
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:07.920]   That's like kind of like not very well designed. So I don't know maybe
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:08.880]   But
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:13.600]   Google's been handing out those ub keys to campaigns good and they've been doing yeah
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:16.560]   They've been doing campaign trainings. I'm gonna say maybe like eight
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.760]   That's like it's so Elizabeth Warren
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.760]   uh according to agari
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:29.040]   Is the only candidate republican or democratic that uses domain based message authentication reporting and conformancy?
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:35.680]   That's d mark. She also uses center policy framework spf and domain keys identified email dkim
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.840]   I use all three on my email
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:45.440]   Uh, and that way that helps from being spoofed, right? You can verify that she sent an email
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:47.920]   um, donald trump does not
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:50.560]   uh
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:54.560]   He has uh, he has that iphone seven. You love so much though. I think you know
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:57.920]   I just want to believe he uses hotmail hotmail
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:00.000]   And it's still hot
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.320]   Yeah, the press at hotmail.com. I'm guessing that's the email address
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.520]   Um, anyway, there is there are ways to do it better
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:15.200]   Um, and in fact sometimes I feel like uh, congress there is some hope ron wyden who is one of the more uh, uh, uh,
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.840]   techno literate senators
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:23.360]   Uh, called the roll out of d mark a no brainer that increases cyber security without sacrificing liberty
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:25.120]   Wow
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:27.120]   Thank you ron wyden
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:33.280]   Um, I just thought I throw that in there. Let's see uh, phone. Why didn't so homie. He's a homie's from organ, right?
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.280]   Yeah, yeah, why didn't school as far as tech goes at least. Yeah, one of the few
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:39.440]   One of the few yeah
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:45.680]   Here's a scary thought phone and laptop searches that the u.s border have quadrupled turns out you have zero rights
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:48.560]   If you're crossing the border whether you're a u.s. citizen or not
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:55.040]   Yeah, one day are they searching for i've been seeing a bunch of headlines like that here recently
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:58.560]   But I never dove into the details of it, you know
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:04.000]   What is the point of searching the cell phone of just a regular person coming through
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.200]   They're big cat fans and they want as many they want all the cat photos themselves, you know
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:15.120]   You say that fashiciously, but but I was told by somebody who repairs cars or maybe he was a
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:18.560]   Carve valet parker, but the he um
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.160]   That routinely when they would get keys they would look for usb keys
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:28.480]   Attached on the key ring and they would just copy whatever music was on there because it's a good way to get a lot of new music
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:30.480]   So maybe that's what they're looking for. Yeah
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.320]   Uh, it's very soft
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:38.560]   33,000 295 searches of travelers devices in the year 2018
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:44.400]   The carried out for a variety of reasons intelligence gathering tax enforcement
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:46.400]   and criminal investigations
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.560]   This is according to the eff and aclu
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:53.360]   They're suing saying these searches are often warrantless and therefore unconstitutional
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:56.000]   And they're targeted sometimes more there's some media
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.840]   Press people covering uh the border crisis who are traveling free clean to mexico coming back and they were
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:06.240]   Subject to more of these searches and detentions more than anybody else
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:12.640]   Yeah, I think what's really insidious about this is that what the definition the legal definition of a border is
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.560]   Can sometimes be up to 100 miles. Yeah, actual border crossings
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.360]   I think that that's really you know if you live in one of these border towns
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:22.720]   You just basically don't have the fourth amendment, which is really crazy. No kidding
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:27.440]   It's scary. And there's also the interest in being about security too because this isn't the case like
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:32.240]   If you're password like you're using a pin or a physical password
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:36.960]   You could claim you don't know the password and then this comes into this search and seizure
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:40.160]   Fourth amendment kind of thing about how they get that password
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:44.480]   Otherwise, I'm going to detain you for presumably a long time, which for me. I'm actually fine
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:48.000]   If anyone wasn't detained me for like a week. I'm just like that's a vacation, man
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.680]   but
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:56.960]   For this is where bio authentication comes into an issue because as we know the police have used people's fingers to unlock their phones or
[01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:00.640]   Facial recognition is hold it up to your face and boom it's unlocked
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:05.520]   So this is one of the tips when you know either whenever you're dealing with the police if you're knowing you're going to be doing some
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:08.880]   You know public protests or you're returning overseas
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:16.400]   It may be not a bad idea if you're concerned about this to disable your bio authentication and just rely on a pin system and just deny
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:20.880]   Um, I would also say a lot of modern computers today. We are living in a very cloud-based world
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.640]   I I'm
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:28.320]   Fairly comfortable with wiping my pc doing a fresh restart and bring it over to border and be like there's nothing on there
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:32.720]   It's out there and they're not gonna be able to necessarily get that it's bad in the us
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:38.880]   It's worse crossing into Canada. I've been told by many people. Here's an example. This is a story from today
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:46.400]   A lawyer's phone and laptop were seized by the Canadian border services because he wouldn't hand over the passwords
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:53.600]   Yeah, a big place for this happens actually is on the train on the m-track train that goes into Canada is a lot of people get their devices
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:57.600]   Sees there not just at the car border right that you when you drive over
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:04.160]   But yeah, I think that's a great advice is wiping your phone. Although they might want your cloud password, right? It's not that simple, but yeah, definitely
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:09.760]   Uh, you can't they can't force you to self incriminate. So they can't force you to give over your password
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:14.640]   However, they can force you to give over your biometric data, which can be your fingerprint or your face
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:17.840]   The courts are kind of undecided right now, but yeah, don't you face id on?
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.560]   If you're crossing over the border and don't really want your phone looked at but yeah, these device
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:29.040]   Seasures are definitely really troubling. Yeah, I mean in the us at least I think it's believed that they can't force you to you can't
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.280]   They can't say you have to give us a password
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:35.360]   They can hold you an airport jail for a little while but ultimately they have to let you go
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:38.480]   Apparently that's not the case in Canada. They could take your device and keep it
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.040]   And see i'm their formidable opponent here because I've reviewed laptops for a living
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.040]   I have a stack of laptops so they can see as many as they can
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.280]   I'll just come back to another one
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.280]   It is
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:54.400]   I believe and if I may I don't think i'm wrong here and you can correct me luis
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:56.880]   If once you've given a device
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:02.560]   To law enforcement and they take it out of your presence actually in this case they would keep it for weeks and then mail it back to you
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:05.520]   You should not use that device ever again, right?
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:11.760]   Yeah, I mean it's kind of hard if you're a marginalized group and you can't just go out and buy another device, right?
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:20.800]   But I would recommend if you can you know using the resources to get it get it looked at but they shouldn't be able to put a tracking device or anything on that without
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:21.840]   um
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.840]   you know warrant
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:26.960]   But so far yeah, it hasn't happened to me
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:32.160]   Because i'm a little white man and i don't look like trouble, but if you're Daniel Rubino, I'd be very careful
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:37.600]   And i'm sure they can have facial hair when i travel yeah, it's the facial hair and you should never leave the country ant because
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:43.120]   Pretty much yeah, you you look scary you really do ants boss. He's scary
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:45.280]   Um
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:49.040]   video game hall of fame. I know this is we're just we're at the bottom of the barrel now
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.120]   He's just short little slits
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:55.280]   I like it bring the fun news the fun news video game hall of fame inducting
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.840]   Super mario cart
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:59.840]   That's probably from your generation
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:02.240]   Mortal combat a classic arcade game
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:06.560]   Something from my generation colossal cave adventure
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.840]   That was a text adventure. I spent a lot of time on copy serve hundreds of hours playing
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:15.360]   And but my favorite is microsoft solitaire
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:20.640]   This is so random to me. I mean microsoft solitaire incredible game but putting that in the same like
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.160]   I don't know hall as the same like group as mario cart
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:29.360]   I don't know. I feel like they I feel like they asked the video game of hall hall of fame's staff like guys
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.440]   Which are favorite game that's not in
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.080]   The hall of babe yet, right? Like this just seems random, but i'm happy about it. I feel like all well deserved
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:40.640]   Solitaire don't know how to play solitaire
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:45.440]   No, I just it look boring. I would always boring. It's definitely boring
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:49.920]   Hintball 3d was by jam. Oh love pinball 3d that'll get in next year
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:54.000]   I'm sure good news though. They considered and rejected candy criss saga
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.680]   Hello, oh yeah, but they also rejected civilization
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:04.560]   And half life which should easily be in the hall of fame. I guess you know they get around to that next time
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.800]   What are you playing right now? Are you playing anything right now?
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:09.440]   Uh, I hate to admit what i'm playing right now
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:12.480]   Pokemon go
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:16.800]   Wow, that's like there's what three years a little late on that but I respect it
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.800]   I'm almost level 40 after that
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:24.160]   I'm quitting forever and then harry potters coming out any day now and that's what i'm gonna
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:27.600]   That'll be my jam as these are wholesome choices. I like this
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:31.040]   Well, I don't know about you, so but you do have to at least walk around to play it
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:32.480]   Right, right?
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:36.240]   No, sit on your butt. What am I playing on the desktop? Uh
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:41.440]   But that's a good question. I don't I don't have anything i'm really crazy about right now
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:45.680]   I feel I used to have always have a game. What's your game luis?
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:05:04.160]   Uh, I haven't played I actually met at the mario cart for uh the switch my way
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:09.680]   That game ever yeah, there was a lot of there was a lot of tears in my home, but he did finish it
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:12.080]   Oh my god. That's very impressive
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:19.520]   You can tell him I was very impressed by that because that's that game. I've got like the two levels
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:23.520]   It's the hardest game ever. Yeah, it's really beautiful though. I love it. I love it
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:28.720]   I hope more games like stick with that kind of innovative design because it's just like really fun
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.480]   The music's really fun
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:36.400]   My 16 year old and his friend beat it. Oh, I know what I still play minecraft speaking of teenagers
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:42.880]   I actually really like minecraft. I have a server in the house. We have four different worlds. It's fun
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:46.800]   Yeah, minecraft school. I just upgraded to 1.14
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:50.880]   They added panda bears. You can hatch a panda bear now. That's good
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:54.080]   And since they had a panda bears they added bambooz. So you can feed them
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:56.720]   What are you playing dandruff? You play games at all?
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:06:01.920]   I do now as much as I'd like to I literally have to try to schedule myself to play video games
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:04.240]   I still hit destiny two every once in a while
[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:09.600]   It's just I that was a great game. That was a great. Yeah, I'm just a fan of that series
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.800]   You know minecraft. I try to do once a while minecraft
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:15.120]   Fascinates me
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:17.680]   Because I just go down. Yeah, chop chop chop chop chop
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:22.480]   It's such a bizarre game. I do have a switch. I don't play it nearly as much as I should
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:27.760]   but it's uh, I'm more interested in sort of the indie games that are available on the switch than
[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:33.280]   necessarily the mario games, which are always like 65 bucks or 60 bucks is always so expensive
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:39.280]   Versus like the five or ten dollar steam type games which for me is always that's where you get to some of the real creativity
[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:42.480]   I find on the switch why I thought such an interesting system
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:49.520]   If you look at the indie games, it's just a lot going on there right now and be able to throw that as five or ten bucks for
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:52.560]   Even smaller games. Sometimes I think it's really fun experience
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:56.560]   Switch is cool. I think the games are really fun. I think Nintendo did a good job
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:59.280]   Yeah, I tried
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:05.600]   What was that called Zelda breaking wind or something? Yeah, I tried that too. I couldn't get into it's a little too much game
[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:09.120]   It's been a lot of time walking around
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:15.200]   It's so beautiful. That's what it's called. I think it's something like that
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:19.200]   And do you play video games? You don't look like a video game type
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:24.080]   When I'm out on the photo walk, I do play this game called untapped
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:27.760]   Oh, yeah, it basically shows me all the micro breweries
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:30.640]   Get beer. Yeah. Yeah
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:37.040]   Yeah, it's great. Yeah, it's like the LinkedIn for drinkers for drunks. Yeah
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:42.000]   You write your beers you get you know, you you collect all the beers
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:48.880]   It's very joe fully his favorite game. I believe. Oh, she loves it. Yeah. It's actually it's actually it's really more like four square for drunks
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.440]   It's yeah, I would
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:56.000]   I was showing my friend. I was like look at this. I got 364 unique beers
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:01.200]   I've checked in. I was like not bad right he had he's like he chose me his there's over 3000
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:06.480]   Yeah, what's he oh yeah, and he's like oh, I knew the developer. I actually helped him
[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:09.760]   Make parts of the app. He says like he helped with the
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:15.520]   Dispel checking and all this kind of stuff and I was just like oh you're that guy because he's an editor
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:20.000]   Spell checking beer is tough especially when you get to the the belgian and yeah
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.880]   Yeah, just like that one cray cray. All right. Let's take one more break. I have a couple more stories
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:28.560]   I do want to mention our fan our friends at elassee and i'm a big fan
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:34.720]   We are in elassee in house if you know jeera and I think most programmers are very familiar with jeera

[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:57.200]   It ties in of course with confluence because and this is something I really want to emphasize
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:58.720]   uh
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:02.480]   Communication it is is is a big part of the game when you're an it department

[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:56.800]   We know where they stand if you've got a code base you need bit bucket

[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:14.880]   With python they raised 200 million dollars in venture capital capital and last monday
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:20.640]   People came to work and uh, they were told your last day is wednesday 200 employees
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:23.600]   one week of severance
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:25.600]   boom like a crash
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:29.440]   very sad nephalos nephalos gebo another
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:33.920]   Oh, I have a gebo on the shelf here. What an idiot. I am he's dead now
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:39.760]   Yeah, yeah, we kind of had a little party. We talked to it for the last time said bye. Bye gebo. It's saying
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:44.240]   Do
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:45.840]   Stopped working
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:50.720]   Very sad. What was that other that was like a thousand dollar robot that is now going to break itself
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:53.200]   Oh, no
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:55.840]   Was that gebo or
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:58.240]   Gebo
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:02.880]   I just it's very sad when we plugged it in, you know, it looks around and has eyes it goes
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:06.000]   it was created by
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.400]   MIT yeah, and
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:15.520]   Cheers who was a really smart roboticist the whole idea was this thing would sit on your kitchen counter, you know
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:20.560]   I bought it on the kickstarter. I'm an idiot and it came like two years later
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:25.600]   And the thing that really went wrong with gebo is it would um snore
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:27.760]   so
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:30.880]   So you'd put this on your counter and if you didn't talk to it
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.360]   It would just kind of look around and then it would start like murmuring to itself and snoring
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:38.480]   And it was like oh stop that
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:40.320]   You're like feel that
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:41.600]   Is it you're annoying?
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:46.320]   Well, that's the idea see it has like two eyes and it had this it would make faces and it had eyeballs
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:51.280]   I understand what they were where they were going with it, but this is the problem. It doesn't do anything
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:53.840]   Yep, the only thing it is it
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:56.880]   As I can say, there's a problem with AI in general right now as consumers
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:03.840]   We don't really see the complete advantage although like google is doing I think an interesting example of like the callback features and how can screen your calls
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:09.680]   That's a real world example of how this tech will eventually, you know, make our lives better or at least more interesting
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:15.680]   Um, but yeah right now these products and then they're started by companies who didn't take VC money and you know again
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:19.680]   I I've probably taken how much VC money. I get it. It's like yeah
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:23.680]   That's how you grow and you need to do that, but they're so beautiful as soon as you know
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.600]   Something goes wrong. All right. So off the company lay off everybody, right? It's your
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:35.200]   You don't these companies don't get the chance to grow like a normal company would by putting a product out there and baby steps
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:41.840]   It's all about hyper growth right away and how you're gonna triple and quadruple your results next quarter and it's unfortunate
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:44.000]   We're losing you know some of these, you know
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.680]   That vector thing the little bulldozer guy who was adorable. I saw it on twitter. Oh, it was really a cool toy
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:55.280]   But it was $200 and I think they also discovered that there isn't a big market for $200 kids toys
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:14:03.280]   Something's wrong with the economy where a little robot can get $200 million and all of these really great ideas that are maybe not in silicon
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:06.000]   Valley can't get any money and also screw raising
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:10.160]   $200 million and then giving your employees only one week severance that
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:15.760]   Really and they were their revenue was 100 million. I think a year so that wasn't like they weren't
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:17.200]   selling them
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:21.120]   It feels like uh, we were talking about this on wednesday. I feels like
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:25.840]   Somebody pulled out they were expecting funding from somebody and they said no
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:30.080]   Yeah, and that that was it your colleague jeffree van camp
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:34.080]   Wrote a very funny piece about jebo dying last month. Yeah
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:40.400]   He had actually personified this thing and he said it was kind of like alzheimer's like dementia
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:44.800]   Oh my god, that's what you did do is personify those devices. Yeah
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:50.160]   He said my jebo talked to the wall again today. He's been doing that a lot lately
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:54.000]   Some days i'll watch him carry on an entire conversation by himself
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:01.360]   He'll ask the wall if it wants to play a game. Listen for a reply hear nothing then play his word definition game alone
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:06.000]   Every so often he'll wake up in the middle of the night and make strange beeping noises
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.720]   Like an invisible person is swiping his screen
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:15.200]   He's taking longer and longer to respond to simple questions and randomly forgetting how to perform common tasks
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:17.200]   It sounds like my obituary
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:21.440]   Some days he even forgets how to do something as simple as tell me the news
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:24.880]   More than once jeebo's got entirely limp
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:32.000]   For jebo look is this the definition of limp? This thing's got nothing
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:37.040]   Family show works. Yeah, this isn't the interesting thing with robotics and ai though
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:39.920]   It's like it doesn't take much to trigger human empathy
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:44.640]   And gain this like connection with something in fact just we were you know
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:49.360]   There's this thing called facial agnosia people get brain damage and they lose ability to recognize faces
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:54.000]   But the human brain is what we learned from that was it's literally wired to recognize faces
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.480]   Which is why people see jesus and toast or we find bugs that look like they have a face on them
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:02.320]   So intriguing and so as soon as you just add eyes to something that talks to you
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:07.360]   It becomes a little bit more real and starts breaking down those barriers and this is going to happen more and more
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:10.160]   And you're going to start to see weird psychosis things by the way
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:12.560]   I'm just going to give a shout out this a really hilarious video
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:15.200]   Probably not appropriate for this podcast
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:21.840]   Someone adding screams to a rumba where every time it bumped into a wall instead of he said that it's unnatural
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:25.520]   If you were to bump into the wall you'd be really upset so he added screams and swearing to it
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:29.280]   Yeah
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:31.280]   What are you talking about?
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:33.760]   Language i don't know the language, but if you want to
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:38.960]   Honestly, daniel my rumba or whatever my knockoff rumba his name is debot
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.600]   He makes the most annoying sound when he gets like stuck on the carpet. I would much rather
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:48.320]   He was like help help like f-word like I would much rather prefer that
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:58.160]   This isn't it. I think he's actually built it into the rumba software
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:02.000]   All right, there's another one. There's more than one
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:06.720]   I hate my rumba so much it wakes up in the middle of the night. It makes a lot of noise
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:12.000]   Michael read my career is screaming rumba at Michael
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.960]   His channel is pretty hilarious
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:30.240]   Honestly, I feel like this isn't a stretch. This is kind of what a rumba
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:32.720]   I
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:38.320]   Is a big racket and then our rumba gets stuck under furniture and i'm in i wake up and i hear
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:43.360]   As it's trying trying to get out of the
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:47.200]   Furniture's i have to pick it up one night finally I picked it up
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:51.520]   I confess I brought it into the garage. I put it under the tires of my wife's car
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:55.360]   Oh
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:57.680]   That's not very nice rumba didn't like that
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:01.600]   My wife didn't like it either. She really likes that room, but I feel bad
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:04.480]   That escalated fast
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:06.320]   Inserted here
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:12.080]   For rice and talk about moribund products for rise and has decided yeah, this tumbler thing is not going to work out
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:14.640]   They bought tumbler as part of that all big yahoo
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:19.600]   Thing then they then they last month the month before decided no more porn on tumbler
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.560]   What a surprise people stopped using it
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:29.040]   So now verisans trying to sell tumbler guess who wants to buy it
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:34.400]   Porn hob porn hub they say we'll bring back the porn
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:41.280]   Right, but is this just a marketing stunt did did buzzfeed or whoever broke the story just asked porn hub like or
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:47.760]   Like that's what i'm wondering is like are they really interested porn hub vp kori price told buzzfeed news his company is quote extremely
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:54.480]   Interested in buying tumbler and very much looking forward to one day restoring it to its former glory with nsc
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:56.480]   Fw content
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:05.120]   Can you think of like anything more just topian and then like what was once a wholesome beautiful platform like particular for women like teenage girls
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:06.640]   tumbler
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:10.240]   Yeah, it's a post like really awesome stuff to then to then be bought by a porn company
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:16.720]   Ever being sold by verizon like so sad it was so easy. It was a you know, david carpy really was a brilliant thing
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:21.040]   He created that made it simple for anybody to have a website. I bet you had a tumbler
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:26.960]   I had a tumbler. I thought so so did I of course it was called tumbolio and I even had
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:32.720]   tumbolio.com and i leo tumbler.com and I can't tell you how many people try to get that name saying
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:36.240]   Are you gonna use that are you using it or can I have it? Do you want it? Do you need it?
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:38.960]   But I killed it after
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:41.280]   After verizon bought it and what I made it do with it
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:44.320]   Yeah, that's another company that just couldn't
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:47.200]   Be allowed to exist and just be a thing
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:51.920]   It always had to be achieving something else and these market pressures are just I think
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:58.560]   Strangling a lot of good products that I can't compete in this super, you know, weird world we're in right now
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:07.040]   Now karstin. I think karstin you liked detective pikachu. You're like the furry pikachu. Am I right? I'm I'm actually taking
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:13.120]   Two carloads full of teenage boys to the drive in to see it next friday. Perfect place to see it
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:17.920]   Where is a drive-in in conquered in conquered the last drive-in in america
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:22.880]   In the bay area actually I think there's one in the south bay. How do you feel in massachusetts?
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:26.560]   How do you feel about a couple near me the sonic the hedgehog?
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:34.000]   Um, I like the really disturbing with fire. This is a furry sonic the hedgehog
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.720]   and um
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:39.040]   There's considerable upset over the whole thing
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:48.080]   That's uh, jim kara is dr. Robotnik. Um, I like that the director posted these images
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:55.040]   He said after massive twitter outrage. There's three words you don't hear together very often
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:21:02.320]   I said sardonically. Uh, he said, okay, um, maybe we will change this the message is loud and clear
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:05.280]   You're not happy with the design and you want changes. It's going to happen
[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:08.480]   I think rightly so
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:10.560]   It's one thing to have a furry pikachu
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:14.320]   Another thing to have a furice. Oh, it's terrifying
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:17.280]   Terrifying
[02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:18.560]   Um
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:23.600]   Live-action sonic is the world ready for it. Yeah, and here's a good use for technology
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:27.520]   Let's put five medanas on stage at the same time
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:35.280]   This is augmented reality. This is I did not see the billboard music awards. I don't know. Maybe some of you did
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:42.000]   Nook. Nope. Somehow they managed to get not one not two but five medanas on the Las Vegas
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.480]   I think I was watching ice melt that night stage
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:49.840]   I actually like medana went to seer. Uh, we flew to denver just to seer
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:54.000]   But even I I don't know if I want five medanas on stage
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:01.840]   Uh, oh and a kind of a weird story friday all firefox extensions stopped working
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:10.480]   Weirdly firefox, I guess forgot to renew their code signing certificate. It expired
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:13.280]   after five pm pacific on uh,
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:16.720]   A friday night and everybody using firefox
[02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:19.520]   Right the extensions stopped just stop working
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:23.520]   And it gave you a weird. No, it gave you a weird message. Right? What did it say?
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:30.160]   Okay, we got some oh you right externs. So one of our audience members writes extensions
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:33.840]   And you got a lot of support emails. I bet you did what's going on
[02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:37.680]   Well, what'd you do Dan? What'd you do? Did you break it huh? Did you break it?
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:41.280]   My thoughts is big enough to stay on top of that though, right? What would think
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:46.960]   Uh, so they did immediately send out an updated I guess an updated certificate
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:51.520]   Uh, I think on saturday for the desktop, but there are still problems with some of the mobile
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:55.040]   Versions of firefox are you still getting uh support emails Dan?
[02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:57.440]   I was checking his phone
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:00.560]   That's kind of that's kind of scary
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:04.000]   Huh
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000]   Nine support emails
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.240]   Firefox said there do not do any of the workarounds
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:12.960]   Do not
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:20.480]   Apparently they will reduce the uh safety of using firefox you should just hang in there and you'll get an update automatically
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:23.040]   if your firefox
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:25.200]   extensions aren't working
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:30.800]   It's kind of a statement in a chat room says they just had they got theirs working again
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:38.000]   But he had to restore 20,000 files from his backup rocket 88 in the chat room. Oh what else?
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:43.120]   That's cray cray. Yeah, you'd think there'd be somebody just keeping an eye on that certificate
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:46.800]   Hey, you know, it's gonna inspire a little reminder calendar reminder

[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:40.720]   They're giving us an option. We were actually here at build which I thought it was wow in the new microsoft
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:45.920]   There is a lot of overlap for instance. I'm sure microsoft will talk about progressive web apps as will google, right?
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:51.440]   Yep. Yeah, I expect that definitely there competitors in the cloud, but there are definitely areas of overlap
