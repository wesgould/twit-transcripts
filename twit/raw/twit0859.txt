[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech to vendor Hardawars here, Dwight Silverman, Microsoft's
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.400]   biggest acquisition ever, but will the feds allow them to buy Activision Blizzard?
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.280]   The IRS is going to require face ID if you want to use their site.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.520]   I can't wait to see how people react to that.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.400]   And should you take your smartphone to the Beijing Olympics?
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.600]   Security experts say no way.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.560]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:22.160]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech to show we cover the tech snooze of the week.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.120]   I don't mean to say it's tech snooze.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.840]   It might be, not this week actually, nothing to snooze over.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.920]   Twit Silverman is here, formerly of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.560]   Now, all over the place, but you can find all his work at Authorie, A-U-T-H-O-R-Y.com/D-Silverman.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.640]   Hello, Dwight.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   Hello, how are you?
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.560]   You're staying very busy in retirement.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.000]   Yes, well, I'm kind of...
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.920]   I'm still...
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.040]   My column has returned at the Chronicle weekly.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.160]   And so that's kind of my primary gig.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.320]   And occasionally I've been doing standalone stories for them.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.200]   But for the most part, I'm just enjoying kicking back and not doing all that much.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.400]   And contributing to us.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.640]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.080]   Love to have you on.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.480]   Also with us, another regular we love to see, Devindra Hardewar, senior editor at Engadget.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.960]   And host of the film cast, hi, Devindra.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.320]   Hello, happy to be here.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.520]   What a week to be here too.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.280]   I thought I was going to be a sleepy week, but...
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.080]   No.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.960]   No snoozing in this text snooze this week.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   And we did have...
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.960]   I'm sorry to say we had Brianna Wu scheduled, both last week and this week.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.080]   Brianna had nodes in her throat operated on and she still sounds really gravelly.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.480]   She wanted to join us.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.440]   And I said, no, I want you to rest.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.560]   So we'll get her back on.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.400]   This would have been a good week to have Brianna's take because the big story, of course, Microsoft
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:53.320]   making its biggest acquisition ever bigger than LinkedIn, $68.7 billion to buy Activision
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.680]   Blizzard.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.840]   And I'm sure Brianna would have had lots to say.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.960]   Of course, Blizzard Activision has been under the spotlight lately for the harassment and
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.320]   the kind of the boys club.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.520]   It was interesting because so in way Microsoft is too, they've just agreed to
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.120]   have an investigation of how they've treated harassment cases in the past,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.240]   including the Bill Gates' harassment case.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:25.640]   So is it two boys clubs joining or is it a chase in Microsoft saying,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.840]   we're going to do the right thing and we're going to clean up Activision?
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.240]   What do you think, Devendra?
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.120]   First of all, is Bobby Kotik going to stay or no?
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.960]   I think that's the big question for a lot of people, right?
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.720]   I've spent the past year charting all the stories around Activision and
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.360]   basically how Bobby Kotik fostered this company that was not a great institution when it came to
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.000]   women and harassment and things like that.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.400]   It wasn't a great place for a lot of people.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.800]   The story now is that at least what Microsoft is saying is that he's going to stay on,
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.200]   you know, if this merger goes through, he's going to stay on.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.680]   But then there was additional reporting after this was announced where people were like
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.360]   under the table just telling a WSD and others, I think.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.320]   He's out.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.760]   He's going to be out.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.120]   But with the big, you know, multi-million dollar parachute.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.280]   Yeah, he's a huge share.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.120]   So Kotik joined.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.280]   I didn't realize this in '91.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.160]   He's been there since '19.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.600]   That's almost 40.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.400]   What is it?
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.080]   38, 9, 40 years.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.120]   What is it?
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.480]   I can buy maths terrible.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.720]   No, no.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.600]   29 years.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.400]   I'm not 40 yet.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.120]   I'm almost there.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.320]   91 plus two carry the four.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.480]   Anyway, a long time, almost 30 years.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.040]   A little more than 30 years.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.280]   And he's actually taken Activision to new heights.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.680]   He's been a, he really took a company that was dying, going almost bankrupt and turned it into a
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.200]   gaming behemoth.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.760]   But at the same time, he's also 100.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.480]   I'll look at this article from a few months ago in the Washington Post.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.600]   Over 100 Activision Blizzard employees stage walkout.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.360]   Demand CEO steps down.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.920]   Maybe this had something to do with the sale, to be honest with you.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.960]   Maybe CODEC said, "I'm going to cash out."
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.560]   Certainly one of the reasons Microsoft was able to buy it
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.320]   is the stock price it tumbled over the last year because of--
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.280]   It was a strange situation.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.360]   That's the thing, as we were reporting this, the board of Activision was fully on his side.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.720]   They fully supported him because he's made them a lot of money.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.280]   He made Activision and shareholders a lot of money.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.000]   So nobody's going to out there basically for the past few decades, like CODEC has created
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.080]   that company and turned it into a behemoth.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.240]   This is probably the best possible solution where he gets out, the company can start fresh
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.960]   somewhere else.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.200]   And he faces no consequences because that's the way business works in America.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.560]   Here's another story from IGN.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.800]   Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotik reportedly turned up late and left early.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.600]   From a fireside chat meeting that was meant to reassure employees of Activision Blizzard about
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.320]   their future.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.800]   A fireside chat that was supposed to last half an hour, 16 minutes after Kotik himself turned
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.600]   up seven minutes late and finished early, I think he's on his way out.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.480]   I think he's taken the big payoff.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:30.040]   And Microsoft probably solidifying its position as a gaming company.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.240]   They just bought Bethesda.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.480]   They have Minecraft.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.360]   This is huge.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.920]   This is huge.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.360]   And by the way, they don't just get call of duty and and and more of the Warcraft.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.480]   They get king.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.920]   They get candy crush.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.640]   This is a gaming behemoth.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.600]   They also get mobile.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.720]   There's mobile call of duty.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.880]   There's obviously king is mostly mobile.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.480]   So this is a really good way for Microsoft to position itself in the gaming industry.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:02.040]   Shares of Sony, makers of the PlayStation 5, tumbled $20 billion when this news came out
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.880]   because of the fear that they Microsoft would make all of these money makers for Sony.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.840]   Xbox exclusives Microsoft.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.480]   Got a hedged its bets on that one.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.920]   No, we wouldn't.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.120]   We'll adhere to all existing deals.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:25.800]   Well, and at the same time that this on the same day that this news broke,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.240]   we also heard that the Justice Department is reorganizing so it could get tougher on tech
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.200]   company burgers.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.520]   This has to get through regulatory scrutiny.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.160]   Yes.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:37.480]   Yes.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:43.640]   And I suspect that it's not going to get through regulatory scrutiny until there are iron
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.760]   clad agreements or at least as best as you could get them that Microsoft won't take all these
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.520]   and make them Xbox exclusives.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.960]   And actually, Microsoft's current point of view seems to be the more platforms the
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.680]   merrier. And that's exactly what Satya Nadella does.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.920]   His first act as CEO was to announce Microsoft Office for the iPad,
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:15.000]   which is very kind of sacrilegious in Microsoft at the time.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.480]   And Microsoft once, as you mentioned, there's all these mobile games on here.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.120]   Microsoft really doesn't have a mobile platform.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.280]   No, this is this iPad.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.040]   And Android to a certain extent.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:36.120]   And so it'll give them, you know, I don't see this stuff going under Xbox umbrella.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.640]   The only thing is, of course, is that there's been this constant cliche of the Netflix of games
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.200]   that that's what everybody is headed to.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.360]   And it could be that Microsoft just makes it easier to do these games on any Microsoft
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.160]   platform that that could be the video.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.480]   Let's address this regulatory issue.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.600]   Microsoft says, this acquisition makes us the number three gaming company in the world,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.800]   not even number one.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.320]   Obviously, that's a defensive statement, right?
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.920]   We're not a monopoly.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.960]   We're still so small.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.720]   We're a little guy.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.680]   We're just a little weird.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.360]   We're an indie studio.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:12.920]   But you're right.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.680]   This is not the climate right now.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.880]   I mean, the FTC and the DOJ, and we'll get to this in a little bit, but they're starting to say,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.760]   well, what does monopoly mean in the modern age?
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:29.640]   And what should we, I think there's a lot of regret about not stopping the, what's happened,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.320]   Instagram acquisitions by Facebook.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.680]   And I think that there may be that there will be additional scrutiny that you can count on that
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.160]   of this.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.440]   On the other hand, yeah, doesn't make Microsoft number one, 10 cents is bigger.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.800]   They're China.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.000]   10 cents is number one.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.840]   Yeah, 10 cents is number one.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.520]   And so he's still number two.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.400]   So it is number two.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.160]   So, I mean, I don't know, it really depends what the rules are these days.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.840]   And that seems to be a shifting playground.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.680]   Bobby Conak himself gave an interview with Gamesbeat.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.400]   And they asked him, why do the deal?
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.600]   Why is this a good time to sell?
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.200]   Why is it a good price?
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.800]   I got to go.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.280]   I got to go.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:12.600]   Guys.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.640]   To which Bobby said, what are you crazy?
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.680]   No, he said, yeah.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.200]   It's interesting.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.920]   He said, as you look at the increased competition between 10 cent, net ease.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.600]   I'm not sure who that is.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.800]   Sony.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.200]   And now you have Google and Amazon and Apple and Facebook and Microsoft and Netflix,
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.560]   which is interesting because they're getting into gaming too.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.480]   We were looking at over the course of the next couple of years starting to realize,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.800]   in order to execute our future plans, we needed thousands of new people.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.520]   That's interesting.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:50.440]   We need them in disciplines like AI, machine learning, data analytics, cloud, cybersecurity.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.040]   They're people we don't have.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.680]   And the competition for that talent is really expensive.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.440]   We started to see that now where Apple's offering big bonuses.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.600]   If you don't get a leave to get a job somewhere else, engineering talent is hard to come by.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.640]   Conak says that.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.720]   So we're starting to think about skills we need.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.360]   We don't have.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:14.280]   There was an acknowledgement and recognition that we don't know how to get this talent.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.760]   Then Satcha and Phil Spector, Spencer had a gaming and Microsoft
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.360]   started having conversations with them.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.960]   When Phil called, it happened to be a time we were getting ready to start a long range planning
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.840]   process realizing there were going to be challenges and issues.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.640]   This is the kind of thing, by the way, that you would say it was a strategic move.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.920]   It was the move we had to make at this time in the business,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:44.600]   completely ignoring all the other issues that he's facing personally.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.440]   They just like Facebook rebranding to meta.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.320]   Look over here.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.560]   Please don't look at all this other stuff.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.440]   We're moving on.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:56.840]   Plus there's stock price thanks to all these harassment allegations had tumbled to almost half
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.200]   over the last year.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.040]   And Microsoft was offering him 45% premium over the price.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.800]   Microsoft in cash in cash.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.760]   In cash.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.240]   Of course, you're going to take that.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.240]   Why?
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.680]   You know, there's not even a question.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.280]   He says they asked him, good on games beat.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.120]   Was a sexual harassment investigation a factor?
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   He said it seemed to affect the stock price, right?
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.880]   He said, I think it would affect the stock price.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:29.240]   Is pushing out overwatch in Diablo?
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.080]   And then people started to see this year's Call of Duty.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.960]   He wasn't performing well.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.760]   I think the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:43.400]   filing and the Wall Street Journal article contributed, but stocks go up and down for a variety of reasons.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.040]   In our view is $95 a share with all cash.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.200]   That's a great deal for our shareholders.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.280]   And it was an easy judgment.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.320]   It's a great deal.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.480]   Shout out to Dean Takahashi who did that interview too.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   Dean did work with Dean when I was at Metro Beat.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.840]   So yeah, great, good stuff.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.360]   Yeah, very good, very good job.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.320]   So, Conic's not going to say.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.720]   I felt the heat.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.240]   I thought I'd get out of the kitchen.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.080]   He's going to get out with a lot of money.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.320]   Just proving, you know.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:17.720]   Has there been any reporting on who else came at Activision?
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.280]   If anybody else started to make a run at him?
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.800]   I haven't seen any, but it's also like who can?
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   You know, who has enough money to do this?
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.120]   Maybe Apple, but Apple historically has been really bad with games.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   They've had good stuff since the App Store came about and Apple Arcade is starting.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.440]   And they're really good with indie developers, but they don't really make their own games.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.520]   You know, they don't really understand this market.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.760]   So maybe Google, you know, it would have to be a big boy to get out of.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.600]   I think if Google comes to you and your buddy Amazon, Amazon, I would listen to Amazon.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.120]   Google, I would laugh them out the door.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.120]   I mean, look what they've done with Stadia.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.360]   They did, in fact, create their own independent game studio,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.720]   which didn't even last a year.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.440]   Google.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.400]   So did Amazon.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:14:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.560]   And they kind of shut some stuff down.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.160]   Although New Worlds do that.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.000]   I've heard doing very well for Amazon.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.600]   So it just, Microsoft makes sense across the board.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.800]   They're already in gaming.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.040]   They make a very popular console, not the number one, but the number two console.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.560]   They have the other thing that's not to be ignored,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.680]   as Conik was saying, they have AI expertise.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.800]   They have cloud expertise.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.520]   They have Azure.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.560]   In fact, it's good for Microsoft's other businesses.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.680]   The more they use Azure, the more they use gaming,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.000]   especially XCloud, their cloud gaming.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.560]   That's a good testament to the strength of their network,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.960]   which they can show other companies.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   Look, we're living on Azure.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.240]   You should live on Azure.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.840]   Now, I think this all-in-all is a great deal for Microsoft.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.400]   It's expensive.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.280]   It's also--
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:48.840]   That's the only negative.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.520]   It's the thing Dwight had mentioned too, like the Netflix of gaming.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.640]   That is what game pass is.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.160]   And we haven't talked about game pass yet.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.600]   But that subscription service is ridiculous.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.080]   It's a ridiculously good deal for consumers.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.120]   You pay a monthly fee and you get access to hundreds of games
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.880]   and as Microsoft buys all these studios--
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.840]   Now even better.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.760]   They get wrapped into game pass.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.800]   So then it's a no-brainer if you're a Windows user or an Xbox user.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.720]   Like, why wouldn't you pay for this?
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.920]   And why wouldn't you pay for what was the game pass ultimate,
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.760]   which also has Xbox Live?
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.040]   You get everything.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.600]   So I'd rather pay $15 a month rather than $60 for a new game.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.520]   But $15 a month, you get those new games like the new Microsoft stuff
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.560]   immediately.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.200]   So it's just such a good deal.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.760]   And that is completely changing the gaming landscape right now.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.720]   So Sony is hustling to figure out a solution
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.360]   because the way Sony makes games is so different than the way Xbox
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.360]   studios make games.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.480]   Sony makes big AAA titles like The Last of Us 2.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.800]   Microsoft has had a lot of trouble making their own games.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.280]   It took Halo Infinite so many years and so many delays to come out.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.120]   So the value proposition of what Microsoft is building here
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.560]   just seems undeniably great for consumers.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.160]   But there's a lot of worry.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.680]   I'm sure Brianna would have talked about what
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.680]   this means for developers.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.600]   Over in Gadget, Jessica Condit wrote up a great piece about why
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   this is not a good thing for the gaming industry
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.680]   because for developers, more consolidation is not always good.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.600]   And a lot of people think indie gaming is where the future--
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.520]   Can you even live an indie game?
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.960]   No, not anymore.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.480]   Can't do it?
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.200]   Not with this.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.040]   Not with this.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.200]   No, I don't think with this deal.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.680]   No, because you've got--
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.120]   I mean, who knows what Tencent is doing, but you've got Sony,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.360]   which is a giant studio.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.240]   You've got Microsoft.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.400]   There's a lot of gravity.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.800]   It's like black holes.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.960]   Regarding the Netflix of games, there's
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.160]   more than one of these operations like XPass.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.400]   There's Nvidia has one, Steam.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.720]   And it's--
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   It's a business subscription, right?
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.640]   Nvidia isn't the same.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.320]   It's a little different.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   That's just streaming.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.040]   That's not like all you can eat.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.200]   Just gobble up all these games immediately.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.080]   But it wouldn't take that much for Steam to start offering that.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.280]   And they probably will at some point.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.120]   There is a--
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.640]   There's a little bit of a cloud business in Steam.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.360]   But it's not the big business.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.840]   Mostly it's you buy games in Steam.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.520]   It's a library.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.960]   You buy games and also your internal cloud.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.480]   So you have a Steam box.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.600]   You have your gaming PC.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.160]   And you put an app on your Apple TV or something.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.280]   You can play games remotely within your house.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.280]   You could stream locally.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.240]   But doing it remotely or from far off distances.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.640]   That's much harder.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.120]   What Nvidia is doing is interesting.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.080]   But that is specifically against Xbox cloud gaming, which
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.480]   I feel like Microsoft is just hedging their bets on right
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:36.980]   now.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.520]   But the brilliant thing is that is a part of Game Pass as well.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.800]   So Game Pass subscribers on their consoles now on PCs
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.920]   can just hit a button and start streaming game.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.000]   Don't have to download anything.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.400]   Don't have to install it.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.560]   Microsoft just really has their fingers
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.760]   in all the pieces of the future of gaming.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.640]   And I think that's what's worrying a lot of big companies.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.040]   I'm sure Sony is freaking out right now.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.720]   Because when it comes to online stuff,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.600]   when it comes to next gen gaming ideas,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.080]   Sony almost always feels like they're
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.520]   kind of lagging behind.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.520]   Whereas Nintendo and Microsoft tend to be the invaders, really.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.640]   I wonder if Game Pass is clearly a winner.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.360]   I'm sure the price will go up.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.960]   I wonder if it'd be even more of a winner
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.120]   if they could have sold more Xboxes.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.080]   The supply is so constrained.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.160]   Although, I mean, the benefit of Game Pass
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.520]   is you can play on a double-track Xbox.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.080]   You could play it on an old one.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.520]   You could play it anywhere.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   They've also talked about making dongles
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.960]   that you just plug into your TV.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.520]   And that's what you used to stream cloud games to.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.400]   Because all the work's done in the cloud.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.520]   So it can run an A-dum terminal, basically.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.520]   Where Microsoft's going, there are no consoles.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.600]   It is the back to the future thing.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.120]   They're leapfrogging to this whole other idea
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.440]   of what the industry is going to be.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.640]   Whereas Sony's like, please buy this box.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.680]   This box is all of us.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.800]   This is our entire company.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.120]   People are buying this box.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.440]   Yeah, people are buying it.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.280]   They are.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.960]   It's the best selling by far and away.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.920]   It's not as constrained either.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.880]   I don't know what Sony did differently from Microsoft.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.120]   But it's a lot easier to get a PlayStation 5
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.880]   than an Xbox Series X.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.080]   S you can get, but X is hard to get.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.560]   I know, because I keep trying.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.920]   Microsoft doesn't care,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.600]   because they just want you to buy that subscription.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.440]   I think you're right.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.280]   Stay on it forever.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.120]   I think you're right.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   The way they want you to buy an Xbox these days
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.760]   is with a $35 a month Game Pass subscription
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.400]   that includes an Xbox.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.200]   They're so smart.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.240]   I honestly am more and more impressed
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.800]   with Satya Nadella's management.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.400]   He's turned away from that Windows.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.240]   It's Windows or nothing, right?
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.600]   He's turned away from that.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.720]   He's really pivoted a giant company
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   and has made it more successful.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.800]   And I think this is a really good example
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.600]   of a strategic acquisition
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.440]   that just makes sense in every way.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.480]   And they've got the money.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.280]   It's about half of their cash position.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.400]   It's about one month of revenue.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.680]   I mean, that's expensive.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.200]   It's not cheap.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.520]   But I think it's a good investment in their future.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.200]   And the main thing to me is it synergizes well
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.680]   with their other businesses.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.800]   It's just a natural all around.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.560]   I can't see any negatives at all to it.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.400]   - Absolutely.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.440]   This has shifted the entire industry,
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.440]   but also really charts the course from Microsoft's future.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.680]   When it comes to mobile gaming,
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   and I cringe when people talk about the metaverse now,
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.760]   but whatever that is,
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.200]   certainly this puts them in a place to be a major player
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.600]   in whatever virtual future we're kind of moving towards.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.120]   - Well, and that's the other question is,
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.360]   I mean, e-sports, right?
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.080]   You'd like to be in that business these days.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.880]   That's got a growth cloud gaming,
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.320]   but cloud everything, cloud windows, cloud office.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.000]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.880]   And the other thing Microsoft clearly wants to do.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.080]   It's one of the reasons they bought LinkedIn.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.920]   It's why they tried to get Discord.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   They want somehow to be part of communities,
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.800]   part of social, I guess, is the way you describe it.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.840]   They want the social graph.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.720]   They want access to the social graph.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.040]   And that's you get with this as well, right?
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.040]   - But they're not good at it.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.960]   Microsoft is kind of like Apple,
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.800]   but they're not good at it.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.880]   - Yeah.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.400]   - And I mean, I forget where I saw this,
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.240]   but I saw something written last week about.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   LinkedIn is the most cringe social network that there is.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.480]   It's marketers and walks and business geeks
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.960]   and more jargon than you can shake a stick at.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.840]   And it's just, it's really uncomfortable.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.800]   And Microsoft is just not good at that.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.240]   Historically, they've tried and they had just not been able
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.200]   to make that work for them.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.360]   - But Phil Spence will be running the gaming
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.880]   business is good, right?
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.400]   He's a good manager.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.360]   He's not a nerdy business wonk.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.960]   I'm sure he talks to talk about Microsoft, but-
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.960]   - But on Xbox, the communities are per game.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.680]   And that's a different thing that like having
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.000]   the Xbox community, the communities are per game.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.960]   - Well, that's a really good point because
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.600]   we discovered that 10 years ago,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.760]   almost exactly when we created a gaming show called Game On,
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.360]   that there is no monolithic gaming community.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.360]   There is so diverse.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.440]   There's console gamers who hate PC gamers,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.800]   who hate casual gamers.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.160]   And if you're a Call of Duty player,
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.560]   you're not interested in Battlefield.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.960]   You're not, it's really interesting.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.320]   They are very stratified.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.480]   And so we couldn't come up with one show
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.000]   that would appeal to everybody,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.520]   but that doesn't mean Microsoft couldn't have
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.240]   stratified communities in all those areas.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.120]   - Mm-hmm. And the landscape just looks really different now.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.280]   They ended 10 years ago too.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.840]   Like, yeah, people tend to like their franchises,
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.480]   but I listen to a ton of video game podcasts.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.320]   - Do you?
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.400]   - The thing, yeah, I don't have enough time to like
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.240]   play all the games I wanna play or read all the reviews
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.080]   and stuff.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.920]   So podcasts are like a nice passive way
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.520]   for me to keep up with what's happening.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.760]   And there's a lot of like great general coverage there,
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.080]   but I know the way people want to kind of consume stuff now
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.640]   is by watching videos, watching people play
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.720]   either via live stream.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.640]   - Well, that's what's really exploded.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.480]   - Twig.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.920]   - That's what's really exploded the last 10 years
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.240]   is let's play videos.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.600]   First on YouTube with Minecraft and now with Twitch.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.080]   And Microsoft tried to get in that business.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.640]   They bought Mixer, remember, and had to fold it.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.680]   There was a terrible flop. - There was so much money
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.520]   at it.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.240]   - They hired, they stole away Ninja and other,
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.600]   you know, famous gamers and just flopped miserably.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.880]   So maybe, I mean, maybe they do have something
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.640]   to learn in this, but here's another chance.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.840]   Here's another shot for them.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.760]   - Certainly, certainly.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.160]   - Yeah.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.080]   I certainly don't blame Bobby Kotik.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.000]   I hope he gets out though.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.880]   I really do.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.480]   And then goes to jail.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.320]   That would be my--
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.720]   - Yeah, I hope he gets the look at his hundreds of millions.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.280]   And then like, yeah, this is some serious consequences.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.120]   - Yeah, through bars.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.960]   That'll be good.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.800]   I shouldn't say.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.960]   - He'll spend it on lawyers.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.880]   - That's mean, that's mean, yeah.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.280]   - Well deserved.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.120]   - But yeah, I feel like it might be kind of,
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.160]   they had, I mean, we've covered these stories
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.880]   over the years, but they had a Bill Cosby room
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.960]   where they had a picture of Bill Cosby
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.840]   and they would invite women back to the room.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.360]   I mean, and Kotik knew about all this.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.800]   There's no question.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.120]   He either turned a blind eye toward it or even encouraged it.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.960]   And so I think the buck stops there, I really do.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.520]   And boy, it's just a nasty, nest of stuff.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.000]   We talked about this also,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.440]   and this is where Briana would be a great advantage
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.720]   to this show.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.600]   I think they had the perception,
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.840]   there is the perception,
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.440]   you need to create that kind of environment
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.120]   to get the best game developers.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.720]   That's what gamers are, that's what game developers are.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.600]   And I hate that notion.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.080]   I think we've gotta get beyond that.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.920]   That's terrible.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.760]   - It sucks.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.200]   I think like at a certain point over the last few decades,
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.600]   this also like was the rock star thing, you know,
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.200]   a grand theft auto-fobed.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.960]   People thought the game developers,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.640]   they wanted to be rock stars.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.360]   You know, so they get to be as wild and crazy as like,
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.600]   Led Zeppelin was in their heyday or something.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.840]   And like it is that mentality of like,
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.920]   it is basically bro-culture.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.160]   You know, somehow he gets to--
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.000]   - Programmers.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.440]   - Yeah, programmers makes genius and that makes us money.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.800]   So that's what we want.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.120]   And yeah, the world is certainly very different now.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.400]   So I hope, I hope like he faces a record.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.760]   - If you go back to the earliest days of gaming,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   that's how Activision started.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.000]   Atari wouldn't let their programmers take credit
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.280]   for the games.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.160]   Remember in Atari games in the early days,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.480]   programmers would hide Easter eggs
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.200]   so that they could have their name, you know, be seen.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.600]   Activision said, "We'll give you credit.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.520]   We'll let your name be on the game."
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.800]   And they were able to draw a huge talent away from Atari
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.040]   to Activision, developed amazing games like Pitfall,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:12.880]   Prince of Persia.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.200]   It was a really great game house.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.160]   And it was because they said, "You can take credit."
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.920]   So it may be that's in the roots of Activision.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.600]   - And by the way, also, yeah.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.440]   Go ahead.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.440]   - You also have to give credit for that to id Software,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.560]   which created really kind of the first group
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.040]   of rock stars. - Star stars.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.880]   - Programmers. - Yeah.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.200]   - Right, right.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.960]   And it became like a super group.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.800]   You know, I had seen the original developers of Doom
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.080]   and Quake referred to as like the Beatles of gaming.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.600]   And it was funny when they went off on their separate ways,
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.120]   they really couldn't kind of do what they did, you know, at id.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.280]   But what's interesting is Bethesda owns id
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.160]   and id is now under the auspices of Microsoft.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.080]   - Microsoft owns everything.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.040]   Microsoft owns Pitfall and, you know,
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.080]   all of gaming history now, basically.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.720]   But it's funny you brought up Atari, Leo,
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.200]   because there are so many stories about Nolan Bushnell
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.880]   and how he ran Atari and like what a sexist prick he was,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.720]   basically. - Oh, really?
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.120]   - And that's the gaming.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.640]   That's gaming, you know?
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   And gaming needs to be accessible and open
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.720]   and welcoming to women because that's 50% of the market.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.600]   It's not just guys playing games.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.640]   It doesn't have to be like that.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.000]   I think that the times have changed, I hope, I hope.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.160]   By the way, did you know that Bobby Kotok
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.980]   and Cheryl Sandberg dated for three years?
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.440]   - What? - It's very easy.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.320]   (laughing)
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.160]   - Very good. - What?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   - I don't know, I mean, this is the People magazine segment here.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.080]   I didn't, chat room just told me.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.400]   A year after Cheryl's husband passed,
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.580]   she started dating Bobby Kotok.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.600]   So I don't know what that means.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.480]   They broke up three years later.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.640]   But, okay.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.000]   - It is funny to see page six follow something like that.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.160]   - That was a very page six story.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.000]   See, tech is with it now.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:10.840]   It's hip, it's new.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.600]   It's now, it's not the geeks anymore.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.320]   That's not my saying, she really leaned in there.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.560]   Let's take a look. (laughing)
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.480]   I didn't mean that, I'm sorry.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.000]   Neither here nor there.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.840]   Very interesting.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.800]   A, we got to first, they got to get regulatory approval.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.480]   That's not a cake walk.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.440]   And then B, they've got to absorb this behemoth.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.960]   They did pretty well, I think with Bethesda.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.120]   They certainly did, we know they did well
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.840]   with Mojang and Minecraft.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.560]   So I think there's a good track record there.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.000]   And then let's see what happens with the exclusives.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.080]   I think Microsoft's best bet is just to say,
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.640]   game pass everywhere.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.480]   Play it on your PlayStation.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.320]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.160]   - It's game pass everywhere.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.400]   We don't care. - Bring it to the Mac.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.560]   - Yeah. - Bring it to the Mac.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.840]   - Well, it's funny because there is a story
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.880]   about Fortnite coming back to the Mac and iOS
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.960]   through the back door.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.800]   - Streaming, right.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.200]   - With GeForce now with Nvidia's service.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.120]   - Yeah.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.880]   - So that could happen.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.160]   You can, right now you can play,
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.400]   I think you could play game pass in a browser on the Mac game.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.160]   - You can play it in a browser too.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.200]   But I do wonder, looking at all this news,
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.520]   what is Apple doing?
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.200]   You know, I just, I've reviewed all the M1 MacBooks
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.280]   and whatnot.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.560]   And every time I try to get games outside of Apple
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.640]   or Kate on that, it is a nightmare.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.760]   And it's ridiculous like how badly Apple has treated games
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.240]   as like a segment.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   So I don't know if anything ever has been there.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.840]   - It was almost a self-fulfilling prophecy
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.400]   that people said, oh, there's no gaming on Mac.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.360]   - And then Apple said, yeah, you're right.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.200]   - You're right.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.040]   - Right.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.680]   - But every now and then,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.840]   every now and then Apple pops its head up and says,
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.000]   no wait, gaming on the Mac is great.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.400]   And it's coming back and they trot out some developers
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.720]   and they haven't done that.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.200]   Remember the Pippin?
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.440]   They were actually building a console at one point.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.280]   - Yes.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.640]   So, but the thing is, is that these M1 Macs,
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.720]   particularly the M1 Pro and the M1 Macs,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.040]   are incredibly powerful.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.320]   They have the same kind of a graphics subsystem
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.640]   that is on the iPhone and the iPad,
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.760]   which is great for mobile gaming.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.160]   And so the components are there for them to do it
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.440]   in a big way.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.240]   I think somebody just needs to kind of step up and go,
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.560]   here's, well, it needs a killer app.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.400]   It needs a killer game.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.640]   - But aren't they swimming against the tides though?
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.360]   Because it seems, I've actually thought this,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.240]   when Apple's creating these better and better desktops
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.400]   and there's no question,
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.920]   these things are superb.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   I'm in love with my M1 Pro MacBook 14 inch MacBook.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.880]   It's amazing.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.080]   But isn't the trend away from powerful desktops
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.240]   towards cloud computing?
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.720]   And that's where gaming's going, right?
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.440]   You don't need a fancy gaming rig.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.760]   You don't need an M1.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.240]   We'll run the servers in the cloud.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.760]   You just need a stream to it.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.280]   And so I wonder if maybe we've been saying this for years,
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.640]   I don't know if the desktop computing is dead,
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.520]   but I do feel like the cloud is going to,
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.960]   at some point, take over.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   - Well, particularly if you're on,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   like I'm on a M1 Pro MacBook 14 inch MacBook Pro now.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.520]   - But you don't need to be.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.360]   - I don't need to be, but if I was not connected to the internet,
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.600]   if I was on a plane and wanted to play a game on this,
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.200]   if you're not connected,
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.840]   if you're, I mean, it's a mobile device, right?
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.640]   If you're not connected, you want to be able to do that.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.560]   And it has the power to do it.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.200]   - Well, maybe that's a 5G thing.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.080]   - I don't know.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.560]   If you're underground or on the subway or in the air.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.920]   - In a submarine.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.240]   - Right.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.920]   - In the subway, like before,
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.240]   when I moved to New York, like there was no
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.800]   cell phone service in subways.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.080]   You know, that didn't happen until a couple of weeks after,
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.080]   or a couple of years after.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.240]   So that was like 2012 or something.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.520]   So we want cloud gaming to be the kind of end all and be all,
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.480]   but right now people just want an easy way
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   to like get their little gaming fix.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.800]   So I guess Apple is leaning on mobile, right?
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.240]   And they're extending mobile to desktop to everything,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.520]   to even Apple TV.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.080]   But I just, I'm a little disappointed,
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.680]   like proper desktop gaming is not really
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.840]   what they're doing at all.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.680]   - Yeah.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.120]   I mean, so it's complicated.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.560]   I mean, the Apple Epic thing cut them off
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.520]   from the number one game engine.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.000]   They can't use the Unreal Engine
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.400]   'cause that's an epic thing and they don't like Epic.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.960]   So you've got to use Unity,
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.200]   which is kind of a weak second.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.880]   Unity might get better.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.920]   I don't know, I feel like Apple,
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.200]   it's almost as if Apple doesn't even care.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.080]   I don't know.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.920]   And should they care?
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.360]   Why should they care?
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.080]   - Beyond mobile games, yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.120]   - Mobile, they own mobile really,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:55.960]   if you think about it,
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   they own mobile 'cause they own the platform.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.800]   - Oh, but it's just such a waste.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.040]   I mean, it's just such a waste of power.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.880]   - All that power.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.720]   - To do it.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.000]   All that power.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.880]   And the other thing is,
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.440]   is what you could see is you could see it
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.880]   coming in the back door
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   because these M1 Macs can run iOS titles.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.280]   And if you had a developer who created a killer game on iOS
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.760]   that then when you were ran it on a Mac,
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.600]   it ran like a game on a Mac.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.880]   That would be really interesting.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.720]   - Yeah.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.600]   I think some of the Apple arcade titles have done that.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.760]   I know Fantasian,
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.400]   which is the game from the Final Fantasy director or creator.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.200]   Right, that is a beautiful RPG and it works well at mobile,
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.880]   but when you bring it to like a big to a desktop,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.560]   it like runs in 4K, I believe, or has 4K assets.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.040]   So they do scale quite a bit.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.880]   - Let's take a little break.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.720]   Lots more to talk about when we come back
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.920]   to vendor Hardewars here.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.280]   He's a senior editor at Engadget
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.480]   and the host of the film cast.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.360]   - What, what, what, this is,
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.920]   it feels like content is starting to ramp up.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.520]   Seems really good, yeah.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.280]   - We're also in the middle of Sundance right now.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.040]   So I, for the past couple of days,
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.040]   I've been watching several movies every night
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.440]   because I'm just like consuming as much Sundance stuff
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.560]   as I can, but hey.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.720]   - What are you excited about?
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.080]   - There's a couple of things.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.880]   There's this movie I just saw called After Yang
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.960]   by the director Koganada, which is fantastic.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.000]   It's about a family that loses their helper
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.040]   kind of Android and it basically dies
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.120]   at the beginning of the movie and the entire reason.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.520]   - Oh no, whatever we do.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.400]   - It's amazing, it's amazing and beautiful and cool.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.560]   - I wanna see that, do they grieve it?
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.680]   - They, like it is a grieving movie
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.840]   about the influences thing has had in the family.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.520]   It stars Colin Farrell too.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.920]   And I love like sad, broody Colin Farrell
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.120]   in like good serious stuff.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.920]   So it's also like, it's sci-fi.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.920]   So like there's this great like vision of the future.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.760]   - I wanna see.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.720]   - Of like self-driving cars with plants and bamboo.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.560]   - What's it called with that?
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.000]   That's gonna be After Yang.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.280]   - After Yang is the robot, I guess, yeah.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.120]   - Yeah.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.800]   - Oh, I really wanna see that.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.560]   Did you see the power of the dog?
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.560]   Do you think that was good?
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.920]   - I did, I loved it.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.600]   - I loved it in the campions.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.440]   She's weird.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.880]   - I like her, she's weird.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.800]   It's weird.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.680]   It starts off as a Western, turns out it's not,
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.600]   it's a thriller.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.960]   - Hey, it was a Western thriller, sure.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.880]   - Western thriller.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.600]   - It's an awkward Western.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.080]   - It's awkward as hell.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.920]   - Yes.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.760]   - And I'm not sure.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.600]   - I had a hard time watching it.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.440]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.200]   I'm not sure Benedict Cumberbatch really
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.560]   is a convincing cowboy, to be honest.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.280]   But I'm sure it's gonna win an Oscar.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.600]   I'm sure it's gonna win an Oscar.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.360]   That's, anyway, I told Lisa,
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.800]   'cause we're both looking, scratching our heads saying,
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.640]   "Did we like that?
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.160]   "I don't think we like that.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.000]   "Did we?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.960]   "I don't know."
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.120]   And then I said, "But it will be an Oscar contender.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:46.960]   "I'm sure of it."
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.000]   - Yes.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.560]   - The other one, and I know this was your most recent episode,
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.840]   the Apple Plus's Macbeth.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.200]   - Beautiful.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.040]   - No. - Oh my God.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.480]   - Beautiful, yes. - No?
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.600]   Beautiful, yes. - The witches?
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.000]   - No, the witches, no.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.160]   The biggest problem I had with it,
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.200]   I love the black and white.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.040]   I love how it's shot, it's gorgeous.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.960]   Everything's in tight close-ups.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.360]   Shakespeare was not made for tight close-ups.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.600]   I'm sorry, it's theater.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.280]   You don't, it's not, everything's tight close-ups.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.880]   I didn't like that.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.680]   And I felt like it hurt the actor's performances, frankly.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.400]   - I think the transition from,
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:32.480]   with Denzel Washington from kind of a reasonable,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   but brooding contender for the throne to a madman
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.640]   was like just to, like someone threw a switch to,
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   usually it would happen.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.880]   - It moves a little too briskly.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.480]   - Yeah, there were actors, it's some of the best actors.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.000]   And I didn't feel like the acting was very good.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.960]   So I don't know. - Well, it also was,
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.560]   if you step back and look at it
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.120]   and kind of don't think Shakespeare,
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.440]   it really looks like a Cohen Brothers.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.280]   - Oh yeah, you could tell it's a--
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.120]   - I mean the characters, the flat, the photography,
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.160]   the flat affect. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.000]   - The ultra-violence at times, yeah.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.440]   - See, I like Macbeth.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.440]   But I guess maybe that's probably the part of the problem
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.680]   is I have all these preconceived notions of Macbeth.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.040]   Don't look up, not a great movie, fascinating cultural piece.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.600]   - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, sure.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.640]   - Definitely. - Yeah.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.120]   - It's kind of middling on it, yeah.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.000]   - My money for the Oscars is on pig.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.520]   - I loved pig.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.520]   - Pig was a great movie. - I loved pig.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.880]   We talked about that last time you were on, I think.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.960]   I loved pig. - Oh, it was great.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.960]   It was a great movie. - Nick was caged
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   as the deranged master chef who's left society until--
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.560]   - He's not deranged, he's the sanest one of all.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.240]   - Until they kill his-- - He is the sanest one.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.800]   - Until they kill his truffle hunting pig.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.280]   - And he comes into town saying, "I want my pig."
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   (laughing)
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.120]   - They kidnap the pig, Leo, they kidnap them.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.920]   - They don't tend to kill it. - They don't intend to kill it.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   - What happens? - They don't intend to.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.320]   - That's a spoiler. - No, I think it's in--
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.320]   - Is it a spoiler? - Nick Cage will be dominated
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.000]   for best actor.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.720]   I really hope he would win it because I just thought
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.760]   that was a phenomenal performance.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.960]   And so withheld, you know,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.040]   he was caged-- - So good in that.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.320]   - He wasn't showing the scenery. - Nick Cage, right?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.960]   He did do Nick Cage, right? - Yeah.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.200]   Yeah, he wasn't showing the scenery.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.920]   Matrix resurrections. - Loved it.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.640]   - Loved it, yep. - Interesting.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.760]   - Was my number one movie of last year
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.840]   just because of the sheer joy it gave me.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.360]   I love a movie that is not made for anybody else, you know?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.080]   Like it's very specific. - It's a Matrix fan movie,
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.640]   yeah, I agree. - Right, right.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.240]   - Not own Matrix fans, you know, there are degrees of them.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.960]   I loved the first Matrix, didn't like the sequels.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.320]   This felt like it was another sequel.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.320]   It didn't really click for me, but--
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.160]   - Mm.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.520]   - I, you know, there was some good parts.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.880]   It was some good stuff.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.520]   Great action. - Good stuff, yeah.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.440]   - I can't think of a movie that has reckoned with
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.240]   like the history of franchises and what we expect from--
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.840]   - It's always hard. - What Hollywood expects
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.160]   from them, like it is such a smart movie
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.040]   in terms of what it's doing and what it's wrestling with.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   And I just, I love the Wachowski's too,
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.280]   like their sensibility, their show sense eight on Netflix
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.680]   is beautiful and just-- - I have really enjoyed
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.960]   sensate, is that coming back or is that over?
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.320]   It didn't seem like it finished, yeah.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.080]   - It's pretty much done, they had like a movie
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.440]   kind of wrapping things up, but so many sensate people
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.320]   are in Matrix resurrections and just thematically
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.520]   what that show was about.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.400]   - It's very similar to sensate, I agree, yeah.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.240]   - Yeah.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.480]   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make this the movie second.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.320]   - Movies are good.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.560]   - I could do this all night. - Whatever,
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.440]   Divinners on, I love talking about this stuff.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.320]   Obviously, but you don't mind either, so.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.840]   Oh no, I love it. - I'll, I'll, I will throw a shout out
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.680]   there, the Jesse Eisenberg movie
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.160]   that just premiered at Sundance,
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.480]   when you finish saving the world
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.520]   is one of the most insufferable things I've ever seen.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   - Oh, that's true. - So I will just put
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.040]   a red flag against that, how about that?
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.080]   - Not a fan actually, Mr. Eisenberg,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.480]   so I don't think I, I don't think I, I'll miss that.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.960]   - He can't be good, but. - That's quite a word.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.840]   Insufferable. - Yeah.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.680]   - Wow.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.080]   - All right.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.800]   If you like this kind of thing, the film cast.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.640]   - The film cast, the filmcast.com.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.480]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.560]   - Awesome.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.400]   - I love it.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   To me, I could listen all day.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.600]   Let's take a little break, talk about our sponsor.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.680]   We'll come back with a lot more to Vendra.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.320]   Dwight, I'll ask you about your life too later.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.760]   (laughing)
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.320]   It's not all about the Vendra.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.040]   Hey, I do want to talk about our absolute favorite VPN.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.760]   I think you know if I say that, you're going to say,
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.120]   oh yeah, Leo loves Express VPN, of course.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.600]   Honestly, there are so many reasons to run a VPN,
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.240]   but I think the one, it used to be about security, right?
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.680]   And it's still about security.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.840]   And then I think for some people,
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.240]   it's about watching Netflix and Japan or England.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.080]   It's still about that.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.480]   All that stuff still works.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   But increasingly it's become a privacy issue.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   And I think when you're looking at what Big Tech is up to,
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:00.120]   and you really say, how can I keep these companies
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.840]   from knowing everything I'm doing, people want,
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.200]   there's a lot of things people want to do
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.120]   to protect themselves.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.040]   And I think a VPN, it's not the only thing you should do,
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.120]   but it's one of the big things.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.800]   The idea that a single company might control 90%
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.680]   of the internet searches to your email,
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.880]   runs your phone, has a device in your house
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.600]   with a microphone.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.160]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.320]   And in at least the case of Google,
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.760]   they make money by exploiting your personal data.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.880]   They're very clear about that.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.480]   That's how Google makes money selling ads
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.520]   based on what they know about you.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.560]   Maybe you, like many of our listeners,
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.040]   want to put a little layer of protection
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.120]   between your online activity
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.920]   and these big tech companies who do literally
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.320]   want to know everything you do.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.360]   That's why you might want to check out a good VPN.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.160]   You might want to check out ExpressVPN.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.800]   Now, something I've always talked about with VPNs is,
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.080]   you're just passing the buck.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.240]   You've got to trust the VPN you use.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.560]   It's very important.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.000]   Well, I can tell you, you can trust them.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.760]   Independent audits have proven it.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.560]   They care so much they've created something
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.000]   they call the trusted server technology.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.880]   You're running in memory in a sandbox process
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.360]   that literally cannot write to the hard drive.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.760]   And as soon as you log out, it disappears poof.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.120]   And so does every trace of your visit.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.680]   And again, that has been proven so by independent auditors.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.840]   So you can trust that.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.200]   Think about how much of your life
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.680]   you're putting on the internet.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.280]   Every site you visit, every video you watch,
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.800]   every message you send is tracked as data mined.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.520]   But when you're running ExpressVPN,
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.640]   your IP address is not yours.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.240]   The IP address you use to emerge
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.000]   into the public internet is theirs.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.760]   So it makes it so much harder to trace and sell to advertisers.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.720]   You might use incognito and mode in your browser,
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.640]   but that just means somebody on your machine
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.520]   can't see what you're up to.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.280]   You better believe the browser company knows what you're up to.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.160]   Your carrier knows what you're up to,
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.920]   unless you use an ExpressVPN.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.160]   It also has the benefit of encrypting 100%
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.080]   of your internet data.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.240]   So you're safe from eavesdroppers on the network.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.600]   And the best part about ExpressVPN is they invest.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.880]   They invest in their business.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.360]   When you get a free VPN, you've really got to wonder
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.760]   who is the product?
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.240]   Who are you the customer?
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.040]   Or are they selling your information?
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.680]   With ExpressVPN, it's not expensive,
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.440]   a little less than seven bucks a month.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.760]   But that's important.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.480]   That transaction means you're the customer.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.920]   You're not the product.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.960]   That's why they protect your privacy.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.680]   That's why they make sure you've got enough speed
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.960]   to watch high-def video.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.880]   They don't slow down your connection.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.600]   It's one of the reasons it's the number one VPN service.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.640]   Mashable says, so tech radar says so.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.680]   And it's so easy to use.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.520]   You download the app, you put it on your phone,
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.160]   your computer, you tap a button, you're protected.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.760]   You can even put it on your router.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.800]   Protect your whole household.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.520]   And I can tell you this, no one will complain,
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.360]   oh, what happened there is internet so slow
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.200]   because ExpressVPN again, invest in the network.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.000]   I've turned it on on my router and no one even knows.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.400]   I took ExpressVPN to Mexico.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.160]   I was using it for security as much as privacy.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.760]   Stop handing over your personal data
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.440]   to the big tech monopoly that mines your activity
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.120]   and sells your information.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.080]   Protect yourself with a VPN I trust to keep me safe online.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.680]   Visit expressvpn.com/twit.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   That's eXPR, e-s-s-vpn.com/twit.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.200]   And you can get an extra three months free.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.240]   Go to expressvpn.com/twit.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.280]   Now to learn more.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.000]   Thank you, expressvpn, for supporting this week in tech.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.920]   And of course, thank you, Twit listeners,
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.920]   for supporting us by using that address.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.920]   So you know, you saw it here, expressvpn.com/twit.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:44.640]   Fascinating.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.480]   Have you been following the FAA FCC Airline battle
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.560]   that's been going on over 5G?
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.800]   Now this week it came to a head, of course,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.360]   the Verizon and AT&T, who between the two of them
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   spent billions of dollars for this frequency
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.760]   in an FCC auction,
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.520]   are about to turn on those 5G towers, the C-band towers.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:18.920]   FAA, airline manufacturers, airlines and airplane manufacturers
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.160]   say, "Wait a minute, you're gonna break our altimeters.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.320]   "Wait a minute, planes are gonna come out of the sky."
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:33.000]   They put a hold on it, AT&T, Verizon, FFA said,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.200]   "Can you put a hold on it?"
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.240]   They said, "Well, we'll give you a week or two."
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.600]   Anyway, it's starting to roll out.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.480]   Wednesday was the day.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.080]   So far no planes have fallen out of the sky,
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.980]   but maybe some planes aren't flying.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:51.680]   It's very tempting to blame the manufacturers,
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.160]   to blame the FAA or blame the FCC.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.720]   I'll read you something that shows you,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:00.240]   there's enough blame to go around on this one.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.800]   This is from a JUCADRP on Reddit.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.120]   It was one of the Reddit best-ups,
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.520]   and I thought it was the best thing I've read explaining this.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.800]   Airplanes are equipped with radar altimeters.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   They use radar on the frequency between 4,200 and 4,400 megahertz.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.960]   These 5G towers, the CBN towers are 3,730, 980 megahertz.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.400]   There's no overlap.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.760]   But, and this is the problem,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.280]   there's a filter in order to protect the frequencies
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.720]   that the radar is using,
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.480]   so it doesn't get interfered with by other,
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.360]   there's a filter, but the filter is set
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.280]   because thanks to a decades old design,
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.000]   no one else was using this frequency
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   to overlap with this 5G frequency.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.160]   It doesn't need to, but it does.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.280]   So 5G radio could confuse these altimeters.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.600]   That could be, of course, a big hazard for an airplane.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.400]   So in fact, here from 5G Technology World
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.200]   is an exam, is a graph that shows these bands.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.240]   So the altimeter, can you show that John?
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.080]   There you go.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.800]   The altimeter is this yellow thing.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.280]   This is the frequency it needs.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.600]   This is where the 5G band is.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.560]   Unfortunately, this green line
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.480]   that's the filter.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.600]   So because of this old, and it is admittedly
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.640]   an antiquated design, and we should point out
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.440]   that these 5G towers, this spec is 10 years old.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.760]   They knew this was coming,
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.720]   but they never fixed the altimeters.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.560]   - Yeah.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.400]   - They never, they never--
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.240]   - It's infuriating.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.040]   - Yeah.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   So basically, the altimeter opens a channel
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.120]   to listen to radar, but it ends up listening,
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.000]   not just to radar, but to 5G.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.920]   At the time they were designed, there was nothing there.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.980]   There is now.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:59.640]   And in fact, modern filters could easily be put on these
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.560]   things that would eliminate this problem entirely.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.160]   This guy in Reddit writes,
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.440]   the AV in the Asian industry had time to retrofit there
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.880]   at planes, and now they are sorry to be playing dumb.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.000]   They know they can hold the nation's hostage
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.800]   by saying this will disrupt flights
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.680]   in the middle of a pandemic.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.640]   Obviously, safety is paramount,
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.560]   but carriers paid $81 billion for these frequencies
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.080]   because they were not in use.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.120]   So they paid $81 billion for exclusive use
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.200]   of these frequencies.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.560]   The aviation industry is basically arguing
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.640]   they wanna take over more than they need,
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.720]   more than they're even allocated
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.560]   to operate these altimeters.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.320]   And then to defend the aviation industry,
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.600]   one of the reasons air travel is so safe these days
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.040]   is because they are not throwing stuff in and willing nearly.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.920]   And so you can't just go change all those altimeters.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.240]   And then you wanna test it and so forth.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.880]   So you can't change it overnight.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.720]   They've had a little more.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.720]   - We had 10 years to test it.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.880]   - We had 10 years.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.920]   - I've been seeing 5G demos since 2020, 2012.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.600]   So it's ridiculous that this thing,
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.320]   the point where these carriers
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.360]   are also where they can actually get the fast speeds,
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.800]   they've been promising for so long.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.600]   Like this is apparently a big roadblock for them.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.880]   It's just kind of hilarious.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.120]   - This is a sea band.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.080]   This is an ultra wide band.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.120]   - No, this is kind of the mid,
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.480]   this is kind of in between.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.320]   - Mid band.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.400]   - Sub-six and millimeter wave.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.800]   This was, I wrote about this in my column last week
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:37.240]   about what it meant for AT&T and Verizon,
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.040]   which are the two that are using it.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.720]   They've kind of essentially been behind T-Mobile
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.800]   because T-Mobile has a mid band
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.080]   that it got from Sprint, the Spinner Acquisition,
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.800]   and it's been able to offer these speeds
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.560]   that AT&T and Verizon can't for some time.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.840]   - And T-Mobile's C-band
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.280]   does not interfere with altimeters?
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.960]   - No, it is a C-band.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.800]   - It's not an F-band.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.040]   - It's a different frequency, right?
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.560]   It's a different frequency.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.640]   T-Mobile has bought some C-band,
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:09.600]   but they're not gonna set it up till 2023.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.280]   But it is, you know, in Houston,
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:15.000]   a lot of this stuff comes here first.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:15.840]   - Right.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.480]   - A lot of, because it's so flat here,
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.080]   and so it's a good testing ground.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:23.400]   And T-Mobile, Sprint had one of its first standups
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:27.040]   of its service and it was remarkably fast.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.320]   T-Mobile now is very fast.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.080]   And when they switched it on here on Wednesday,
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   I began hearing from readers on Twitter and Facebook,
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.480]   saying that they were starting to seize
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.960]   some speeds on their compatible AT&T and Verizon phones
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.520]   that now could kind of match in the center area
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.840]   the stuff that T-Mobile is.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.680]   - How fast? - So--
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.520]   - So-- - So--
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.360]   - When you say fast, I mean,
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   "Elcher wideband, we're talking a gigabit."
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.360]   But that's not more.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.200]   - Or more. - Or more.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.280]   - But this is not that fast.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.480]   How fast is this? - Yeah, so this,
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.800]   they're saying for C-band,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.440]   it's up to about a gigabit at best.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.800]   When I was talking to Verizon for this story,
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.680]   they said that kind of what they wanna hit
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.600]   is about 300 megabits.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.520]   - That's-- - That's plenty.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.360]   - That is plenty.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.840]   And on my iPhone 13-- - I doubt my phone could go faster
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.280]   than that, to be honest. - Right.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.720]   Well, on my iPhone 13 Pro Max, I have T-Mobile
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:30.040]   and I have seen download speeds up to 700 megabits
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.320]   on my iPhone.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.240]   - Oh, wow.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.640]   So you can go that fast.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.200]   - Yes, and typically, like,
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.200]   what's really interesting on T-Mobile is
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.560]   that if you're down to like two bars,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.120]   I still see like 250 and 300 megabits
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.160]   when I'm picking up one of their--
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.840]   - So what is this? - What is this change?
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.200]   I mean, honestly, you probably don't need
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   that kind of speed.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.720]   - Even at all. - It changes it.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.680]   It changes it for the future,
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.240]   for as we were talking about gaming, mobile gaming,
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.880]   if you're doing streaming gaming,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.080]   it changes it in terms of--
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.720]   - But gaming, it's not so much speed as latency, right?
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.840]   Is this also a lower latency?
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.240]   - Well, in 5G promises lower latency,
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.120]   we haven't seen a lot of that yet.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.240]   You do see it on millimeter wave.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.960]   There's a millimeter wave. - Millimeter wave only goes
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.360]   80 feet from the tower.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.200]   - It goes 80 feet from the tower.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.040]   - No one's like maybe.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.280]   - Yeah. - It can't get through trees.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:27.200]   - Or rain. - But there's a millimeter wave tower
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.880]   about two blocks from my house
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.600]   and I walked over to it-- - Oh.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.960]   - With a Verizon phone and stood under it
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.160]   and got three gigabits down.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.240]   - That's beautiful. - Yeah, but wait a minute.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.040]   - But it's beautiful right there.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.640]   - At this point, yeah, but also at this point,
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.120]   I mean, that's just a number.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.000]   We don't, I mean, yeah, it's great,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.680]   but it's like saying I have a car that go 500 miles an hour.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.520]   - Yeah.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.800]   - And you have to ride around the block
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.600]   under speeding limits and-- - Right, right.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.640]   - I mean, it is more bandwidth
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.800]   than you need now.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.280]   There may be uses coming for it.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.760]   - Like vehicle to vehicle communications, things like that.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.760]   - Right, stuff like that. - Yeah.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.280]   - Right, but, but, you know, in the beginning,
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   when you had your first LTE phones,
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:20.080]   nobody predicted Uber and nobody predicted
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.760]   that Netflix would go where it went.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.600]   So there are things that are out there
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.000]   that eventually could end up, you know,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.960]   making use of that at the moment, no.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:37.280]   - So, okay, I'm sure this airline thing
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.960]   only worked out at some point.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.040]   Probably this is mostly-- - For now,
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:41.960]   for now it's working.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.800]   I mean, there are no airplanes falling out of the sky.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.080]   - Yeah, no, 'cause they aren't turning on towers
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.840]   within two miles of big airplanes.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.600]   - Which is fine because you can still use regular 5G
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.000]   and even millimeter wave in airports.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.320]   A lot of airports have millimeter wave, it's called it.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.640]   - Some, for instance, I think, Etihad,
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.360]   there are a couple of airlines that cannot fly
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.440]   their 777s to the US for this reason.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.120]   And so there's, it is some impingement on traffic,
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.960]   not a lot, but some, I think probably this is more
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.400]   like the airplane manufacturers want the phone industry
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.800]   to pay them to fix the altimeters.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.640]   - Yes, yes.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.520]   - But, but that's a good compromise.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.360]   Just don't put the towers within two miles of an airport.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:27.400]   So, everything's going smoothly.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   (both laughing)
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.080]   The biggest complaint I've heard is from people who have
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.520]   AT&T and Verizon phones and saying,
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.200]   oh, I thought it would be faster.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.640]   - Yeah, it is heartbreaking, like after all this buildup,
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.280]   so we are kind of stuck with speeds that are only
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.120]   slightly faster than LTE, like most of the time.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.600]   And then once in a blue moon, you're in an area
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.400]   and like, you know, Mercury crosses the horizon
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.640]   and you get really fast millimeter wave.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.520]   And then that's it, you'll never see it again.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.200]   - Well, CBAN fixes that.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.880]   CBAN fixes that for AT&T and Verizon.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:08.160]   If you're a T-Mobile customer in an area that they have added it
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.320]   and it's a lot of urban areas, you are seeing that already.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.320]   And it's, the only use I've seen for it is I was,
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:21.760]   I was away from home and I knew I was gonna be in a place
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.520]   where I wasn't gonna have a cellular service
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.520]   or good cellular service and I was getting the 5G UC,
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.080]   which is ultra capacity that it calls for.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.560]   And I was getting like 500 megabits down.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.080]   So I quickly downloaded a couple of episodes
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.720]   of something on Netflix and I got it, you know,
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:44.800]   in just about 30 seconds and then when I got there,
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.040]   I had it down on my phone.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.760]   And that was really handy.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.560]   But that's kind of like, I did it.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.960]   - I mean, one thing people have been talking about
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.760]   is like doing your home internet could just be a cellular,
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.960]   eventually, you know, the way the phone service has gone.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.800]   - Well, yes.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.640]   - And that could be really interesting for some place.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.080]   - Is it Verizon actually rolling that out?
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:12.080]   - Verizon and AT&T mobile both have 5G based home internet
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:17.040]   services, Verizon, the first 5G Verizon home service
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.400]   was launched here in Houston.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.560]   Again, 'cause of the flat area.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.080]   It was based on millimeter wave.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:27.280]   You have to have kind of the router sits in your window,
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.120]   basically.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.040]   - You're two blocks from that tower.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.480]   You can't do it though, right?
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.560]   - No, I can't.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.080]   I can't 'cause there's it.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.760]   Well, no, actually there's one a little closer now,
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:41.400]   but it is, there's a crepe-murdle tree between the you.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.720]   I'm serious, there's a crepe-murdle
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.560]   that you can't-- - Damn it, that's great,
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.320]   damn it. - Chop it down.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:48.680]   - Chop it down.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.120]   - And so, we thought-- - You know what I do?
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:54.440]   We used to have direct TV and there was a tree,
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.320]   in the winter it was fun,
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.840]   but there's a tree that would give very leafy,
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.400]   right in front of the dish.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.880]   So one day I climbed up and I literally carved a you
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.960]   in the tree, I think chopped down the tree,
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.520]   I just put a you where the leaves were
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.680]   so that the dish could see through the tree.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.680]   (laughing)
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.640]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.480]   - Not a bad-- - And it's not
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.320]   a topiary ever, but it got the job done.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.320]   And T-Mobile also has a 5G service.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:24.240]   They've had some problems with the Nokia-based radios
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.240]   that they're using for it.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.400]   It looks almost like a mini version
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.160]   of the old Mac Pro trash can computer.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:35.640]   And I had it and it had a difficult time,
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.960]   was very stable.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.600]   And supposedly they are replacing those,
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.720]   but I was getting probably with that about 200 megabits down.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:48.720]   You know, on my Comcast, Docs is 3.1 internet service.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:54.040]   I've got gigabit service and the fastest I can get maybe
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.640]   is about 800 megabits on my phone.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.040]   It's like 400.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:01.040]   But with C-band, I mean with mid-band
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.720]   on T-Mobile, what I'm out and about,
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.440]   I get 700 megabits down.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.040]   It's faster than what I get in my living room.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.880]   - That's wild.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:08.720]   That's absolutely wild.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.720]   There are also other companies like Starry Internet
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:15.520]   that are doing home-based internet based on 5G.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.760]   That is from the former area guy.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.880]   - Yes, I loved the area.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.200]   They were great.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.040]   - Oh yeah.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.600]   - Yeah, Starry has been trying,
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.440]   they are in a couple cities right now.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.000]   A lot of people are experimenting with this.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.120]   I'm really wondering like the AR glasses
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.760]   we're all hoping to see in five years.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.360]   - They would need 5G, yeah.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.600]   - Right, right, yeah.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.800]   - They can't just rely on their phones.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.200]   They like have to be smart on their own.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.840]   So I feel like that is the future.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.760]   We're kind of like laying out there.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:45.600]   - What a world we live in.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.560]   It's happened so far.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.080]   By the way, I should point out
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.400]   these 5G-C-band rollouts have happened
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.880]   in 40 countries so far.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:57.240]   In Japan, they've rolled out.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.000]   This is according to AR's Technica.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.920]   And in fact, they're deployed at 4100 megahertz.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   So there's just a 100 megahertz guard band
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.480]   between 5G operations in those altimeters.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.480]   And there have been no claims of interference.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   So I call foul on all of this.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.880]   - It's kind of, it reminds me a little bit of the,
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.040]   you know, turn off your devices before landing thing.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:26.880]   - Yeah.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.080]   - Remember Nick Bilton,
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.200]   who was kind of on a tear and campaigned on this.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.920]   - I remember, he got it changed, right?
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.960]   - Right, right, right.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.720]   - And so you can leave your Wi-Fi on,
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.520]   they still want you to turn off your cellular modems
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.480]   on your phones, but I think a lot of people don't.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.520]   - My guess is actually--
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.960]   - Plans aren't falling out of the sky.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.360]   - The cellulars on your phone should be turned off
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.880]   only because you're flying 600 miles an hour.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.520]   And then you lose all your battery life.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.360]   - The hand drops.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.200]   - Yes, right.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.040]   (imitates flight)
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.360]   - As you fly across the country,
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.760]   are not good for anybody.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.600]   - So--
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.440]   - It should be, tell people it's good for you,
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.680]   save your battery life.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.040]   - Don't, like it's not really about the plane safety.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.600]   - Yeah, it's not plane 70.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.640]   And it's probably, probably has something to do
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.280]   with cell carriers who don't want to have all these handoffs
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.080]   as people fly over.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.840]   - If you're flying that far over, can you get,
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.680]   even get the--
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.200]   - Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.200]   - Sure, totally.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.000]   You're only a few miles high.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.280]   Eight miles high.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.480]   (laughs)
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.840]   You probably can't get ultra wideband, however.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.640]   I don't think you can get that up there.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.000]   Actually, this is, now I'm starting to get the calls.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.360]   I had a guy call me today,
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.560]   said I just got a phone in the mail
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.840]   because from AT&T, because they say
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.880]   my phone's not gonna work in a month.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.280]   AT&T is on O2-2-2-2-2-2,
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.160]   February 22nd of this year,
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.360]   turning off the 3G towers.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.680]   He has a Galaxy S7.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.880]   I said, well wait, that uses LTE,
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.040]   but turns out AT&T is using
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:11.000]   the 3G for call signaling to make the connection.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.040]   So your voice--
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:12.880]   - On that phone.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.880]   - On that phone.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.920]   So it'll just stop working.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.520]   So they said I'm like a $20 crap phone.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.360]   (laughs)
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.520]   Unsolicited.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.040]   I said, you should probably just get a newer.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.600]   But this is gonna be, get ready.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.720]   This is a month from now.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.720]   A lot of people with older, not even that,
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.040]   an S7 isn't that old.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.600]   Well, and one of the big things
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.280]   that doesn't get talked about a lot
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.080]   is a lot of home security systems
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.040]   use a cellular modem that talks on 3G
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.440]   because a lot of them were set up like that
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.440]   and there's not a lot of 4G ones out there
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.120]   and they're gonna have to upgrade their security system.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.360]   - Yeah, a lot of cars have 3G modes.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.520]   - On Star. - On Star.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.960]   - On Star, use 3G.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.800]   So that's the next moment of outrage.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.560]   I just gotta give you a warning.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.720]   2-2, 2-2, 2-0, 2-2.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.280]   - Every decade we'll just have a wave of devices
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.120]   that kind of die.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:10.960]   - Well, that's right.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.000]   That's the future, isn't it?
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.280]   From now on. - Yeah.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.680]   - This is the way it's gonna be, from now on.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.800]   - We lost all the blackberries.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.880]   They're all gone.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.680]   - I have been last a couple of weeks ago.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.520]   - Yeah.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.360]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.680]   - It's okay.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.520]   That's okay.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.120]   Let's see, what else?
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.360]   Intel is gonna build,
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.480]   new president, new factory.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.880]   Intel's gonna build a massive,
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.040]   the largest chip factory ever in Ohio, they say.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.600]   They will build two new semiconductor fabs
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.080]   on a thousand acres site
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.080]   where Intel will research development manufacturer,
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.240]   its latest chips.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.200]   And this is really part of the Intel transition
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.680]   from being an IDF in an integrated design foundry
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.720]   where they design and make their own chips
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.600]   to becoming kind of almost two companies,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.040]   a design company like Nvidia or ARM or Apple,
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.280]   for that matter.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.760]   And then a fabricator, a chip builder like TSMC,
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.080]   they wanna do both.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.960]   And so these new plants, I think,
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.200]   are part of their Pat Gelsinger's mission
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.280]   to start selling their chip manufacturing capacity
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.960]   to other companies, including, they say,
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.000]   aspirationally Apple.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.320]   Very aspirationally.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.960]   Construction begins this year.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.560]   The plant should be operational by 2025.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.520]   So this is, it's really gonna be interesting to watch.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.400]   You know, traditionally companies
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.680]   making this kind of pivot fail.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.040]   It's a hard thing to do.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.800]   And the one prime example is Microsoft,
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.280]   which has really made an amazing pivot
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.360]   and is actually a stronger, better company
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.800]   because they moved from being the Windows office company
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.320]   to being the cloud company.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.960]   It'll be very interesting to see if Intel
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.680]   can make this transition.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.520]   Ben Thompson wrote about it in his trajectory column.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.480]   In fact, that's where I get most of my understanding
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.480]   of what the hell's going on in Intel.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.600]   'Cause it's very, very confusing.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.920]   But he actually years ago said Intel should split
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:06.760]   into two companies.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.000]   This integrated solution is not gonna be a good solution.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   It turns out he was right.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.960]   It was one of the reasons Intel struggled
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.240]   with new technologies.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.280]   They got ossified, fossilized, stuck.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.280]   And because TSMC didn't have to worry about,
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.000]   you know, being an integrated company,
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.600]   they were able to leapfrog them.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.600]   But now Gelsinger has at least decided
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.880]   he's gonna try to change Intel's tune.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.520]   You think they'll succeed, Devinder?
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.120]   - You know, I've been covering Intel for a while
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.320]   in AMD and all the big chip companies.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.800]   It does seem like they've been affected
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.480]   by the innovators dilemma, you know, for a while.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.640]   I think at least within the last decade.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.200]   And now we're seeing AMD come up with like much,
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.320]   much better mobile chips and desktop chips.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.880]   Like the competition's heating up.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.760]   And also with what Apple's doing.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.440]   I think Intel has a chance of doing something
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.000]   really interesting here.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:02.840]   It's a big bet.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:06.240]   And this is kind of the thing Intel has needed to make.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.120]   We just recently saw their 12th gen chips,
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.200]   which have this new like hybrid design,
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.080]   which I think is a really interesting idea.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.080]   And that is something like--
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:13.920]   - This is the idea.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.760]   - This is the big little thing.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.600]   - Yeah.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.440]   - Is this that big little thing
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.880]   where you have efficiency cores and performance cores?
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.920]   And this is-- - Basically, yeah.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.480]   - This is what Apple has done so well with.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.320]   - Yeah.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.160]   - Yeah.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:25.840]   And Snapdragon chips as well.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.680]   - And Qualcomm.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.440]   - Like so, mobile chips have been doing that.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.120]   It is interesting to see that come to laptops, you know,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.000]   and desktops.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.880]   And Intel's leaning in on that.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:39.360]   AMD still has the lead on like actual manufacturing,
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.240]   making them in smaller sizes.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.160]   So Intel's just kind of racing to catch up at that level.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.520]   They kind of have to do something like this.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.360]   You know, it's a big bet.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.360]   And this company just can't keep doing
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.400]   what it's doing right now
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.200]   when Apple can just build mobile chips
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.280]   that blow pretty much all their desktop hardware
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.120]   out of the water.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:57.960]   - Yeah.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.440]   - So, yeah, I can't tell if it'll work,
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.160]   but we need capacity.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.000]   I think the big problem right now
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.560]   that we're facing with the whole
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:08.360]   global chip industry is that we've relied so much on
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.840]   a couple of companies that make all the chips.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.840]   And if something happens in that pipeline,
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.400]   like we're all kind of, so many industries
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.840]   just kind of like start to fall apart.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.120]   So I think it's smart for Intel.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.680]   Clearly there's a demand for this stuff.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.360]   And I think we're like, we're gonna have more
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.240]   and more of a demand for anything
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.440]   that requires chips right now.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.280]   So yeah, it should pay off.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.920]   Even if it's not Intel's own chips being built there.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.880]   - One of the things that Thompson's points out
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.960]   in his article on Stratecary is that Intel actually
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.320]   ended up going to TSMC saying, can you make our chips?
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.160]   - Yep.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.840]   - Which was kind of crazy 'cause here you are.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.360]   This is your biggest competitor.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.520]   And you're actually giving them capital
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.560]   to continue to whoop your ass.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:52.680]   But it actually was maybe part of this transition
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.280]   to kind of two different businesses,
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.840]   the design business and the fab business.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.000]   And the design business needs to get its designs made
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.040]   somewhere and it doesn't have to always be an Intel company.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.400]   It'll be very interesting.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.520]   I think, are they building in Texas too?
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.600]   I think they are.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.200]   - They're building in Arizona as well.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.040]   - They're also in Arizona.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:13.880]   - They're like, right.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.000]   - They're, that is really interesting.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.120]   I'm really interested to see what happens down here
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.480]   in the South too.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.360]   American manufacturing is something that we've kind of
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.080]   just ignored for so long.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.120]   And now that we're thinking hard about where stuff
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.600]   is being built and what we can invest in here now too,
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.960]   they're still trying to pass the chips bill
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.960]   which hasn't gone through the house yet I believe.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.360]   So like there's still things we could be doing
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:43.640]   certainly down here in the South
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.360]   after Rivian announced that they're gonna be building stuff
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.960]   here in Georgia.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.440]   It's gonna be really exciting to see like
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.240]   where manufacturing moves around in the US.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:56.560]   - Yeah, in Texas it's AMD in Austin
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:01.240]   and Samsung also is gonna do chips in Austin.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:04.800]   And one of the things that I think is really interesting
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.680]   and I'm curious about how this will work out
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.680]   is if freeing up Intel from having married manufacturing
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.720]   with design, if it will accelerate the innovation
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.760]   in their design, you know, Intel--
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.080]   - That's the theory, right?
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.160]   - Yes, right, right.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.600]   But how, how would that work?
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.640]   What would, what exactly is the mechanism there
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.080]   that would cause that to happen?
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.400]   - Well, I think the premise, at least Ben's premise
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.760]   is they were being held back because their fab capabilities
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.240]   were not developing at the same speed
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.360]   as their design capability.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.560]   So they couldn't design future chips.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.320]   That's why they ended up getting fab at TSMC.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.240]   Remember Intel couldn't get below 10 nanometers.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.240]   I think they still are struggling to get below 10.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.160]   - To years, yeah.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.320]   - Yeah, so in a way that whatever the design teams wanted
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.480]   to do, they were very much limited
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.440]   about what their fabs could make.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   So this is probably smart to decouple the two.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.280]   Now let's see what the, they've got good designers.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.160]   Gelsinger designed the 486, let's not forget.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.360]   He's a designer by trade.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.200]   He understands this.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.560]   - My first CPU, yeah.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.400]   - Yeah.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.240]   - I will.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.600]   (laughing)
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.720]   - Well, it's, the one thing about this is though,
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.040]   is that, is it if their limitation was the fabs
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.240]   and their capabilities impacting their design,
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.040]   where, where will Intel the design company go?
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:26.880]   Aren't they?
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.720]   - TSMC.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:28.560]   (laughing)
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.520]   - But, but TSMC won't have the capacity to them.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.360]   - They may not.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.160]   - Apple buys up all their capacity.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.000]   - Yeah.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.360]   - It happens. - Building more too.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.560]   - They are building a lot more.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.680]   - Right, but so, so, but what is to keep Intel
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.080]   from just keep going back to Intel now
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.560]   as an independent company and still having that limitation?
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.680]   - Well, that's, that's gonna be one
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.920]   of the potential pitfalls.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.920]   And as I said, these pivots traditionally don't go so well.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.240]   (laughing)
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.080]   - Right.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.680]   - There's a long history of failed pivots like this,
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.560]   but splits, you know, split.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.200]   You want to get most interesting splits right now,
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.640]   I think, is HP and HPE.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.960]   - That's gone great, hasn't it?
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.120]   - That has gone great.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.520]   HPE will last.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.000]   - Well, HPE.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:12.840]   - Yeah.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.920]   - It has, I mean, look at the HP's making the HP division.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.760]   - Sure.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.000]   - It's making its best best piece ever.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.160]   I don't know how well HPE is doing the enterprise division,
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.000]   but my sense is it's not doing badly.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.480]   Why did you laugh?
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.840]   Is it bad?
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.680]   - I'm thinking, I'm thinking,
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.080]   maybe I'm thinking back to like HPE
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.560]   from several years ago.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.400]   - I don't know.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.240]   - Oh, no.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.080]   - Yeah.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:32.920]   - They've made a good recovery.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.480]   And they've gotten pretty good
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.640]   with selling cloud computing servers there.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.280]   They sell a variety of services.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.080]   They have moved here to Houston.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.360]   The company is now based in Houston.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.400]   And what's interesting is a lot of the people,
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.280]   the older executives are from the old compact days
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.080]   when they were building servers here.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.400]   So it's kind of been, in fact, Antonio Neri,
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.240]   who is the CEO, worked here
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.240]   and was part of the compact server group and HP.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.440]   When HPE had it.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   And so it's kind of a homecoming for them.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.080]   They're doing pretty well from what I could tell.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.440]   - I'm remembering that awful deal.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.560]   They made remember with Autonomy.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.400]   - Yes.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.320]   - It's like that is the last major headline in my head.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.160]   But yeah.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.000]   - Yeah, that was HPE.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.760]   - That's Leo Apotheca.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.920]   And that was why HPE and HPE split really.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.760]   - Yeah, right.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:30.080]   - That was the straw that broke the camel's back.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.280]   - I'm looking at HPE's stock over the last five years.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.120]   And it's pretty flat.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.200]   It's not going through the roof.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.120]   It looks a lot like Microsoft did before it's pivot.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.520]   But I do have to say, at least from the consumer side,
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.000]   HP is making the best computers they've made in years.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.880]   Really much nicer, much more interesting design.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.520]   - Really good, better than what Lenovo and some other
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.360]   - Absolutely. - of the these are doing.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.200]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.600]   Lenovo has gone real downhill.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.440]   - Yeah.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.680]   So maybe the story really is that they got rid of that
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.680]   lead balloon called HPE and they could finally do their--
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:00.880]   - They got rid of the inner primes.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.120]   - I feel like that's kind of it.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.720]   At least it's the way I've been doing it.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.480]   - Yeah, maybe that's really the story.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.320]   Let's take a little break.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.120]   We'll have more Davender Harder War and Gadget.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.080]   Wonderful to have you.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.680]   How's the baby?
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.520]   - She's good.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.840]   She's three.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.920]   She turned three in October.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.360]   - We tried to do this show during nap time.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.480]   - During, I mean, no, it's dinner time now.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.800]   My wife has to do dinner and baby put down.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.280]   - It's always rough, but my wife also likes
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.440]   your work Leo so, you know,
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.280]   she knows it's rough.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.640]   - Oh, that's nice of her.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.000]   It helps put the baby to sleep.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:34.840]   - Anything for Leo.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.320]   - That's the motto.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.840]   - It puts the baby to sleep.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.400]   We know the real reason.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.600]   Dwight Silverman also here.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.560]   You're, are you back at the Chronicle?
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.240]   I see you're byline at the Chronicle again.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.400]   What's going on, Dwight?
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.360]   - Well, I'm doing, I am freelancing my column.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.760]   So it's still there once a week.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.560]   And it's essentially what it was before I retired
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.400]   and then went to Forbes for seven months.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.960]   - Your retirement is--
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.800]   - I know.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.200]   - It's gonna be, it's like Frank Sinatra.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.760]   I think it's--
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.320]   - I have on most of my social media bios,
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.440]   not good at retirement.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.560]   And that's true.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.640]   - I love playing it, good for you.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.480]   - That's true.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.800]   Well, and, but the other fun thing is that,
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:20.240]   you know, I have found that I am incredibly busy
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.320]   with my free time.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.960]   It's not like I'm like sitting around, you know,
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.200]   binging Netflix, although when we're done,
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.200]   I gotta go finish watching Ozark.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.040]   But--
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.760]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.480]   - But, but it's like, I'm incredibly busy with life.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.600]   And so it's pretty wonderful.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.560]   - You know, it's funny 'cause I talk a lot about retiring
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.080]   and, you know, I'm 65.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.840]   It's when you would normally take the gold--
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.400]   - With the same age, yep.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.440]   - Get the little banquet.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.360]   They'd say, "You were great for last 40 years.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.200]   Goodbye."
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:54.000]   And now, and then so I'm kind of looking at this idea.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.040]   And now I'm thinking, I know, I don't, what would I do?
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:57.880]   - That'd be boring.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.480]   - Well, but it would too.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.640]   - I would do it if you're still having fun, you know,
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.480]   and you still--
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.800]   - I think you're doing so good.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.000]   - This isn't exactly work.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.600]   I mean, it's not like I'm digging ditches or, you know,
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.080]   layin' railroad tracks.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.600]   I'm just sitting here in a chair, gassing.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.440]   So--
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.000]   (laughing)
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.680]   - It's not even that what this is.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.520]   - Yeah, that's what this is.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.440]   It's not even as hard as writing.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.800]   It's like, just--
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.080]   (laughing)
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.080]   So I'm figuring, you know, okay, as long as people
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.880]   have me, I'll probably end up doing this for a long time.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:29.720]   Oh, sorry, John.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.960]   John wants to retire, but I, we're gonna stick around
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.800]   for a little bit.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.800]   Anyway, if you wanna see all of Dwight's writing,
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.360]   he's got it all under one roof now, which is kind of cool.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   This is authorry, A-U-T-H-O-R-Y.com/d-silverman.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.000]   And so you are keepin' busy.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.200]   There's quite a few articles here.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.040]   So you--
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.640]   - Yeah, this is a subscription service.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.160]   Subscription for you, not for the--
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.560]   - For me, right, right, right.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.760]   But there's no ads on it.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.480]   You can go in there, it actually will set up as like an email.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.320]   - Oh, that's nice.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.600]   - When I have a new story, it aggregates from all
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.720]   of my past work and anything I do now,
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.160]   it's, if you're a freelancer who writes
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.280]   at a lot of different places, it is a great way
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.000]   to have everything all in one place.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.800]   I'm not getting any money for saying that.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:21.880]   It's just as--
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:22.720]   - Oh, we're givin' them.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.560]   - It's a problem.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.400]   - Yeah.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.800]   - If it was a problem I had and they solved it for me.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.640]   - Nice.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.480]   Well, I'm really glad.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.000]   It actually is a great solution.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.920]   If the Vorek had done that, they'd be page after page after page.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.880]   (laughing)
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:37.720]   All right, thank you.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.720]   It's good to have Dwight and DeVindra here.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.280]   I show today always pleased to welcome New Relic
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.440]   to our show as our sponsor.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.040]   I am, I've known about New Relic since back in the day
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.840]   when they were a Ruby on Rails solution.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.160]   These days, New Relic is just a must-have
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.120]   for anybody who's gotta keep a stack running.
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:01.360]   You know how that feels, that nine o'clock call
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.760]   or maybe three a.m. call, when you're,
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.000]   you know, you're kind of winding down,
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.320]   maybe watching a little Ozark and the phone rings
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.280]   and something's down, something's broken.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.120]   And you're going, what is it, what could it be?
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.920]   Is it that fix I just pushed?
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.320]   Is the back end?
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.160]   Is the front end?
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.000]   Is it global?
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:20.840]   Is it the server?
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.680]   Is it the network?
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.240]   Is it the cloud provider?
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.880]   Do we have slow running queries?
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.200]   And now suddenly you've got a team scrambling.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.800]   They're going from tool to tool.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.120]   They're slackin' you.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.040]   They're callin' you.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.000]   They're buzzing your beeper.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.400]   Try to figure out what's goin' on.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.520]   It's just like an anneal that somebody just kicked.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.200]   If only you had a system for figuring out
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.360]   what's goin' wrong.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.840]   Weirdly enough, such a thing exists.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.080]   They call it observability.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.400]   New Relic just did a report.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.520]   Only half of all organizations
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:53.880]   are implementing observability for their network and systems.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   And it's a huge issue that you can solve with New Relic.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:04.360]   New Relic is a umbrella for 16 different monitoring products.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.200]   You'd buy 'em separately, maybe you'd try to make 'em work together,
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.440]   but you don't have to.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.120]   With New Relic, you'll get application monitoring, APM.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.040]   So you can build New Relic into your tooling
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.560]   across the board, apps, microservices.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.640]   In fact, it's so good that if you have an error in your code,
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.960]   it can tell you the line number.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.160]   It can tell you where your stack's doing.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.960]   You can get an instant feedback,
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.040]   which makes it much easier to fix what's wrong.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.120]   You get, if you use Kubernetes, you'll love PIXI
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.280]   for observability, distributed tracing.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.360]   You see you can see all your traces
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.440]   without management headaches, find and fix issues fast,
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.880]   network performance monitoring,
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.560]   stop guessing where performance issues start,
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:50.360]   ditch data silos for a system-wide correlated view.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.240]   It's so much more.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.080]   There's 16 tools, that's just four of them.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.040]   And I love it that you can know instantly, exactly.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.720]   Look at the companies that use New Relic,
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:06.200]   14,000 companies, DoorDash, GitHub, CloudFlare, Atlassian, Epic, Games.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.360]   Everybody loves New Relic because it solves that problem
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.400]   with the IPM phone call.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.200]   You can push a button, see what's wrong,
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.400]   and fix it and go back to Ozark.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.920]   Or whatever you're doing, you can be knitting, I don't care.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.800]   Whether you run a cloud native startup or a Fortune 500 company,
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.560]   it takes five minutes to start New Relic up,
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.640]   get it going in your environment, and get ready for this.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   No credit card required.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.600]   You get 100 gigabytes of data free forever.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.560]   And for many people, that's plenty.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:38.000]   If you need more, you can get more.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.720]   But you really want to get New Relic.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.160]   Before that 9 p.m. call, it's just out there waiting to happen.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.960]   Get New Relic before it does.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.520]   Sign up at New Relic.com/twit.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.320]   N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C.com/twit.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.760]   And if you're boss and you want to see some smiles, ask your team.
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.640]   Hey, what guys do we need New Relic?
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.920]   Oh boy.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.440]   They'll go, "Yes."
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.080]   We thought you'd never ask.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:04.840]   Or more likely they'll say, "Yeah, we've been using it.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.480]   You want to get more?"
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.240]   New Relic.com/twit.
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.000]   N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.560]   New Relic.com/twit.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.360]   I love this company.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.000]   I love these guys.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.320]   And they do such a good job.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.600]   And you definitely need it.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.280]   New Relic.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.480]   OK.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.640]   Oh, I wanted to ask you--
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.680]   I'm asking everybody.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.120]   This is Pixel 6 Week.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.760]   We got the January update.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.800]   I know, Devindra, you've covered it.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.320]   I see Dwight.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.680]   You've covered it.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.600]   Has it fixed your--
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.320]   Personally, I love the Pixel 6.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.560]   I've not had any problems.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.120]   Fingerprint reader works great.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.320]   Never stops, never crashes.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.320]   I just love it.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.440]   But everybody I know hates it.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.240]   How's your Pixel 6 these days, Devindra?
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:48.560]   I know.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.400]   I actually don't have one.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.240]   I think I wrote up a piece of that news.
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.160]   But yeah, I want to play with it, because it looks like the most
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.320]   interesting song people have made.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.520]   Oh, such a camera.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.760]   I honestly think there's hardware issues or a QC issue,
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.360]   because I don't have the problems a lot of people report.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.440]   Mary Jo Foley says the fingerprint reader doesn't work for her.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.360]   I had somebody call today on the radio show, said, yeah,
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.960]   it doesn't even ask for a fingerprint.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.680]   It just sits there.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:18.760]   I had a review unit, and I did not have any of the problems
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.200]   with the review unit that other folks had.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:26.720]   I did not get it from Google, and I got it from a carrier.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:30.240]   But I did not have any problems with it.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.480]   I liked the phone.
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:33.240]   I had to send it back so I don't get a chance
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.320]   to see what the updates are like.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:39.040]   And by the way, if you hear any crinkling or other sounds,
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.520]   my cat got into the room, and he's in--
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.080]   That's OK.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.080]   I heard some meowing.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:43.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.320]   Yes, yes.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.680]   He's in the room, and maybe he'll be quiet,
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.680]   but he's in this--
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.160]   OK, we love his--
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.920]   --kind of tube.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.280]   And so there's a little crinkle on here.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:54.360]   And he made jump on me.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.120]   He likes to get right here.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.760]   Are you actually in the cats?
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.520]   I think you're in the cat's room.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.000]   I am in the cat's room, and that's why they're mad.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.440]   That's why they were trying to get in his room.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.440]   This is my wife's office.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:11.160]   And when she is in here, they sit on her lap,
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.760]   and she's a psychotherapist in those Zoom sessions.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.960]   And so her clients are used to her.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.440]   So you may see Milo on my chest.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.080]   OK.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:24.720]   Well, all right.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.080]   So I guess nothing to say.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.840]   I mean, the January update is out.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.440]   It's rolled out.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.200]   We'll talk more about it.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:29.920]   I'm sure on Twig.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.800]   I'm curious, because Aunt Pruitt's had a lot of problems.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:34.560]   I'm curious if it fixes any of his problems.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.600]   This was the update that was supposed to come out last month.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.040]   It's such a shame, because this was supposed
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.840]   to be the iPhone killer for them, right?
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.320]   Like, it so much seemed good.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.640]   I was like, as an iOS user, I was like really jealous
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.360]   of some of the things I was seeing on that phone.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.240]   And then this is happening.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.680]   And it just kind of reminds me that Google's so bad.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.000]   It can see more products sometimes.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.760]   Like, so many things are so bad.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.120]   I have a Nest thermoset that is always
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.360]   losing its internet connection.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.480]   I don't know why.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.840]   So yeah.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.200]   It's interesting.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.800]   It's not an iPhone killer.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.320]   It's a good phone.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:10.640]   It is probably the best phone that Google has done.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:16.480]   But it is not an iPhone killer, mainly because while Google
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.520]   has created a really decent piece of hardware,
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.760]   and Android 12 is interesting, Android 12
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.840]   is just not as easy to use as iOS still.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:30.400]   And so to be able to pick it up and kind of do the things
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.800]   that Google Touts isn't necessarily always
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.960]   the simplest thing to do.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.320]   I honestly think that that's the selling point.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.040]   Believe it or not.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.040]   The iPhone is just what the iPhone is.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.080]   The iPhone is what it is.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.480]   Don't mess with it because that's you can't.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.240]   And that's not the case now.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.720]   It's not the case now.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.960]   That's not the case now.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:54.360]   I mean, I think you could really customize an iPhone now.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.080]   I mean, right down to the degree that you can.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.680]   No, no, not to the degree.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:04.040]   But it's beginning with kind of the stuff with shortcuts
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:07.280]   and the ability to change even the look of the phone.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.400]   So it looks completely different.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.320]   Short cuts made the iPhone a lot harder to use.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.160]   You know what else made the iPhone harder to use?
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.800]   Is this new focus feature?
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.760]   I felt terrible the other night.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.280]   Lisa is desperately trying to figure out
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.600]   how to only allow text messages from her son.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.400]   He's Michael's down the hall from us.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:30.360]   But he has COVID who sealed his door with caulking.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.040]   So we want to be if he needs something,
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:35.040]   we want to know how to slide something under the door or whatever.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.880]   And it's like, you know, it's bedtime.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.840]   I'm going to sleep.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.040]   She says, I can't figure out this focus thing.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.280]   Could you help me?
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.600]   And I'm saying the tech guy doesn't take calls after 9 p.m.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.960]   Go away.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.680]   I've helped light his clothes.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.120]   I've helped light his clothes.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.600]   I don't want to help you.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.080]   But it's not because I don't want to help her.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.240]   It's because it is hard to figure out.
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.440]   I can't figure out for the life of it.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.440]   The focus mode stuff is super unintuitive.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.360]   And what I'm saying is more like the iPhone is
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.040]   a perfect expression of Apple's hardware and software.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.480]   I kind of felt like Pixel 6 was going to be that, even if it's not.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:09.960]   It did not.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.560]   It's not.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.120]   It's still even that.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.440]   I mean, but that's why I like Android
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.200]   because it is very kind of infinitely customizable.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.440]   And that's one of the features of Android 12 is, you know,
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.800]   your wallpaper changes the colors on your phone
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.960]   and things like that.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.360]   It's nothing Apple would ever do.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.880]   And I'm not sure I want it to do that.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.880]   Yeah, don't accept it.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.120]   You know, I'm not sure.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:31.840]   Well, it's right.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.360]   Leave my phone alone.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.720]   All right.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.400]   Moving on.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.480]   Get off my phone.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.040]   Get off my phone.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.680]   I don't want to get out of there.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.760]   Shit.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.280]   You know, it's really-- I want to use the Pixel 6.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.560]   I have a Samsung SmartWatch.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.880]   I use Linux.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.520]   I want to be in a-- but the problem is the Apple ecosystem
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.840]   is so integrated.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.360]   You can't use an Apple watch with it.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.440]   And I want to use it.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:06.040]   So it ends up just sucking you into this all Apple ecosystem,
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:06.960]   which I'm not happy.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.160]   I don't think that's the right thing.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.120]   But I mean, isn't that what we want?
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.320]   We want easy to use.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:12.720]   Yes.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.600]   Easy to use.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.640]   Hardware and gadgets and software and everything integrated.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.840]   And you give up a little freedom for that.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.440]   But I sure love the ability to just like, you know,
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.080]   just pop up in my laptop and--
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.480]   That's a slippery slope.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.280]   Slippery slope.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.840]   He who is willing to give up a little freedom
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.040]   for ease of use.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.240]   I think Ben Franklin said this, didn't he?
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:33.800]   That's right.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:34.480]   That's right.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.800]   Not a smart phone if he could keep it.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.360]   Tyranny.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.560]   IRS, this is going to be really interesting
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.560]   to see how people react to this.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:48.760]   Is going to start requiring face recognition scans
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.000]   to access your taxes online.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.520]   That's going to happen this year.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:59.080]   They're using a service company called ID.me.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.920]   Starting in summer 2022.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.520]   And this is-- you know, it's all about security, right?
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.640]   But this is going beyond two factor.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:12.760]   You'll have to create an account with ID.me.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:18.120]   And you will have to send them a scan of your driver's license
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.640]   or a government-issued ID.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.920]   You'll have to prove you are you.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.600]   Copies of utility or insurance bills.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.880]   Maybe they'll ask you questions about your mobile phone
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:27.600]   service.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.880]   But it's going a lot farther to say you are you.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.240]   And I guess this is all because I guess the IRS is experiencing
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:34.800]   a lot of fraud.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.480]   I don't know.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.480]   It says 27 states are using ID.me.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.320]   This is from Krebs on Security.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:48.200]   27 states use ID.me because of identity theft with benefits
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.720]   is becoming such a problem.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:54.000]   But I think people are going to go, well, you want me what?
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.240]   And sometimes you have to do a video of yourself,
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.840]   a selfie video of yourself, a live video chat.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.720]   What do you think?
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.320]   I mean, on the one hand, this is smart for security.
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:14.360]   But boy, ID.me is going to have all of our information.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.680]   It's also complicated.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.560]   And for people who aren't--
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.440]   there are people who are not necessarily tech savvy
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:28.000]   that use online filing for their taxes
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.960]   and online access for their taxes.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.480]   That may be the most advanced thing they do.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.800]   But for them, this is just going to--
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.760]   I have a feeling this will not stand.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.640]   This will not be immediately required.
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:41.600]   I think it'll be optional.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.320]   And maybe you'll work into it over time.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.520]   But this won't stand.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.920]   This seems like it's an ongoing story
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.960]   because actually last fall they announced
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.560]   that there would be some sort of stronger biometric
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.600]   authentication.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.840]   But I was looking at some of the reporting from this past week.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:02.200]   And even the IRS is saying, it's not true.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:07.320]   You don't have to submit facial authentication file
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.120]   or pay your taxes for you.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.120]   That's more reasonable.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:10.920]   That's more reasonable.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.440]   Maybe they're in the process of setting this up.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:16.360]   And there's certainly issues with relying on a single company
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:16.880]   to do this.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:18.160]   But yeah, I--
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.240]   Especially private company.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:26.120]   All right, so maybe it isn't going to happen this summer,
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:31.440]   although if you go to the sign-in page, it says it is.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.880]   So I don't--
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:33.400]   You know, this is--
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.160]   There's a comment from the IRS and the Gizmodo thing
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.280]   that you guys have linked to.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.320]   So there's Way at the bottom.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.120]   And then it seems like the spokesperson misspoke
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:42.560]   at the beginning.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.320]   No, no, but no.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.800]   This is an IRS page.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.680]   We are bringing you an improved sign-in experience.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.200]   You won't be able to log in with your existing IRS username
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:52.720]   and password starting in summer 2022.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.760]   If you're a new user, please create an account with id.me.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.200]   This is not a spokesperson.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.680]   This is their site.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.400]   I'm very confused.
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:05.360]   You can e-file without uploading a cell feed or any of that.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.000]   So some things you'll have to--
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.040]   Some things you'll have to do.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.240]   And that makes sense because not everybody
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.160]   has a smartphone or a laptop with a camera.
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.920]   I mean, now if you're just a normal person,
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:18.720]   what are you going to--
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.640]   You have to go down to a drug store or something
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.840]   and borrow somebody's smartphone.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.760]   It doesn't--
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.240]   Please notarize my IRS authentication.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.560]   That's right.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:33.560]   IRS told Gizmodo that users can still receive basic information
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:36.040]   from the website with log in.
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.720]   But added, they will need to sign in through id.me
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:42.160]   to make and view payments, access tax records, viewer
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.320]   create payment plans, manage communications preference,
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.520]   or view tax professional authorizations.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.880]   Then the IRS spokesperson later said the information
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.360]   he provided was not accurate.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.360]   This sounds like a government around situation.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:05.040]   I wonder if there's any way that they could--
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.360]   If there's any way that the IRS could leverage the biometrics
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:17.200]   built into things like Windows Hello or the iPhone.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:20.040]   Well, so that you don't have to use something like id.me.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:20.400]   But--
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.240]   That's true.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:21.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:25.040]   Where you essentially create a hash with Face ID,
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.440]   and that is used to log in.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:26.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.400]   That would require government that can actually
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.720]   build those things.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:30.280]   And--
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:30.780]   Yes.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:31.800]   And it would also require--
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:31.800]   Apples.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.800]   --immunicating.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.680]   I am going to give credit also.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.040]   Because we've had so many terrible government websites
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.080]   going back to the ACA and everything.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.480]   But did you get your COVID tests?
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.480]   I filed it.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.360]   They failed today.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:43.760]   Did you--
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:44.440]   --came?
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.920]   How fast that site is, how well it worked.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.600]   Yes.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.400]   And they came.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:53.640]   I got my yesterday.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:56.000]   I don't know who set this up.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.360]   But it's a snappy site.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.280]   It's easy to order.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:01.040]   And you've got to figure there's a lot of people
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:01.440]   using it.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:05.040]   Actually, the US government actually has--
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.080]   and I can't remember what the address was--
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.920]   but has an analytics site that's open to all.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.080]   Let me see if it's analytics.
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:14.080]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.000]   The data.gov.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.360]   The USA.gov.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.840]   Yeah, you can see this.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.640]   So this is--
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:24.880]   if you can narrow it down to just the Postal Service, which
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.560]   is, I guess, what's running this.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.440]   Yes.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.320]   It was more than a quarter of a million
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.240]   when I went there on Wednesday.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.040]   There are 1.29 billion visits to the Postal Service
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.000]   over the last 90 days.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.200]   This is actually really a great trove of information here.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.880]   Right now, there are a quarter of a million people
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.800]   on government websites right now.
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:50.800]   Number one, USPS, then COVID Home Test, then USPS, then COVID
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.400]   tests, and then login.gov.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:57.560]   So the vast bulk of it is people getting COVID tests right now.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.440]   It's surprisingly good.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.480]   I wish it had come last year when we did tests.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.040]   It's a little late before the waves.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:03.520]   But yeah.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   OK.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:08.160]   It's better than never.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:09.840]   I don't know if it's US digital services.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.680]   I have to find out who designed that.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.160]   Because that site is fast.
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:13.800]   It's reliable.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:18.360]   And even at the peak, right after it was just announced,
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.160]   it didn't crash.
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.440]   It didn't crash.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.600]   I'm sure there was a lot of pressure
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.040]   to make sure that site worked.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:27.240]   Because it's like, we can't ensure election laws.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:30.360]   But we can make sure people get their COVID tests.
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:30.880]   OK.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:30.920]   Good.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.400]   OK.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.520]   Let's do something right.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.240]   So I just want to say credit where credit's due.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.280]   Because you're right.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.640]   Not a great history of government websites and technology.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.400]   This one worked pretty well.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.200]   And by the way, they're using log4j
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:50.080]   to keep track of all the logins so you can be sure.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.080]   No, I don't know.
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.240]   I hope not.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.040]   Let's cross your fingers.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.680]   Speaking of government, Senate committee
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:06.960]   has voted to advance the Amy Klobuchar, Marsha Blackburn,
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.920]   anti-trust bill.
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.680]   It was in the Judiciary Committee
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.360]   past Thursday 16 to 6.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.320]   This is the American Innovation and Choice Online
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:22.440]   Act that requires companies like Amazon, Google, Apple,
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:28.560]   do not favor their own products in their search results.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.640]   Surprising that they could get a bipartisan agreement
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:33.040]   on anything.
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.960]   I think it's the one thing Democrats and Republicans
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.480]   can agree on now.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.160]   You agree on big tech is the product.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.440]   A hundred amendments were offered at the start of markup.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.480]   The markup is only three hours, but only a handful were debated.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:46.280]   They were able to move it through pretty quickly.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.040]   Now, I'm not sure--
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.440]   I mean, that's another step.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.560]   I'm not sure what the next steps are,
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:56.040]   because I did not watch Schoolhouse Rock.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.600]   So I do not know how a bill becomes law.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.480]   But even CNBC says the bill's path
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:07.400]   to approval by the full Senate is still murky.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:13.000]   There's something happening on the House side too.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.760]   Yes, they're doing the same thing on that side,
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:17.520]   then they do a reconciliation.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:25.560]   Basically, Mitch McConnell has to say, OK, we'll let you vote on that.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.160]   So it's not just Mitch.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.240]   I don't even know who's in charge anymore.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.400]   Is it Chuck Schumer?
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.200]   Schumer, Chuck Schumer.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.280]   But he's in charge.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.880]   It's kind of a joint sharing thing.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:41.160]   So they have to bring it up for a vote.
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:45.600]   But meanwhile, boy, our Apple, Google, Microsoft,
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.200]   lobbying like crazy.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.640]   Ted Cruz, this must have been a hell of a phone call, had a 40--
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:54.000]   he said this at the market-- about a 40 minute phone call
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.920]   with Tim Cook to discuss it.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.440]   I just--
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.200]   It's just Tim Cook saying the same thing over and over again.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:00.640]   But Ted--
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.120]   That's right.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:01.880]   No, no, Ted.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.200]   This is--
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.200]   This is--
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.240]   But Ted.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:08.280]   Of course--
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.440]   How do you feel Apple again?
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:14.160]   Apple's point of view is if you pass this,
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.480]   then our app store will--
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.280]   the security will be harmed.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:22.480]   It'll make it harder for Apple to let consumers out
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.840]   of monitoring from apps.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.240]   Check that IDFA box.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.760]   Cruz said, I don't think that's the case.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.320]   Big lobbying against this, which probably means it's
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.280]   the right thing to do.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:34.920]   I would guess.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.160]   I don't know.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.360]   I don't know.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.400]   But it passed with a very big majority.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.560]   So we shall see.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.800]   It'd be interesting if they actually start--
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.160]   if this all goes through and becomes law,
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.240]   and we're actually looking at what these companies are
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:51.720]   doing more crucially, too.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:54.720]   I think it's targeting companies with a ton of users,
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.880]   like a large amount of users--
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.080]   Big tech.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.080]   --you have big tech.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.600]   Big, big, big tech that has markets way
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.920]   and then can help to avoid things like the way Google
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:05.680]   can prioritize their own links or Amazon can prioritize
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.360]   their own products within their search.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.040]   Because it's something I look at.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.400]   I see it happening in front of me.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.720]   And then I see Amazon starting to make products that I know
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:15.400]   were being sold by other companies.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:16.880]   And I surrender Amazon basics.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.880]   And it's like, all this stuff is happening.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.160]   And we are just powerless to stop these giant companies
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.200]   from absorbing everything and making everything their own.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.400]   We need to do more.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.640]   So I hope this leads to something.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.280]   Mixed feelings about this.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.680]   I don't know what the right thing to do is.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:34.640]   I agree.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.200]   I mean, I would like--
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.400]   Too much power.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:41.160]   We all would like better control over our data.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:46.920]   But I also don't fully trust Congress' motivations here.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.880]   Some of it seems to be more like we
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:53.080]   want to knock down Section 230 and we
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.720]   don't want to be censored on Twitter.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.880]   Oh, they're always trying to stick that in.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.400]   So I just-- I'm very mixed feelings.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.760]   But there's also--
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.640]   there's also benefits to this.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:09.520]   For example, my daughter is furnishing a town home.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.320]   She needed to do a new garbage can.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.400]   She bought one.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.200]   I saw it.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.640]   I said, oh, that's a simple human can.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.640]   It's very slick for designers.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:20.880]   And you know what?
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.440]   It's Amazon basics.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.840]   She paid about a half of it.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.160]   And it looks very much like simple human.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.640]   And it's paid for quality.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:30.880]   And it's less expensive.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:31.880]   But why--
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.280]   There's a benefit to that.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:36.200]   But grocery stores have been doing this for years.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.040]   Right.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.600]   Why is it somehow different if Amazon does it?
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.800]   Amazon-- I mean, Amazon sees the data too of what's happening.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.240]   And they also--
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.280]   I think they have more data than--
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.000]   So do the grocery stores.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.640]   They know how much olive oil they sell.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:55.280]   And they could have a house brand olive oil.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:58.280]   They sell access to the end caps.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.560]   That's actually grocery stores make most of their money,
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.760]   not by selling you groceries, but by selling products.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:03.760]   So like products.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.240]   Product placement.
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.960]   And Costco and others put their names on things that are actually manufactured
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.480]   at their brand places too.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.480]   You're like, yeah, it's something that's
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.480]   having some work.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.760]   Is it tech singled out for doing something that everybody else has done?
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:16.760]   Just because they're big?
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:17.640]   I think it's a scale.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.160]   It is.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:18.160]   It is.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.160]   It's a scale.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.160]   And we've talked about this before, too.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.040]   Nobody elected Mark Zuckerberg to be a leader of the world internet.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.680]   But that's essentially what he has become.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:28.600]   And we are powerless.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.160]   We are powerless against what Facebook is doing.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.080]   And other countries-- like these things have blown up so much that,
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:38.760]   I think at the very least, government kind of wants some controls
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.880]   or some ability to push back.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.880]   And we can't-- we've seen what happens when industry, especially
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.680]   in America, is fully untapped.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.840]   And it has full control over everything.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.240]   So there needs to be a conversation.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:51.440]   I do not have any government.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.880]   I'm not a knee jerk anti-government guy.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.640]   And I don't go along with the people who say, well, the government can't possibly
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.720]   figure out how to regulate this because they're so old fashioned.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:01.720]   No.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:02.720]   We have roads.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:03.720]   This is the will of the people.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.520]   We have traffic signals.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.520]   We have seat belts.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.520]   We could figure this out.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.800]   This is tech and government working together to save lives and make things better for consumers.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.080]   But I want to always work.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.040]   But I want it to make--
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:14.840]   That's exactly it.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.560]   I want it to make it better for consumers, not worse.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:20.880]   And Apple's contention, and of course, is in their self-interest,
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.000]   is, well, this is just going to make things worse.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.640]   You don't understand the unintended consequences.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.200]   It's just going to make things worse.
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.800]   We need to highlight our own apps before other apps.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.800]   It's important.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:31.800]   It's flowable.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:38.200]   Well, so I would say, Devinda, I would take exception to the notion that Mark Zuckerberg
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:42.080]   is the de facto king of the internet, and there's nothing we could do about it.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:45.160]   You don't have to use Facebook.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.320]   But you are using Facebook, right?
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.160]   Like, here, this is the thing we know.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.640]   If you delete your account, and other people still have you tagged--
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:54.640]   Let's Facebook using you.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.640]   That's Facebook using you.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:02.640]   And so-- but you don't have to use Facebook to access news stories,
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.640]   to communicate with your friends, to get the news of the day.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]   It depends on where you are.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640]   You can turn it off.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:12.640]   If you're in a lot of international countries,
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.240]   WhatsApp is the de facto way you talk with each other.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.640]   And Facebook has done a lot of work to make sure, hey, we are the prior--
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.640]   like, we're the way companies-- we're the way people communicate, right?
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.640]   We have subsidized internet in other countries and things like that.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.640]   There are a lot of ways Facebook is basically underlying communication
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:29.640]   throughout the world.
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:33.640]   And it's not as simple as just saying, stop using WhatsApp if your family's in Asia
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.640]   or something, because you kind of have to.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.640]   The Justice Department-- we talked about this on-- I think it was on Twig on Wednesday.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:48.640]   And the FTC are asking a request for comment about how they should treat mergers.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:52.640]   Right, this also came up when we were talking about activation.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.640]   Okay.
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.640]   Can't convince it Microsoft.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.640]   So part of this is that the antitrust laws, the Sherman Antitrust Act,
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.640]   and what's the other one's name?
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.640]   I can't remember, are a little antiquated.
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.640]   And so their question is, how does this change-- has the modern world change
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   what we should-- how we should treat this?
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.640]   In other words, traditionally we've considered consumer harm.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:25.640]   But are there harms that perhaps are more subtle that we don't pay attention to?
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:33.640]   Things like reducing innovation, which, you know, that's a serious concern.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:37.640]   And also this issue of-- and this is a complicated one--
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.640]   monopsony power.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.640]   If-- so, the idea of monopoly is one seller to many consumers.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.640]   Monopsony is the opposite.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:48.640]   There's only one buyer.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.640]   And this is a particular issue in the labor market.
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:54.640]   If there's one big company, is the only company hiring engineers,
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:57.640]   then they have huge power over that market.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.640]   And so they're trying to understand that a little bit better.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:08.640]   That's a big monopsony, I believe, was Alina Khan issue when she was a professor.
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.640]   She's, of course, the new chairman of the FTC and has written-- wrote papers
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:18.640]   as an academic complaining about the power of Facebook.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.640]   She's the one who's basically like, yeah, deconstructed the way Amazon works and says
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:27.640]   why it's anti-consumer, even though the regular argument is like, yeah, sure, prices are cheaper.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:28.640]   So it's better.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:29.640]   Right.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:30.640]   Right.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.640]   But I think it is more complicated than that.
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:35.640]   And yeah, I hope she ends up doing great work at the FTC.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:40.640]   But Leo, I mean, you probably remember how hard the government was against mergers
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:43.640]   like back in the what '60s and '72, right?
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:48.640]   Like, I remember like, I've read stories about like grocery stores in California.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.640]   And how much the government was like, these two tiny little chains can't come together
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.640]   because it would be a percentage too much.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.640]   I think it all changed under in the Reagan era.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:01.640]   Mm-hmm.
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   In the late '80s and early '90s under Bush as well.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:12.640]   And even Clinton, where they just did not as aggressively pursue litigation against mergers.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:13.640]   Yeah, greed is good.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:14.640]   Yeah, greed is good.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.640]   Yeah, greed is good.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:16.640]   That's right.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.640]   Right.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:23.640]   But then preceding that, preceding that was the AT&T breakup, which was kind of the undoing
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:29.640]   of that, which to interestingly, AT&T is kind of reconstituted, but it's not the power
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   that it once was.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:36.640]   But that was kind of the pinnacle of that era of trust busting.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:39.640]   Threats to potential competition.
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:45.640]   That's, of course, the accusation against Facebook buying Instagram and what's happened
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:49.640]   is to prevent Instagram was tiny when they bought it.
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:52.640]   Why would the FTC have prevented that merger?
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:55.640]   Well, because it was taking a nascent competitor out of the market.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.640]   And so they want to consider that as well.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.640]   And that one is kind of tough to you because I was reporting on startups when that deal
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:04.640]   happened.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.640]   So in the span of a couple of weeks, Instagram went from being a company where I could email
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:12.640]   the CEOs to say, "Hey, how is your user growth going?"
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.640]   And to being a billion dollar company.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.640]   And I don't think anybody was prepared for the whiplash of that.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.640]   And that is basically because Facebook had the power to be like, "Here's a billion dollars.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.640]   We see your future threat and nobody will ever give you this money.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.640]   So why don't you take this acquisition?"
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:30.640]   It was so big, the government had no way to really respond.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:36.640]   And I think now after WhatsApp, after everything, certainly after this Microsoft Activision deal
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:41.640]   too, I do feel like the government is kind of seeing what's happening in the long-term effects
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   of some of these things coming together.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.640]   Maybe there's going to be smarter ways to push back against this stuff.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.640]   I really did.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:54.640]   In fact, looking back on what happened with Instagram and Facebook may have a big impact
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:46:03.640]   on whether Activision and Microsoft come together because it's essentially a huge acquisition
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:09.640]   for Microsoft and it potentially changes Microsoft and changes the entire landscape even though
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.640]   there are plenty of other game companies out there.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:17.640]   Well, you should point out, this is just a request for comment, a request for information.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:23.640]   The FTC and the joint press release from the FTC and the Department of Justice say the
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.640]   comment period is open for 60 days.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.640]   You have until March 21, 2022.
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.640]   But then it isn't even after that.
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.640]   It's not really up to them.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:40.640]   Congress ultimately tells, I think, tells the FTC and the DOJ and the courts, frankly,
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.640]   you can bring a case.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.640]   But the courts are going to look at case law and they're going to look at the laws themselves.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:50.640]   So it isn't really ultimately up to FTC and DOJ.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.640]   They can decide to prosecute, but it may go nowhere.
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:55.640]   So it's interesting.
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.640]   I think these are reasonable things to think about.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.640]   I absolutely do.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:02.640]   I would hope really the place that they should be thinking about is in Congress.
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.640]   Do we need an update to our antitrust laws?
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:13.640]   Now, in the EU, the European Parliament is absolutely moving with alacrity.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:19.640]   The members of the European Parliament today are Thursday voted in favor of the digital
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:22.640]   services act.
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:33.640]   This is a big bill that covers the digital market, has a lot of amendments, but among other things,
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:39.640]   the most, let's see, the past amendments extending the limitation to sensitive personal data
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:48.640]   so that a company or a site can't collect political and religious beliefs, sexual orientation.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:55.640]   Moreover, they decided online platforms should not make denying consent for processing personal
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:57.640]   data more complex than giving it.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:01.640]   It shouldn't be harder to say no than it is to say yes.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.640]   And this is a big one.
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:10.640]   Refusing consent to collect personal data should not be penalized by disabling functions.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.640]   So this, I mean, I haven't read this whole bill.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.640]   It's a big one.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.640]   And there's a lot to it, and this has been much debated.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:23.640]   They got a vote on measures against dark patterns.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:29.640]   Article 13a, dark patterns are techniques designed to distort or impair recipients of
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.640]   services, abilities to make free, autonomous, and informed decisions are choice.
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:40.640]   In other words, to trick you, it forbids the use of specific techniques to extort consent
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.640]   on personal data, for instance, via repeatedly showing pop-ups.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.640]   You sure?
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:46.640]   You sure?
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:47.640]   Really?
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:48.640]   Come on.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.640]   You know, it also prevents platforms from requesting such consent if users already chose
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.640]   via automated means.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:59.640]   In other words, finally, that setting in your Firefox that says, "Do not track.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.640]   Ask companies not to track."
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:05.640]   Maybe they'd have to listen to you, which they don't right now.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:09.640]   There's a lot more anonymity online, all sorts of regulations.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:20.640]   Now, I think the way the EU works is a little confusing to me, but I think this is just
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.640]   advisory.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.640]   I think that each member nation has to decide what to do about it.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.640]   That's my sense of it.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.640]   But the good, and you might say, "Well, what do we care if we're not in the EU?"
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:34.640]   And of course, many of our listeners are, so you would care.
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:38.640]   But even in the US, we should care because companies often are influenced by this.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:41.640]   GDPR has absolutely changed how companies collect data.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:45.640]   This is kind of the next step to GDPR, the Digital Services Act.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:49.640]   So it has been adopted.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:53.640]   Now I think that the other shoe will be to wait and see what the countries do with that.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.640]   That's my sense.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:55.640]   Absolutely.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:00.640]   And GDPR wasn't perfect, but it's only like set the stage for companies to start thinking
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:01.640]   about this stuff more seriously.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.640]   And it'd be get the California Privacy Act, the CCPA.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:05.640]   Right.
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:06.640]   Right.
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:10.640]   And it has given us many more checkboxes to control our cookies.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.640]   To control our cookies.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:12.640]   When we go to, yes.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.640]   I literally now have an extension.
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.640]   Oh, there's an extension for managing it?
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:21.640]   I haven't seen a cookie consent form in a long time.
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:22.640]   Oh, I need that.
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:23.640]   What's the name of it?
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:26.640]   Well, actually, do you use UBlock Origin?
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.640]   No.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:31.640]   There's an ad blocker called UBlock Origin that has a check that has a feature.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.640]   You could say, "No, I don't want to see those anymore."
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:40.440]   And I almost don't even want to admit this, but I also have a Firefox extension that will
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:42.640]   bypass paywalls.
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:44.640]   You pirate.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:49.640]   Because I'm, you know, well, no, the real reason is I pay for a lot of stuff.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:57.000]   But I don't want to, when I'm showing articles here and stuff, sometimes I just want to show
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.120]   the article instead of having a bunch of logins and stuff.
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.480]   So this bypass is a huge number of paywalls.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.120]   I shouldn't tell people about this.
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.120]   You know about it.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.120]   I've heard things go.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:13.120]   I also know that the pockets and instant paper are also really good if you hit one of those.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.760]   But I, to be really clear, I pay for more than a dozen.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:18.000]   I pay for Bloomberg.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.840]   I pay for Wired.
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.520]   But unfortunately, paywalls are so sucky.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.640]   For instance, I pay for Wired.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:26.440]   Good luck getting to a Wired article.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.400]   I log in and I do that and it's ridiculous.
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.400]   Right.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.400]   Right.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:37.320]   And so often, like I pay you, let me vlog in easily or remember me in a smart way and
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:38.320]   they can't do that.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:42.440]   So I just put this thing on and, you know, because, and I'm, by the way, both Wired
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:47.160]   and Bloomberg, even though I've paid for them, I can't still get around these things.
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:49.320]   And I just want to show you the damn article.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:53.640]   Well, one of the best ways to get around them in a lot of cases is just to hit the reader
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.160]   mode on your browser.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.160]   Right.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.800]   That often will get you past it.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.800]   Good tips.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:02.400]   And good tips here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.560]   And here's another tip.
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:13.080]   If you buy an NFT on Twitter, you can have a hexagonal profile picture.
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:14.800]   Oh, sure.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.280]   No, I'm unclear on this.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:24.600]   If you have Twitter blue, you have to link your NFT like yeah, wallet with your wallet.
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:29.760]   And then, and then, but somebody pointed out, this is a great way to just block.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:33.640]   Bitcoin bros, because every time you see an X-agonal, that's right.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:34.640]   Absolutely.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.160]   I would love to block everybody with dot ETH at the end of the year.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.880]   You know, Twitter, we wanted edit button.
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:44.920]   We don't want NFTs for our avatars.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.080]   And there is that button.
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.320]   I think it did implement in the best way Twitter could have, right?
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:51.320]   Edit button.
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:53.000]   Oh, it does is to laser sending.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000]   That's all.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]   That's the only way to do it.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.040]   But it gives you a chance to look at it, make sure you make it has saved my butt.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.040]   That's the regret.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.040]   Absolutely.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.040]   The regrets.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.480]   It's the it's the Gmail unsend button, basically.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.480]   Right.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:08.360]   You don't want people posting things, having them be displayed and then taking stuff back.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:11.600]   That would be a nightmare on an already nightmare service.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:18.280]   I use I use tweet bot for my, both on the Mac and for my phone.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:23.480]   And it just added a feature that actually has been in Twitter, for a while, where you
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:28.880]   when you go to delete a tweet that you've done, one of your options is edit and delete
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.880]   it.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:35.680]   And it takes the text and puts it in a new composition window and then deletes the old
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:36.680]   one.
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:37.680]   And then you can correct it.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:38.680]   So it's for correctness.
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.680]   That's cheating.
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:44.720]   It is cheating, but I will definitely cheat.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:50.400]   I am going to confess that because I was so, you know, perturbed by this, I found a site
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:56.800]   that actually will make a hexagonal Twitter profile picture just for you.
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:57.800]   And then you can use it instead.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.800]   I'm going to do that as a silent protest.
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:00.800]   This is a silent protest.
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:06.120]   So what I did with mine, I made it, I made it six sided as, or say one, two, three, four,
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:07.120]   five.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:08.120]   Is that a hexagon?
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:09.120]   Yeah, I guess that's a hex.
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:10.120]   Hexes five.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:11.120]   Five.
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:12.120]   No, but that's a Pentagon.
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:13.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.120]   And there's an octagon.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.320]   So you can make it stars.
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:17.440]   You can make it any, anything you want.
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:19.240]   And then people will think you're a Bitcoin bro.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:20.760]   So maybe you shouldn't.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.760]   Leo dot ETH.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:27.640]   I made mine a little, little, that's a six sided one.
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:36.960]   So I can't remember this site or I would tell you, I'll have it for you by, by the, by twig.
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:41.640]   What should Spotify do about Joe Rogan?
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.000]   That's, think about that.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.160]   We'll talk about when we come back.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.160]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.240]   We're running a little long in the tooth here.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:51.840]   And I want to tell you about our sponsor, Streak.
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.880]   As a startup founder, as an entrepreneur, you know what it's like running your business
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:55.880]   from your inbox.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:56.880]   You use Gmail.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.600]   You need Streak.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:04.840]   Whether you're tracking sales, fundraising, hiring, support, Streak is a CRM that is in
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:05.840]   Gmail.
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:07.000]   It lives in your inbox.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.840]   Use Streak's free email tools to check if their email, if your emails have been opened,
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.120]   send bulk emails with automated follow up emails to improve your response rates.
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:19.880]   It's all part of your everyday workflow because it's built inside of Gmail.
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:24.040]   You'll see details about your leads, your customers, your investors alongside your email.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:27.320]   You don't have to go back and forth between Gmail and other tools.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:32.840]   Great for prospecting new customers, making fundraising around, growing your team, managing
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:34.040]   support tickets.
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:37.080]   You'll think of all sorts of ways you can use Streak.
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:39.800]   And it's this Streak pipeline, this is the key.
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:43.440]   It lets you track all your processes right inside Gmail.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.840]   Very easy to set up a pipeline.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:48.960]   You can set your first pipeline up in a couple of minutes and then create more, customize
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.640]   each one based on your needs.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.160]   This isn't filters.
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:53.560]   This is so much more sophisticated.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.120]   It's very clever.
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:59.140]   Streak makes it easy to collaborate too by automatically sharing emails and notes with
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:01.400]   anyone on your team.

[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:13.680]   I had never heard about this when they came to us.
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:15.280]   This is fantastic.

[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.200]   Streak.com/Twit.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:53.480]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in Tech.
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:57.960]   Letter went out a coalition of 270 scientists and medical professionals with an open letter
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:05.360]   to Spotify urging them to do something about Joe Rogan.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.120]   Somebody please stop Joe Rogan.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.120]   Stop him.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:09.120]   Stop him.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:10.120]   Stop him.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.120]   Stop him.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:18.680]   Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson also say on New Year's Eve, the program featured Robert
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.840]   Malone, a doctor who calls himself the inventor of mRNA vaccines.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:26.040]   He was banned from Twitter.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:32.040]   You would think the inventor of the mRNA vaccine would not circulate anti-vaccine misinformation.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.880]   YouTube deleted a recording of the podcast shortly after it was uploaded to the website
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:38.000]   by a third party.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.360]   The letter says, quote, "by allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:48.080]   assertions, Spotify is enabling its hosted media to damage public trust and scientific
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:54.960]   research and so doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals."
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:58:00.640]   The signers asked Spotify to immediately establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:01.560]   on its platform.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:06.800]   But is Spotify responsible for what Joe Rogan says?
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:10.960]   They're paying him for it.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:16.280]   If he was on TV or a traditional network, certainly, yeah.
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:18.000]   We see Fox doing this all the time.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.520]   But there's certainly limitations and things you can expect a network to do if somebody
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:23.680]   is just outright lying.
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:25.880]   But again, Fox proves the point otherwise, I guess.
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:28.960]   What about the First Amendment?
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:29.960]   Rogan?
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:32.720]   First Amendment says that the government can't tell you what to do.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:33.720]   Oh, no.
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:34.720]   I know.
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:35.720]   Spotify has the right to do it.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:36.720]   Right.
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:39.640]   I think there would be reasonable for them to say, "Well, he has the right to say whatever
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:41.600]   he wants."
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:51.000]   I think that if he were to lose listeners, viewers, if he would.
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.360]   Oh, if then they do something.
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360]   Yes.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.720]   But I guarantee you this is not losing listeners.
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:57.040]   This is gaining them.
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:58.040]   Yes.
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:58:59.240]   A physician won't do anything.
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:04.240]   But yeah, a financial hit will certainly make Spotify rethink what's happening.
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.000]   That's all these companies will listen to.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.920]   I would love for them to take a moral stand at some point.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:12.000]   But at the end of the day, they have shareholders.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.160]   They have shareholders, right?
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:16.800]   People, they need to pay people who want them to make money.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.240]   It's really hard to take moral stances against that.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:27.440]   Rogan's podcast number one on Spotify globally and in the US last year.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:28.440]   I'm reading Bloomberg.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:31.280]   They say 11 million people listen to the Joe Rogan experience.
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:35.840]   But I think that number comes from Joe Rogan.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:39.160]   Spotify does not say.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:43.640]   Spotify paid him, and again, no one knows, but it's estimated around $100 million to be
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.760]   exclusive on their platform.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:52.120]   They have to be fair, deleted more than 40 episodes of his show to date.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.120]   They've removed 20.
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:54.840]   Spotify has not Spotify.
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:57.320]   Spotify has removed 20,000.
[01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:00.400]   Well, the first thing they do is took all of the stuff down from YouTube because they
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:01.400]   own it now.
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.360]   So that was a different thing.
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:08.480]   Spotify has removed 20,000 podcast episodes for COVID misinformation.
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:15.320]   They do prohibit infringing and illegal content and hate speech.
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:18.200]   But they don't, I guess, misinformation is the problem.
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:23.240]   And partly that's hard because it's hard to identify what's factual and what's not.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.880]   Except when he's out there denying medical science.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:27.880]   Yeah.
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:32.640]   Well, and also there's a clip going around of him, like somebody presenting kind of facts
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:34.480]   about what's happening.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:35.560]   And he rejects it.
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.240]   He screams at him.
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:38.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.240]   Yeah.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:44.440]   Even though they are facts and it's pretty much in that segment, it's pretty much proven.
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.880]   And he just, you know, yeah.
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:47.880]   Yeah.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:51.600]   And the part of the problem, according to the scientists, is he's primarily listened to
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:55.760]   by young men who are very influenced by him.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.840]   I know my son was a big fan.
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:01.600]   He's poisoning like an entire generation of guys right now.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.600]   And I talked to people who really are into him after a certain point.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.480]   Like it's like they live on another planet because of what Joe Rogan told them.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.640]   You know, so there is harm there.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:12.640]   I don't know.
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:16.440]   It would be nice to spotify kind of stepped up and did something about it, but he's making
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:17.440]   them a ton of money.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:20.960]   So of course they won't.
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:24.000]   It's the number one podcast.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.520]   Wish I could say that.
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:28.520]   It's okay.
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:29.520]   Well, have you replaced your Rogan?
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:30.520]   Oh, no.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:31.520]   There you go.
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:32.520]   There you go.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.520]   There you go.
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:34.520]   But that's the thing.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.200]   I'm not going to get 11 million listeners a month.
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:37.200]   That's crazy.
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:39.200]   I mean, that's say, you know, I wish I could.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.840]   You get to be more provocative.
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:41.840]   Yeah.
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:45.840]   And I got to be that's, I mean, honestly, that's the key.
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:46.840]   That's the key.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:55.560]   That's how you generate listeners, you know, be controversial, be provocative.
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:58.000]   The Fed has released a long away.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.040]   What the hell's going on with COVID with COVID with the Bitcoin?
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.040]   I confuse the two.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.040]   Sorry.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.040]   What's going on?
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.040]   Both of you.
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:08.960]   The other thing, the other virus affecting the world.
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:09.960]   Look at the price.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:10.960]   Mm.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:11.960]   That's today.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:25.400]   $429 down today, $5,819 down this week, $14,999 down this month.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.400]   What the?
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:30.280]   You know, if I feel sorry for El Salvador, is there national currency?
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:31.280]   That's right.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:33.080]   Talk about inflation.
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:39.080]   In 2017, when the, when Bitcoin was like at its peak, and I did this story, I think I've
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:44.600]   talked about this before, I did a story on Ethereum miners buying graphics cards.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:50.280]   And I went into this woman's house in North Houston, and she had turned her living room
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:55.000]   into a room full of Ethereum mining cages.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.880]   And she had to beef up her air conditioning system in her house.
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.680]   Well, that's the thing.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:06.320]   It's designed to cost you more as time goes by to mine.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:11.160]   And she, and, and I, the, so I thought, well, I'm going to try, I want to, I need to learn
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:12.160]   about this.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:16.400]   So I spent $20 on Bitcoin in back then.
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:20.520]   And it peaked at one point at $122, my $20.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:25.400]   And I thought, oh, I should cash out, but no, I'm going to hold it.
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:28.000]   And you are my friend, a diamond hands.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:34.560]   It's rocket laser eyes, laser eyes.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:41.320]   But, but it's now down to when I last looked, it was down to like 70 bucks, like 20.
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:42.320]   Yeah.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:46.440]   So it's, it's, you know, what is my skeptic?
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:51.960]   Nice. I've lost half the value of my wall unlockable wallet.
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.560]   Doesn't matter.
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:57.720]   The fed, the reason I bring this up, the fed has released a long awaited study on the digital
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:03.840]   dollar, but refuses to take a position.
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.560]   So thanks for nothing.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:11.720]   The central bank's 40 page doctorate document explores according to the CNBC.
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.560]   The plethora, who haven't seen that word in a while, of issues and notes that the public
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:21.680]   comment, the public comment will be solicited.
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:23.080]   A digital currency.
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:26.840]   I mean, we're almost digital as it is these days, right?
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:29.120]   But the dollar is digital for the most part.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.120]   No.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:32.520]   I mean, I can't remember the last time I used cash for anything.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:33.680]   Yeah.
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:38.360]   One primary difference between the fed's dollar and other digital transactions, current digital
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:42.520]   money is a liability of the bank, you know, your credit card.
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:47.800]   A digital dollar from the fed would be a fed liability.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:52.400]   Among other things, that means the fed wouldn't pay interest on money stored with it.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.920]   It is riskless.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:58.480]   So you guess you get to choose.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.480]   I don't know.
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:06.680]   I don't know if this, how this relates to stablecoin, which is another kind of currency,
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:10.880]   you know, kind of a cryptocurrency that a lot of national banks are looking at.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:13.360]   I'm not sure how this relates.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:17.520]   Advocates of the digital dollar worry that the fed's delay in implementing a central bank
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:24.200]   currency will put it behind China, which is already doing a digital currency.
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:26.560]   There have been suggestions.
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:28.160]   Suggestions have been made.
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:32.480]   The China's lead in the space ultimately could threaten U.S. dollars hegemony as the
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.280]   world's reserve currency.
[02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:37.440]   Fed says, and we're not that worried about that.
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:40.560]   We got to get this right.
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:46.000]   And at the very bottom of the piece, it says, and we can't do anything unless Congress allows
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.000]   it anyway.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.840]   So, we'll get up.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:52.760]   Certainly we'll pay payoff for us to just take our time right.
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:57.080]   We don't want to be a point where somebody's like, I lost the password for the Federal Reserve.
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:05:58.280]   Oh my God.
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:00.920]   What do we do now?
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.560]   I got millions in there.
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:04.560]   Trillions.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:05.560]   Trillions.
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:06.560]   Cat.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:14.360]   Faster cable internet speeds are coming, says Dwight.
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:15.600]   Even though you don't really need him.
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:16.600]   What do you mean?
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:17.600]   What do you mean?
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:19.640]   So, this is a story idea.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.640]   If you remember last week I mentioned that my car.
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:24.400]   What the hell is that?
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:26.440]   Are you wearing a cat hat?
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:28.080]   All right.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.240]   My cat has arrived.
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.240]   He's an orange, an orange tab.
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.240]   He is an orange tab.
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:34.240]   This is Milo.
[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:35.240]   Oh, hi, mom.
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:36.240]   Yes.
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:38.000]   So, anyway, there he goes.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000]   What a leap.
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:44.800]   So, anyway, last week I wrote about 5G, and I thought I'd write about Home Broadband this
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:45.800]   week.
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:54.520]   And Comcast had said it had completed this test of the next generation of cable modem,
[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:59.800]   which is known as DOCSIS 4, or to the marketing guys at cable labs.
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:04.080]   It's called 10G.
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:10.400]   And it's called 10G because they think it can get up to 10 gigabits eventually.
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:11.400]   And so 5G.
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:12.400]   Yeah.
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:13.400]   Yes, double 5G.
[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:15.200]   It has 5G as fifth generation.
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:16.920]   This is 10 gigabytes.
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:22.160]   So, anyway, so this is coming at the end of this year and early next.
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:29.760]   And Comcast and, you know, Warner and all of the other cable companies are going to be
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:31.360]   moving to this.
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:36.960]   And it will take your speeds up to, if you know, you wanted to pay for it, 10 gigabits.
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:41.720]   And I talked to an analyst about this.
[02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:48.880]   And what's interesting is that right now, you know, you barely need, you know, gigabit
[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:53.160]   speed or, you know, what a lot of people have with Comcast.
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:55.240]   This would take it even beyond that.
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:08:01.840]   But as we were talking, you know, about Activision and Microsoft and what's coming in the future,
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:04.480]   gaming in the metaverse, streaming games.
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:09.400]   At some point, if you have multiple people doing this in your house, you may actually
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:11.960]   start to need more than a gigabit.
[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:17.000]   And so it's kind of, it's kind of, you know, the cable companies attempt to kind of get
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.080]   ahead of fiber providers like AT&T.
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:24.600]   And it's coming faster than you think.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:25.600]   Interesting.
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:26.760]   And likely next year.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:30.200]   So this is kind of like that 5G conversation we had earlier.
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:31.200]   Yes.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:32.200]   Yes.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:33.200]   But it's wired.
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:34.200]   Yeah.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:36.680]   I have gigabit right now through my cable company.
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:37.680]   It's not cement.
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.080]   And how much do you actually get?
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:41.080]   Close to a gigabit.
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:42.080]   Very close.
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:43.080]   Like 900 something.
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:44.080]   Why?
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:45.880]   Is that not?
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:49.720]   A lot of people don't like I have Comcast gigabit.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:55.120]   And because of, I have a gigabit router, what I thought was a gigabit router, and it really
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:58.920]   can max out only at about 800.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:05.720]   And then my phone can only get out of that, gets about 500 or 600.
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:12.160]   And so, but I don't, you know, I'd be, I could probably get by with what I do with 300 megabits.
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.360]   Well, that's, it's really more how many people are using it at the same time.
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:17.360]   Right.
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:25.280]   If you have a household with multiple kids, they're all streaming games or they're watching
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:28.400]   4K video at the same time.
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:30.320]   Yeah, you probably would need it.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:34.880]   And of course, you'll also need Comcast raise its bandwidth cap.
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:38.880]   I pay for no bandwidth cap.
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:41.760]   That's the big, and by the way, that is not.
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:42.760]   That should be outlawed.
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:43.760]   Like talk about regulations.
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:47.320]   Like, yeah, my parents also had to move over to business account because of that.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.320]   Yeah.
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:51.200]   And what's the point of making speeds faster if you're.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:59.280]   Wasn't there some discussion in the pre-Trump FCC about data caps?
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:03.080]   Wasn't there some discussion about, discussion about banning them?
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:09.080]   Well, there was a lot of court action about unlimited bandwidth.
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:10.080]   Yes, right.
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:13.440]   But not being unlimited, obviously.
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:14.440]   Right.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.440]   Right.
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:19.200]   This specific technology sounds good because I do remember being in New York and relying
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:23.640]   on cable and like you could tell what everybody was online at home at time, right?
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:24.640]   Right.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:25.920]   And then your neighborhood speeds start chugging.
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:30.880]   So having better speeds overall, like, you know, expanding that pipe a little, I think,
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:32.960]   is a good thing overall.
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:36.160]   But I'm sure people are not getting the speeds they're actually paying for.
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:40.840]   Like I get, I'm subscribed to 18T gigabit down here near Atlanta.
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:45.640]   And I only really get gigabit if I'm wired directly into the router or like standing
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:46.920]   right near the router.
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:51.720]   And then I just started testing their new Wi-Fi 6 gateway.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:53.320]   And that made things a lot better.
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:57.840]   But they're also doing things like I have a, what do you call it, an extender down here
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:10:59.640]   and a mesh extender.
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:04.200]   And now 18T is going to force people to pay $8 a month forever for these things.
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:09.520]   Whereas last gen before, I used to be able to just buy one for like 50 bucks and you
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:10.520]   own it.
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:18.200]   Well, the good news with, at least with Comcast, when I was talking to their senior vice president
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:24.440]   of network operations, he said to me directly when I asked that they will continue to allow
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:30.320]   you to have your own modem and your own router when they go to Docs is for.
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:32.240]   So you'll be able to buy a third party.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.240]   Yes.
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:34.240]   Yeah.
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:35.240]   So that's, I was very happy.
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:36.240]   Because you can't really do that fiber fiber.
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:38.360]   That's the, you got to use whatever the company gives you basically.
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.360]   Yeah.
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:43.480]   So fiber's pretty much stopped, right?
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:48.440]   Nobody's rolling out new fiber or I see new fiber from down here from 18T.
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:52.880]   But I don't know if it's like part of an existing schedule or plan or Google stops for
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.880]   rising stops.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.440]   I guess there, I mean, we have a local provider around here called Sonic, which we actually
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:11:59.920]   use that we love.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:04.000]   And they have slowly been rolling that they actually have to dig trenches and stuff.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.000]   Right.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.000]   Right.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.800]   And nobody's really investing in infrastructure at this point.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:18.040]   I don't think about Docs is for it is that it does use the existing cable infrastructure.
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:21.760]   So the co-acts with the same hard.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:22.760]   Right.
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:28.960]   And the other thing is, is that cable companies have been, they use fiber up to nodes in your
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:32.400]   neighborhood and they've been pulling that fiber closer and closer.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.960]   And that's one of the reasons why they're able to do it, but they don't have to retrench.
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:38.760]   You don't have to do fiber to the curb, but you would like to get.
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:39.760]   Right.
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:40.760]   Yeah.
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:41.760]   Okay.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:42.760]   You get as close as you can.
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:45.880]   Do you think any, I mean, you think we'll actually get 10 gigabits ever?
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:50.200]   I mean, I think if you wanted to pay for it, you might get it.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:54.440]   But you know, I'll take, I'll take the four that Comcast tested the other day.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:59.360]   We have fiber 10 symmetric here from, is that from Sonic?
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.360]   That is from Sonic.
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:01.360]   Yeah.
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:02.600]   Is it, is it 10 gigabit fiber?
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:03.600]   Yeah.
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:04.600]   Symmetric.
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:05.600]   Nice.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:06.600]   That's the reason we moved here.
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:07.600]   Oh, man.
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:09.900]   I'll be honest with you.
[02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:13.760]   I do want to throw a PSA out there for AT&T gigabit users.
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:18.600]   Apparently this new gateway has fiber right to the gateway, which is kind of nice.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:19.600]   Oh, interesting.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:21.880]   There's like a little box like your house, right?
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:25.480]   And that normally connects to fiber and it goes ethernet to the old gateway.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:27.240]   Now it's like fiber right to the box.
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:29.580]   So I think that would be a great stew.
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:35.540]   So if you're a customer of AT&T and you get that, that new modem, they have to make
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:37.860]   a change in your house, right?
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:39.860]   They have to come in and bring that fiber in.
[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:44.500]   I think they, so there's a box like at some point, you know, yeah, there is a hole drilled
[02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:45.820]   through the side of your house, right?
[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:51.000]   To pull that fiber in, but the box that like sits by an outlet in your house, they just
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.780]   have to swap that out and then they can pull another fiber line right to the, to the gateway.
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:02.620]   Of course, if you're on Wi-Fi, nobody's getting speeds anywhere near that.
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:04.420]   My Wi-Fi is faster.
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:07.020]   That is the world we're living in right now.
[02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:12.140]   Like right now I'm in an office in my basement and I use, I don't have full ethernet pull
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:13.140]   down here.
[02:14:13.140 --> 02:14:15.860]   So I've been using power line ethernet to get like really nice stable.
[02:14:15.860 --> 02:14:16.860]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:19.260]   For podcasts and that's working well for me.
[02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:24.060]   It should be gigabit, but the only speeds I'm ever seeing are like 200 to 300, like
[02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:25.060]   at most.
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:28.740]   So not really that much, but I have a Wi-Fi extender down here and this sucker is getting
[02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:30.980]   me like 700 to 800 regularly.
[02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:34.220]   That's more common than being on Wi-Fi.
[02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:38.500]   More line networking than it is on the Wi-Fi.
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:41.860]   There is, here comes Wi-Fi 7.
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:43.500]   Oh boy.
[02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:45.780]   What you need with your 10G?
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:47.260]   Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:51.140]   If you're going to have that fast bandwidth, you better get better Wi-Fi.
[02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:58.680]   Wi-Fi 7 products should become available according to report from digital trends next year in
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:03.380]   anticipation of the launch of Wi-Fi 7 around 2024.
[02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:10.260]   So you could buy the hardware, but you won't be able to do it anything with it till 2024.
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:15.420]   Taiwan-based semiconductor firm MediaTech conducted the first ever tests showing super
[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:21.800]   fast speeds and low latency transmission of its Wi-Fi 7, phyologic technology to key
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:28.860]   customers and industry collaborators 2.4 times more speed than Wi-Fi 6, even with the
[02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:31.060]   same number of antennas.
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:33.540]   30 gigabits.
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:34.540]   What going on?
[02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:36.860]   We have to 40 gigabits.
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:39.980]   I mean, there's also Wi-Fi 6E that is kind of rolling out now too.
[02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:40.900]   So it's- Yes, that's been a-
[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:41.900]   Green light.
[02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:43.460]   Yeah, that's been green light.
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:47.980]   Yeah, that's on the 6 megahertz, 6 gigahertz spectrum.
[02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:49.700]   And they're really expensive.
[02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:50.700]   Yeah.
[02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:53.260]   And many of your devices don't support it yet anyway.
[02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:56.140]   So all right, let's take a little break.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:16:02.740]   Let's break and then we will wrap things up with our fabulous panel, Dwight Silverman.
[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:05.340]   I don't know what to say of what?
[02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:06.740]   Of Dwight Silverman.
[02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:07.740]   Of Dwight Silverman.
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:11.620]   I also have his- I also have Dwight Silverman.com.
[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:13.020]   So you can- Okay.
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:14.020]   There you go.
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:15.020]   And then into.
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:16.020]   Dwhitesilverman.com at DC.
[02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:17.020]   I'm at DC.
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:20.380]   I'm like Trent Krem, the independent.
[02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:21.380]   Independent.
[02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:22.380]   Independent.
[02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:23.380]   Yeah.
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.380]   Nice.
[02:16:24.380 --> 02:16:30.420]   Also with his Devendra Hardewar of Engadget fame.
[02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:31.420]   Our show today brought to you- Hello.
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:32.420]   Hello.
[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:37.060]   Brought to you by Zip Recruiter, our sponsor.
[02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:44.940]   It's actually, you know, I feel like we're on the cusp of a big year.
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:52.220]   And of course, there are industries now in 2022 that are already hiring to ramp up.
[02:16:52.220 --> 02:16:56.380]   Because I just- I have to think the end is nigh.
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:16:58.740]   And I mean that in a good way.
[02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:06.380]   Sustainability, businesses, eco-friendly products and services, big pet services, all those
[02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:10.660]   pets that we got during COVID have to be walked and fed and trained.
[02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:15.260]   Fitness services, not just regular fitness like gyms, but non-traditional workout studios,
[02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:18.620]   kickboxing, wellness apps.
[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:19.620]   It's going to be a big year.
[02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:25.100]   And if you're hiring for your big business, I want you to talk to Zip Recruiter.
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:28.380]   It's what we use for hiring and it is awesome.
[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:30.340]   Digital events and conferences.
[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:31.580]   Yep.
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:32.580]   Home improvement.
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:34.700]   A lot of people are renovating, redecorating.
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:37.620]   If you're going to be at home, more minds will fix it up.
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:42.620]   If you work for our own business in a growing industry and you're hiring, you've got to
[02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:43.620]   go to Zip Recruiter.
[02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:44.620]   Zip Recruiter.
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:48.660]   You can try it for free right now at ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:51.020]   What does Zip Recruiter do that makes it so special?
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:55.900]   Well, first of all, one posting on Zip Recruiter goes to more than a hundred other job boards.
[02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:58.500]   You're casting the widest net social media too.
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:02.180]   The more people are going to see you're posting and that's good because the more people see
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:05.020]   it, the more likely the right person will see it and apply for that job.
[02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:10.540]   But here's another secret, super secret sauce that Zip Recruiter has.
[02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:16.500]   They'll actually look at your job posting, analyze their resumes and find people who
[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:21.140]   are right for your job and then send you their names so you can invite them to apply.
[02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:25.420]   And I have to tell you, when you invite somebody to apply, they show up.
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:26.900]   They show up for the interview.
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:27.900]   They're ready.
[02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:31.940]   They want to work for you because they're flattered, frankly, that you said, "Hey, you
[02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:32.940]   look good.
[02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:35.820]   Would you like to apply for this job?"
[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:39.900]   No wonder Zip Recruiter is the number one rated hiring site according to G2 ratings, number
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:41.140]   one in the U.S.

[02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:03.740]   I know you're going to love it.
[02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:07.780]   We had a fun week this week on the shows.
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:11.540]   In fact, such a good time that we've made this mini movie for you to enjoy.
[02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:12.540]   Watch.
[02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:13.540]   Oh, yeah.
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:14.540]   Oh, yeah.
[02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:42.380]   Previously on Twit, Tech News Weekly, Activision Blizzard was acquired by Microsoft.
[02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:47.620]   This news kind of came through and suddenly everybody was just, "Ah, lots and lots of
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:48.620]   lots to talk about."
[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:49.620]   It's pretty accurate.
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:53.100]   So when the news broke that Microsoft was going to acquire this company, it immediately
[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:57.220]   raises all of these enormous questions about what happens to a company in turmoil.
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:02.420]   It has cultural issues that might be fixable and might not be, honestly.
[02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:03.420]   Windows Weekly.
[02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:04.420]   There will be regulatory...
[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:06.220]   Well, that's the next question.
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:07.220]   Can this even go through it?
[02:20:07.220 --> 02:20:08.780]   I don't think it's going to be stopped.
[02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:09.780]   You don't?
[02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:10.780]   I don't think it's going to be stopped either.
[02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:14.100]   The single sentence in the Microsoft announcement that I think tells the tale.
[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:20.100]   When this acquisition goes through, we will be the third largest gaming company by revenue.
[02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:21.100]   They're not creating the biggest.
[02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:23.180]   They're not leaf-frogging everybody.
[02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:24.180]   All about Android.
[02:20:24.180 --> 02:20:28.900]   I'm even more excited to welcome our guest this week, my friend, your friend, none other
[02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:30.460]   than Mr. Patrick Norton.
[02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:34.460]   Patrick has earned the right of for our video watchers of a lower third that says "The
[02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:38.580]   Patrick Norton" because there is the one, the only, "The Patrick Norton."
[02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:40.580]   I just thought Burke was mocking me.
[02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:42.820]   We go backwards tonight.
[02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:44.300]   Twit.tv.
[02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:45.300]   Tell your friends.
[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:47.500]   What are you going to tell them?
[02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:51.060]   That's the question.
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:53.020]   Thanks, too, to our club, Twit members.
[02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:57.580]   We had a great number of great club, Twit events, Stacey's Book Club.
[02:20:57.580 --> 02:20:59.260]   They asked me anything with Andy Inako.
[02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:03.820]   We've got some great events coming up, including an event with Mike and Amira Elgin talking
[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:06.940]   about Gastro Nomad.
[02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:08.940]   Who else?
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:09.940]   Georgia Dow.
[02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:10.940]   That's right.
[02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:11.940]   Is that this week?
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:12.940]   That's exciting.
[02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:13.940]   Friday.
[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:14.940]   It was Friday, and aren't we missed it?
[02:21:14.940 --> 02:21:15.940]   Oh, man.
[02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:17.940]   Well, anyway, that's okay if you're a member of Club Twit.
[02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:19.540]   We put it up on the Twit Plus feed.
[02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:21.220]   You can hear it after the fact.
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:26.060]   There are, thanks to Ant-Proit, our community manager, there's a lot of stuff happening in
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:27.060]   the club.
[02:21:27.060 --> 02:21:28.060]   Here's the benefit.
[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:29.580]   $7 a month.
[02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:31.740]   Ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:38.620]   This is the fabulous Club Twit Discord, which is full of good cheer, and lots of conversations,
[02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:43.100]   not just behind the scenes at the shows, but on all sorts of topics, books and coding
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:45.100]   and all sorts of stuff.
[02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:49.740]   And you get the Club Twit Plus feed, which is a unique feed, filled with things that don't
[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:54.340]   make it to the shows, including stuff before and after shows, the untitled Linux show,
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:57.700]   Stacey's Book Club, the Gizfiz, $7 a month.
[02:21:57.700 --> 02:22:00.220]   Seems we should charge more, but we're not going to.
[02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:05.100]   All you have to go do is go to twit.tv/clubtwit and join the club.
[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:13.260]   We thank you all you Club Twit members for supporting everything we do here at this week
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:14.260]   in tech.
[02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:18.100]   A couple of short stories to wrap it up.
[02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:25.780]   A big deal when Twitter hired Mudge to run its security team, Peter Zotko.
[02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:26.780]   He's gone now.
[02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:29.060]   I don't think he was there more than two years.
[02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:30.060]   Zotko was famous.
[02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:36.420]   He'd worked in government, but he also was one of the founders of the Cult of the Dead
[02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:39.420]   Cow hacking group.
[02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:46.100]   Twitter recruited him after teenagers compromised the company systems in July of 2020.
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:47.100]   I don't know.
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:48.100]   Somebody help us with these teens.
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:49.100]   Help us with these teens.
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:50.100]   Mudge.
[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:51.100]   I don't know what happened.
[02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:52.100]   Mudge is gone.
[02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:53.100]   That's it.
[02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:54.100]   It's a Mudge Nudge.
[02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:55.100]   It's a Mudge Nudge.
[02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:59.020]   He was nudged out after the new CEO came in.
[02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:03.460]   Also, Rinkie Sette, the chief information security officer.
[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:04.940]   I think security has been good at Twitter.
[02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:06.460]   I don't know what's going on.
[02:23:06.460 --> 02:23:08.060]   I don't know what's going on.
[02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:09.300]   It's personalities.
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:11.060]   It's relationships.
[02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:12.060]   Yeah.
[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:13.060]   Probably.
[02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:14.060]   He's a CEO lining up his people.
[02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:16.060]   I grew up as people I was.
[02:23:16.060 --> 02:23:17.060]   Yeah.
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:18.060]   Right.
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:19.060]   Yeah.
[02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:23.740]   TikTok's marketing chief ousted after going rogue with bizarre campaigns.
[02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:25.740]   This is a great story.
[02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:30.340]   You know, one of the things he was going to do was he was going to have this restaurant
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:32.340]   based on recipes from TikTok.
[02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:33.340]   Yeah.
[02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:37.340]   And when I saw that story, when it first broke, I was like, what?
[02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:40.620]   Because like the recipes on TikTok looked just got awful.
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:42.460]   Hey, wait a minute.
[02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:44.540]   You haven't seen my son's account.
[02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:45.540]   Hold on.
[02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:46.540]   Hold on.
[02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:47.540]   Oh, great.
[02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:49.020]   My son is one of the.
[02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:50.020]   No, no, it's okay.
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:51.020]   I don't care.
[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:55.700]   My son is one of the one of the people, Nick Tran, who is the former marketing guy.
[02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:58.940]   Was talking about, there's a lot of cooking stuff on TikTok.
[02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:02.300]   I think you would enjoy my son's cooking videos.
[02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:06.220]   However, I think they're, they're, they're quite good.
[02:24:06.220 --> 02:24:10.940]   And that's not what I would call clean food.
[02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:12.060]   Oh, it's not healthy.
[02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:13.700]   Did I say it would be healthy?
[02:24:13.700 --> 02:24:15.100]   No, it's not healthy.
[02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:17.540]   He's got 1.8 million followers though.
[02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:18.540]   Let's see.
[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:20.580]   What's a, yeah, here's one that was seven million views.
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:22.340]   He pesto chicken sandwich.
[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:24.060]   Always a mmm.
[02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:25.260]   It's sloppy.
[02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:26.260]   It's wet.
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:27.260]   It's messy.
[02:24:27.260 --> 02:24:29.740]   And he made that knife stick right in the cutting board.
[02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:31.300]   You got, you got to stick the knife.
[02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:32.300]   Okay.
[02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:33.300]   If you're a TikTok.
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:34.300]   I always, I see stuff like that.
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:37.500]   I go, how many takes did that take off to ask him?
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:38.780]   I'll have to ask him.
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:43.340]   Anyway, he's, he cooked a whole chicken for just one chicken sandwich.
[02:24:43.340 --> 02:24:44.340]   How about that?
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:45.340]   Right?
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:46.540]   That's what I call commitment.
[02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:50.940]   Anyway, Nick Tran, back to the, I thank you for the chance to plug that.
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:52.940]   I'm really, I'll stop this.
[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:57.660]   TikTok kitchen was going to be, feature foods made popular in TikTok, including by the
[02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:01.740]   way, the number one TikTok food, which is some sort of weird pasta with feta cheese
[02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:02.740]   that you stir up.
[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:04.220]   Oh my God.
[02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:05.220]   Gross.
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:06.220]   Right.
[02:25:06.220 --> 02:25:07.220]   Right.
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:08.220]   I hear it was good.
[02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:09.220]   Right.
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:10.220]   I'm sure it was delicious.
[02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:11.220]   Actual people say it's good.
[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:12.220]   Yeah.
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:13.300]   But it didn't look delicious.
[02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:15.260]   Other half baked get it.
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:17.220]   Product ideas.
[02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:24.020]   Computer led NFT collection featuring celebrities like Lil Nas X and Bella Porch.
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:26.940]   He promised he didn't, he forgot to ask management.
[02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:30.300]   He's, he's just too much of an innovator.
[02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:31.820]   You know, too much of an innovator.
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:32.820]   Right.
[02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:34.220]   But we covered all of these things.
[02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:35.220]   TikTok resumes.
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:36.220]   Yeah.
[02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:40.540]   You would post your resume on TikTok and help people get it, it helped people get entry-level
[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:44.180]   jobs at Target Chipotle.
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:51.460]   A TikTok senior executive called these campaigns out of line with the company's goals.
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:54.180]   Too many side shows they said he was getting.
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:26:00.460]   Remember TikTok is owned by what was probably a fairly conservative Chinese company.
[02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:02.020]   And you know, he was too good.
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:03.420]   He'll find a job.
[02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:08.100]   It is weird how TikTok owned by ByteDance is a company that is basically like, took what
[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:12.660]   Vine was doing, kind of let people run with it and do a lot of different stuff with it.
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:18.820]   So that sense of freedom versus traditional Chinese company does, it is a little weird
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:19.820]   sometimes.
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:21.740]   You know, what TikTok is turning into culturally.
[02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:22.740]   Yeah.
[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:23.740]   Yeah.
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:29.740]   By the way, salthank.com get that Calabrian pesto flaky sea salt.
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:32.340]   I'm shameless.
[02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:34.780]   I know.
[02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:35.780]   If you're going to be a.
[02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:38.500]   We need to regulate all this too much in marketing.
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:39.500]   That's right.
[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:42.500]   Hashtag sponsor, hashtag ad.
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:49.060]   If you're going to the Olympics start in a couple of weeks, February 13th, the athletes
[02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:50.660]   are being told, don't bring your phone.
[02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:56.700]   Bring a burner because you have to, first of all, you have to have to install an app.
[02:26:56.700 --> 02:26:57.700]   Yeah.
[02:26:57.700 --> 02:27:03.380]   A Beijing Olympics app, which apparently kind of tracks everything you're up to.
[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:09.300]   So you're not going to want to bring that home.
[02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:12.740]   Putting your own phone, I guess, is the bottom line.
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:18.380]   China has an app that is required to even get around the Olympic Village, but there's
[02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:20.700]   some question about exactly how much it'll do.
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:24.820]   I'm sure it's mostly for like COVID prevention, Seth, too, is what I'm wondering.
[02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:29.340]   Like they're trying to be zero COVID and I'm sure it's like China wants to be really
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:31.380]   careful with all these new people coming in.
[02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:33.860]   But yeah, a little scary.
[02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:35.220]   I'm going to ask Mr.
[02:27:35.220 --> 02:27:39.780]   Filmcast Netflix, kind of in trouble.
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:45.420]   The stock market anyway didn't like it when they reported a net game of, this sounds good,
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:46.420]   right?
[02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:54.140]   8.28 million subscribers in Q4 driven by markets outside North America, 221 million total subscribers,
[02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:57.500]   but it was below estimates.
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:03.020]   Shares fell more than 20%.
[02:28:03.020 --> 02:28:07.900]   Wall Street analysts have been projecting a gain of 7.25 million subscribers for the
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:09.500]   first quarter of 2022.
[02:28:09.500 --> 02:28:14.580]   The company forecast a third of that.
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:20.940]   Also investors likely spooked by the fact that Netflix admitted in its quarterly newsletter
[02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:25.140]   to shareholders that stepped up competition in the streaming wars may be affecting our
[02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:27.420]   marginal growth sum.
[02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:28.420]   That's the quote.
[02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:35.020]   Maybe maybe our marginal growth sum a little bit.
[02:28:35.020 --> 02:28:36.580]   Just a little bit.
[02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:41.340]   They spend a lot of money on content.
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:45.540]   And of course it works for them or has worked in the past.
[02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:51.260]   But you know, if it doesn't, then you've then you've spent a lot of money for sure.
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:55.820]   They make so much stuff and now they're not the only game in town, right?
[02:28:55.820 --> 02:29:00.900]   It used to be pretty much just Netflix, maybe Hulu, like Hulu was in there and Amazon was
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:04.380]   throwing a lot of money at like prestige movies and shows.
[02:29:04.380 --> 02:29:10.140]   And now with HBO Max and Disney and Paramount Plus and everything, all this stuff happening
[02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:16.260]   all at once, I'm sure like I have to pick and choose what I'm subscribing to sometimes.
[02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:20.140]   You know, I'm subscribing to Showtime for a couple of weeks to watch yellow jackets,
[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:22.260]   you know, and I hear that's quite good.
[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:23.260]   Yeah, it's really good.
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:24.260]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:25.260]   Yeah.
[02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:28.140]   It's been a bunch of what cheerleaders who it's kind of.
[02:29:28.140 --> 02:29:29.140]   That's a soccer team.
[02:29:29.140 --> 02:29:30.140]   Soccer team.
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:31.140]   Very much alive.
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:32.140]   Yeah.
[02:29:32.140 --> 02:29:33.940]   More of the flies meets soccer team.
[02:29:33.940 --> 02:29:34.940]   Leads floss.
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:35.940]   It's Ted Lasso.
[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:36.940]   Meets lost.
[02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:37.940]   Meets lost.
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:38.940]   Not so much Ted Lasso.
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:42.980]   Yeah, with the girls high school soccer team and you see them in high school time in the
[02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:46.060]   90s, you get like lots of great 90s, soundtracks, stuff.
[02:29:46.060 --> 02:29:47.060]   That's fine.
[02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:50.260]   And then modern day today with great actors like Christine Areche.
[02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:51.260]   Okay.
[02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:52.260]   Yeah.
[02:29:52.260 --> 02:29:53.260]   Love it.
[02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:54.260]   All right, I'm going to watch that.
[02:29:54.260 --> 02:29:55.260]   Yeah.
[02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:56.260]   So much to watch.
[02:29:56.260 --> 02:29:57.260]   Billions is back.
[02:29:57.260 --> 02:29:58.260]   Yeah.
[02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:01.420]   I have finally catching up on the Witcher.
[02:30:01.420 --> 02:30:02.420]   That's hot stuff.
[02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:03.420]   It's all right.
[02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:04.420]   Don't forget Ozark.
[02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:06.260]   Don't forget Ozark is back.
[02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:07.260]   Ozark.
[02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:10.540]   You know, Netflix is kind of like the baseline for me.
[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:18.780]   I would not to me, I was on the 1799 now, 1999 plan for 4K.
[02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:21.380]   And it's like I would not drop Netflix.
[02:30:21.380 --> 02:30:22.380]   I love it.
[02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:23.380]   There's so much there.
[02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:24.380]   I love it.
[02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:29.540]   You know, you can't find, you know, yeah, you've got Disney and HBO Max and so forth.
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:31.940]   But where else you got to find something like Midnight Diner.
[02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:32.940]   Yeah.
[02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:33.940]   For God's sake.
[02:30:33.940 --> 02:30:34.940]   There's obscurity.
[02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:35.940]   Yeah.
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:36.940]   Diner is just wonderful.
[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:37.940]   Yeah, you search around.
[02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:38.940]   That's the real problem is discoverability.
[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:41.940]   But thank God we've got Devindra on the show because he's the kind of listen to his podcast.
[02:30:41.940 --> 02:30:43.940]   I'm going to subscribe to that.
[02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:44.940]   Yeah.
[02:30:44.940 --> 02:30:45.940]   Yeah.
[02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:46.940]   Yeah.
[02:30:46.940 --> 02:30:47.940]   Yeah.
[02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:48.940]   Yeah.
[02:30:48.940 --> 02:30:49.940]   Have you guys seen Midnight Mass because that is like the way Netflix thing that everything
[02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:51.420]   makes planning good does just worth a watch.
[02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:52.940]   What's what's I don't think I've seen that.
[02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:53.940]   What's that about?
[02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:55.580]   It's the recent horror show.
[02:30:55.580 --> 02:31:00.540]   It's a very like Stephen King style about a small like Island town off the coast of England.
[02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:03.020]   So you actually appreciate the accents and stuff there Leo.
[02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:04.020]   What?
[02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:05.020]   It's very much like.
[02:31:05.020 --> 02:31:08.820]   It's good Will hunting meets the house of Haunted Hill.
[02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:09.820]   We're kind of.
[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:12.660]   It's happening on the island.
[02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:15.820]   You don't want to give them too many spoilers.
[02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:20.020]   But it is it's also a slow burn and it's really good.
[02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:21.740]   Oh, I want to watch this.
[02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:22.740]   It's really good.
[02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:24.660]   It's creepy the hell out.
[02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:25.660]   Yeah.
[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:26.660]   It's really good.
[02:31:26.660 --> 02:31:29.260]   Everything Mike Plankton does and he's done several shows on Netflix at this point.
[02:31:29.260 --> 02:31:32.220]   So you have Haunted Hill House and Blime Manor.
[02:31:32.220 --> 02:31:37.140]   But yeah, there there's only they could only grow like a rocket ship for so long, right?
[02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:40.180]   And even now they're still growing just not as much as Wall Street.
[02:31:40.180 --> 02:31:45.260]   It's so typical of Wall Street expecting that kind of, you know, 100% growth quarter
[02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:46.260]   over quarter.
[02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:48.260]   Why do what do you mean you can't keep doubling.
[02:31:48.260 --> 02:31:49.260]   You just can't do that.
[02:31:49.260 --> 02:31:50.260]   You just can't do it.
[02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:51.260]   Yeah.
[02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:52.860]   So there may be a plateau coming.
[02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:53.860]   Who knows?
[02:31:53.860 --> 02:31:54.860]   Yeah.
[02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:59.980]   Felony charges the first fatal crash involving Tesla's autopilot.
[02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:05.420]   The driver apparently didn't know that the autopilot does not stop at stoplights, red lights.
[02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:12.420]   This is right through the red light and caused a fatality crash.
[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:14.180]   The driver pled not guilty.
[02:32:14.180 --> 02:32:16.060]   He's free on bail while the case is pending.
[02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:20.140]   But he killed two people in 2019 allegedly.
[02:32:20.140 --> 02:32:21.140]   Yeah.
[02:32:21.140 --> 02:32:24.140]   Or did autopilot do it?
[02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:25.420]   I don't know.
[02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:27.300]   The feature is called autopilot.
[02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:28.300]   Yeah.
[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:30.220]   You know, what does that mean?
[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:36.220]   There is, I respect a lot of what Elon Musk has done with Tesla with SpaceX and then some
[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:39.140]   things are just like you were just pushing things.
[02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:40.140]   Yeah.
[02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:41.140]   Yeah.
[02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:42.140]   Don't call it autopilot.
[02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:44.340]   Don't don't set these expectations because you're responsible for what's happening because
[02:32:44.340 --> 02:32:45.340]   of that.
[02:32:45.340 --> 02:32:46.340]   And that's what consumer received.
[02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:47.340]   They read autopilot.
[02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:48.940]   They expect autopilot.
[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:49.940]   Exactly.
[02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:53.540]   It's always a pleasure.
[02:32:53.540 --> 02:32:57.060]   Filmcast, the filmcast, the filmcast.
[02:32:57.060 --> 02:32:59.160]   The filmcast.com.
[02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:00.860]   And of course, senior editor at Engadget.
[02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:02.460]   What are you working on over there right now?
[02:33:02.460 --> 02:33:03.460]   Any big stories?
[02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:04.740]   We're in the middle of Sundance right now.
[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:07.020]   So I am just like watching a ton of movies.
[02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:11.540]   I just reviewed this documentary called We Met in Virtual Reality, which is a, it's a
[02:33:11.540 --> 02:33:16.900]   documentary set entirely in VR chat, which is this really cool like social community that
[02:33:16.900 --> 02:33:20.420]   exists in virtual reality and it's been around since 2014.
[02:33:20.420 --> 02:33:22.340]   People have been really leading on it during the pandemic.
[02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:26.860]   So it's about people who have found friendship and relationships in VR chat.
[02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:28.380]   It's a really well done documentary too.
[02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:32.500]   Like they all show the director Joe hunting shot it like a real documentary.
[02:33:32.500 --> 02:33:37.020]   So the camera, it is a virtual camera, but it has depth of field.
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:38.020]   It has like huge show.
[02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:39.020]   Oh, wow.
[02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:40.020]   Yeah.
[02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:41.020]   This is really cool.
[02:33:41.020 --> 02:33:42.020]   Yeah.
[02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:43.020]   Yeah.
[02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:44.020]   Yeah.
[02:33:44.020 --> 02:33:45.020]   And I really like the movie.
[02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:47.740]   for Sundance, but hopefully it'll be streaming somewhere
[02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:49.900]   eventually and it's, it's lovely.
[02:33:49.900 --> 02:33:53.380]   It shows that people are getting a lot out of being in VR
[02:33:53.380 --> 02:33:54.900]   and finding relationships in VR.
[02:33:54.900 --> 02:33:57.520]   And we make one of the metaverse but maybe some element
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:59.740]   of that will be really useful to people down the line.
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:00.560]   - Yeah.
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:03.840]   - So this, it looks a lot like second life.
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:06.500]   This is-- - Better graphics.
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:07.340]   Better graphics.
[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:09.540]   - I mean, you're watching your full finger tracking,
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:10.740]   people are investing in like--
[02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:13.100]   - There's real people, there's a real person in this.
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:13.920]   - Yeah.
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:14.740]   - Real person.
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:16.820]   - You're doing belly dancing and dance courses
[02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:19.020]   and lap dances and stuff in it.
[02:34:19.020 --> 02:34:21.140]   Like it covers everything that's happening
[02:34:21.140 --> 02:34:22.220]   right now in VRChat.
[02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:23.420]   - Very interesting.
[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:24.260]   Are they signing?
[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:25.920]   Are they doing sign language?
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:26.940]   That's what it looked like.
[02:34:26.940 --> 02:34:31.500]   - Yeah, somebody does a virtual signing class.
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:32.500]   And they do it regularly.
[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:35.260]   - And the thing is I could look just like that if I want.
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:38.580]   - You could look like the man with the tail
[02:34:38.580 --> 02:34:39.740]   and the great pecs, yeah.
[02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:42.100]   (laughing)
[02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:43.860]   - Okay, and this is a documentary.
[02:34:43.860 --> 02:34:47.860]   How interesting, Devindra's got a review in gadget.
[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:51.380]   We met in virtual reality, love in the metaverse.
[02:34:51.380 --> 02:34:52.220]   Great to have you on.
[02:34:52.220 --> 02:34:53.300]   Thank you, Devindra.
[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:54.580]   - Thank you, always fun.
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:57.220]   - Thanks also to my old friend Dwight Silverman.
[02:34:57.220 --> 02:35:01.260]   And authorry.com/d-silverman
[02:35:01.260 --> 02:35:02.460]   is where you can find his latest work.
[02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:04.740]   What are you working on today?
[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:06.460]   - Mostly I'm just doing my column.
[02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:08.860]   I'm gonna do something I think on air tags
[02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:10.140]   and stalking next.
[02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:11.460]   - That's an interesting story.
[02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:12.540]   - That is a really interesting story.
[02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:13.460]   - You know, I don't blame Apple.
[02:35:13.460 --> 02:35:14.980]   It just works really well.
[02:35:14.980 --> 02:35:15.820]   - Right?
[02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:17.260]   And what's interesting is you,
[02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:19.540]   I think you're hearing all these stories
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:21.980]   about people finding air tags on them
[02:35:21.980 --> 02:35:24.820]   because the product is doing what it's supposed to.
[02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:27.060]   It's alerting people to it.
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:30.300]   The Android hole is a big problem right now
[02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:33.980]   because Apple has this app that lets you find it,
[02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:35.860]   but you have to turn it on.
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:38.380]   And you have to manually like look for it.
[02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:42.660]   But it's a really interesting conundrum.
[02:35:42.660 --> 02:35:45.740]   I used it to find my keys the other day
[02:35:45.740 --> 02:35:48.700]   'cause my cats had knocked it off a stool
[02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:50.020]   and had fell behind the stool
[02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:51.500]   and I couldn't find my keys.
[02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:53.500]   And it's the first time I used air tag
[02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:55.340]   to really find something and it worked great.
[02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:57.300]   - Yeah, that's so good for keys, yeah.
[02:35:57.300 --> 02:35:58.900]   - Yeah, it's yeah, right.
[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:01.660]   - Yeah, I think Apple kind of got a lot of heat
[02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:03.340]   for the wrong reasons.
[02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:05.060]   You can buy it, they're cheap.
[02:36:05.060 --> 02:36:08.500]   GPS devices, you'll have no idea that it's trading.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:09.340]   And it's much more accurate.
[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:10.180]   - It's true.
[02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:11.140]   It's the ease of use here.
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:12.420]   I'm looking forward to reading your thing, Dwight,
[02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:15.140]   because like the ease of use of it, yeah,
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:16.460]   there's a lot of just weird there.
[02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:17.740]   - It's interesting, yeah.
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:21.220]   - My sister, who is an Android user, was in town
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:24.300]   and had to use my car and she's not familiar with Houston.
[02:36:24.300 --> 02:36:27.260]   I put an air tag in my car.
[02:36:27.260 --> 02:36:30.860]   And I could see where she was because she wasn't on Find My,
[02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:33.180]   but it kept chirping at her because it was,
[02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:34.020]   - Right.
[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:35.420]   - You know, it could sense a phone there,
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:36.660]   but it wasn't an iPhone.
[02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:39.900]   And so it would chirp at her and it drove her nuts.
[02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:40.780]   - Next time do what I do,
[02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:42.580]   just put it in the trunk, she'll never know.
[02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:43.940]   - She'll never know.
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:46.700]   - I'm joking.
[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:48.700]   Thank you, Dwight.
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:49.940]   Thank you, Devendra.
[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:51.220]   - Thank you.
[02:36:51.220 --> 02:36:56.220]   - I'm terrible, but we, just her voice was so bad.
[02:36:56.220 --> 02:36:58.580]   We had to--
[02:36:58.580 --> 02:37:01.220]   - I would love, I'll bring Brianna on the Engadget podcast.
[02:37:01.220 --> 02:37:03.060]   At some point, I would have left a chat with her.
[02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:04.180]   - Good makeup for it.
[02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:05.940]   The makeup for my, our loss.
[02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:07.260]   But we'll also have Brianna,
[02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:08.700]   we'll want to at a later date,
[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:10.940]   but I didn't want it to hurt her throat.
[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:12.380]   She really was sad and--
[02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:13.220]   - It's not rust.
[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:14.060]   - It was painful.
[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:15.900]   - I, my throat always hurts after the show,
[02:37:15.900 --> 02:37:16.740]   'cause we're going for--
[02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:17.580]   - That's a lot of talkin'.
[02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:18.580]   - It's rattle, a lot of talkin'.
[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:20.100]   - How do you think I feel?
[02:37:20.100 --> 02:37:21.820]   (laughing)
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:24.180]   We do a Twitter every Sunday afternoon,
[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:26.420]   2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern.
[02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:30.620]   It's actually more like 2.30, 5.30 Eastern.
[02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:33.060]   2.30 UTC, if you want to watch us through a live,
[02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:35.580]   tune in at two so you can see the setup and all that.
[02:37:35.580 --> 02:37:38.260]   Live.twit.tv, there's audio and video streams there.
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:40.700]   You can chat live at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:37:40.700 --> 02:37:42.140]   Of course, if you're a member of Club Twit,
[02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:45.660]   you can chat at Discord and our Discord server as well.
[02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:47.740]   After the fact on-demand versions of the shows
[02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:49.780]   are on the website, twit.tv.
[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:51.500]   There's also YouTube channel.
[02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:54.780]   You could subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:37:54.780 --> 02:37:56.180]   That way you'll get it.
[02:37:56.180 --> 02:37:59.420]   I mean, it's available of a Sunday evening.
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:01.300]   If you listen as a synchronously,
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:02.500]   if you listen as a podcast,
[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:06.380]   there's still a very active community at our Twit forums.
[02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:10.980]   That's www.twit.community, our discourse forums.
[02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:11.820]   They're really fun.
[02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:13.060]   I go in there all the time.
[02:38:13.060 --> 02:38:15.660]   Twit.social is our Mastodon instance.
[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:20.660]   Kind of like Twitter, only nice and no hexagonal avatars.
[02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:24.900]   Actually, I might make my hexagonal avatar there too.
[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:26.980]   That'd be kind of fun to throw them off.
[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:28.580]   That's twit.social.
[02:38:28.580 --> 02:38:29.420]   They're both free.
[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:30.100]   You're more than welcome.
[02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:31.300]   We'd love to have you.
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:32.660]   Thanks for joining us everybody.
[02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:33.900]   We will see you next time.
[02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:34.980]   Another Twit.
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:36.180]   This is a camera.
[02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:37.020]   Bye bye.
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:40.460]   (upbeat music)
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:42.460]   (upbeat music)
[02:38:42.460 --> 02:38:44.460]   (upbeat music)
[02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:47.460]   Alright, doin' the twit, baby.
[02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:49.280]   Do us a twist.
