[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Welcome back to Twit, this week in tech. I am not.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   It's very obvious. Not Leo Laport. I am Jason Snell from 6colors.com.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And I'm sitting in for Leo this week. I have that privilege. Thank you, Leo, for asking me back.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I'm joined by three wonderful people, none of whom are present with me here.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So their souls have been stolen and placed on large screens nearby to my far left.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It is Dan Moran, my compatriot at 6colors.com, published science fiction novelist, and my favorite Dan today.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Hi, Dan.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Oh, okay. Today. All right. Hi, Jason. I'm glad to have made the cut today, but tomorrow's another day.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Look, there's tomorrow's another Dan there a lot. You know, tomorrow's promised to know Dan.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, to my right, it is from Imor.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And he runs his own wonderful YouTube channel. And of course, you may know him from Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's Renee Richie. Hi, Renee.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Hi, Jason. It's nice to see you.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's great to see you too. I'm sorry that you're in a little TV screen here in the studio rather than, you know, right next to me.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But that's okay. It's so lonely here, but it's good to see you as always.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I'm sorry. It's so dark because the sun's already gone down here on the east.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Did anything happen with Apple this week? Yeah, maybe here and there.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   We'll see. We'll talk a little bit about that, but we've got lots of stuff.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And joining me, one of my favorite guests on a podcast I used to do called download, and I'm glad to have him here on Twitch.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I asked for him personally. It is Devinda. Devinda Harder War. God, I always, it's been too long. I'm out of practice now.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It's Devinda Harder War from Engadget in the flesh in a TV screen for me. Hello.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Hello.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Thank you for having me. I'm looking forward to chatting with all you folks.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Yeah, and we've got some entertainment related things too.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And I know that you, in your spare time, you also do some entertainment podcasting.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So we're going to, the tech world, the entertainment world, they're all jamming together now.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It's a mess. You get your peanut butter and your chocolate, your chocolate and your peanut butter.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It still happens. It's awesome.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But let's start not about tech and not about Apple and not about tech and streaming colliding.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Let's start about the smart home. Smart home. Some news this week that I think it's worth talking about.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Google bought Fitbit. I mean, that's the short version of it.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Google wrote a big check, bought Fitbit. Interesting background here.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   The Apple Watch came out and everybody said smart watches are going to be big.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   The Apple Watch has done pretty well. Android Wear, not so much. Samsung's doing its thing.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   But you know who's been doing really well with wearables on your wrist all along?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It's Fitbit. I know a lot of people who say, "I don't even have an Apple Watch.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I have a Fitbit and I love it." And it's done really well.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Well, here we are. Well, well, well. Google is buying Fitbit.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And I linked to a story on the Verge that was pretty good about this,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   which is basically like, "Well, is it going to be like HTC's phone division?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Or is it going to be like Nest? Poor Nest. Nest just keeps getting brought up
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and Dieter Bone at the Verge brought it up as a--
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   One more to roll up. We all forget that.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It could. Right. Right.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It could be a good one.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I guess there's good ways to get swallowed by Google and they're bad ways.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It seems like mostly bad. Yeah.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So yeah, Dvindra, how do you-- let's start with you.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   How do you feel about this news? I mean, should people who like Fitbits
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   be excited that they've got the backing of Google behind them, this huge company?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Or should they be worried that it's all going to get ruined?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I feel like Fitbit users have a right to be concerned just because Google has not
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   proven itself to be the best steward of older platforms.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And I think Fitbit was really good at doing like it's one thing, right?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Fitness tracking, building these really interesting activity sensors.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   On the smartwatch side of things, you know, we reviewed all their recent ones.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   They're fine, but they could never be as good as the Apple Watch.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So Fitbit needed a push.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Certainly Google needed a big push because I feel like even Google forgot
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Android Wear exists.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So it seems like this is pretty symbiotic, but I don't--
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I have this running theory that Google's just terrible at hardware
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and they bring in all these companies to try to help them out.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And maybe it'll work out this time.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's just I don't-- yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I think there's a real question about whether they're bringing them in to make
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   a new direction because the reason Fitbit-- you mentioned it, the reason they've
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   done so well in part is because they have stuck to their knitting to a certain
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   degree and said, "We're about fitness.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   We're not going to try to be everything to everybody."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And Apple sort of learned that lesson too.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Dan, you sat next to me at that Apple event where they announced the Apple Watch
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and they sort of were all over the place.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And they have refined their message a lot in the last few years.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And I just-- I wonder, is Apple or is Google buying a refined message here
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   with Fitbit and saying, "No, no, no, it really is primarily about fitness."
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I think that's a big part of it.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I mean, obviously, like you said, Apple tried a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   They kind of threw everything at the wall and eventually settled on fitness,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   whereas Fitbit has been doing fitness all along.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So they kind of clearly have their mission mapped out for them there.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Google, obviously, they can get a big leg up in this department.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   I think that's a one major advantage here, as like the vendor said,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   like with Android Wear kind of being like a thing they seem to have largely
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   shrugged about.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   It seems like maybe Fitbit gives them an established brand who can too
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   that have a lot of very loyal users.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And hey, if it doesn't work out, then it breaks in a year.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   They can just buy another company because that's what everybody would have
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   ever had a Fitbit in the protein.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So I think that it seems like a good combination, but I agree that Google's had
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   sort of a bad history when it comes to acquiring hardware brands.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   They either seem to sort of peter out or they just seem like they don't--
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   they lose something essential about themselves.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And I feel like this-- to me, this feels a little bit like when Yahoo bought Flickr,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   everyone was like, Flickr, very specific focus.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   It's great.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Yahoo's going to throw some money into this.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And at the end of the day, Yahoo really could not figure out what to do with Flickr.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And I worry that Google will have the same approach to Fitbit.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Ray, what do you think about this?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I'm going to push back a bit.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I think Fitbit was beloved and people who had them really loved them,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   but I don't think they were particularly successful.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I think that was part of the reason they sold.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It's just really hard to be an independent hardware company.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   They ended up going for not even two times their valuation,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   which is not a very good number for them.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And we saw that with Euro and Amazon.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   We've seen that with a bunch of companies that tried to make it on their own.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And I agree with Davinder completely.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Google has not really proven themselves with hardware.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   They have a super successful software operating system with Android,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   but they've never managed to make it work with tablets, not with smart watches.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   They folded their Pixel Slate division.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And I think the people who have been using this tool,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   they've never sold it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I think that the thing that people love about Fitbit is Fitbit itself
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and just moving that hardware over to Google
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   and having them make some hybrid of Wear OS and Fitbit,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   which you know is just going to plug all that data into Google.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And I think that's actually what they bought.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I think they see the potential for health
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   and they see just how much health data you can accumulate
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and a successful harvesting tool for that.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And I think they're hoping that if they can plug everything about Fitbit
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   into Google's complex, they'll be able to get all that health care data,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   which is also why I don't think they're particularly nervous about people.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Like the offer, you can delete your data from Fitbit if you don't trust us.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I think they're looking forward to all the data they can collect going forward.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And Renee, you're absolutely right.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I don't think Fitbit would have survived on its own for like another year or two.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Like that's a company.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   It is so tough to be a tiny hardware company.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And it's hard to compete with whatever Apple's doing.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   At this point, the Apple Watch can save lives, you know,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   because of the fall detection and the heart rate monitoring.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And like these are things that Fitbit can never really do on its own at this point.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And the Silicon is so hard.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Like we've seen Qualcomm,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Qualcomm has to make money on every chipset they make
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and they can do that in phones because there's so many.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   But there's just no platform for selling watch Silicon.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   So their first chip was a rehashed old phone chip.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Second one was that chip rehashed for the call processor.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And they're trying to do another one.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And meanwhile, Apple is sticking systems and packages in our ears.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And that's going to be a hard thing to compete with.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   There's something in here right now too.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   It seems like Google has the cash injection that they might need for that, right?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Like in a perfect world, Google shovels them a bunch of money
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and that allows them to sort of build out a lot of the processes they couldn't do
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   as a small hardware company.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   But at the same time, we all know that in the ideal world,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   obviously doesn't play out that way a lot of times
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   because you don't know how to deal with all this money you have
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and you have to build these systems from scratch,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   which is the kind of problem Fitbit's running into.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I mean, Apple built its stuff from scratch,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   but it did so over the process of many, many years
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   of sort of laying all the groundwork.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And obviously that's not something that they can necessarily just flip a switch on.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Personally, I think that Fitbit was such a good steward of Pebble
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   that they deserve whatever they get.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Yeah, yeah. I mean, talk about independent hardware companies having a hard time.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Pebble was the first one I thought of and of course Fitbit ended up buying out Pebble.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I think there is a really interesting distinction between being a successful business
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and gaining traction with an audience.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And I feel like the reason that I mentioned Fitbit positively
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   is not necessarily because they weren't burning money and seeking an exit,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   but because I see a lot of those products being used
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and I talk to people who love them,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and I think it's interesting because when everybody in the industry
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   started running in the same direction, which is the direction of the Apple Watch,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   that's where Android Wear went, that's where Samsung took its wearable,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   you know, its watches and stuff too, Fitbit didn't.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And maybe they didn't because they couldn't, but they didn't.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   They said, "Look, we're going to be first and foremost a device for activity tracking and fitness,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and then we'll add some other features on top of it."
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   And when I talk to people who love Fitbit, that's why they like it,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   is the simplicity of it.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And it does make me wonder, you know, whether that was secret sauce
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   or whether it just was happenstance, does Google look at that and say,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   "Okay, maybe this is the lesson to learn here,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   is that we were trying to attack this and be all things to all people,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   and that the success you've got with a product like this
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   is that it's not going to be everything.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   We're not going to compete with Apple directly,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   we're going to compete with them kind of at an angle with Fitbit.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I mean, don't forget the Fitbit.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Don't forget the Fitbit.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Dan and I have a friend who just got an Apple watch because of some health issues,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and he said he's keeping his Fitbit because he can't miss the data on Fitbit.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   You got two wrists.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   He got two wrists.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   He'll sound through the problem.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And two-way.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Come on.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Come on.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Come on.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   It would be the coolest person in the room with two devices on Fitbit.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Your friendship, racelet as well.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   But it does make it fit.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Fitbit survived this first wave event activity trackers,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   and there were a ton of companies doing it, right?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   We forget about Jawbone.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Jawbone had a lot of funding.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Jawbone also was like the pioneer of wireless speakers,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and they were kicking butt for so long.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I honestly love the Jawbone up.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   That was great hardware when it worked.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Their software was great, but they kind of flamed out.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And now it's really Fitbit and Garmin.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Microsoft banned.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And Microsoft banned.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   A lot of things flamed out.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Fitbit was the last independent company left standing.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And now, yeah, maybe Google can have them continue to focus,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   but I don't--
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   I feel like Google has not done much of a health device push on its own,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   too.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   So I'd expect something more interesting than just another activity tracker from them.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Well, it seems like the big advantage there would potentially be integration, right,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   which is what Apple has going for it with the Apple Watch, right?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It's so tightly tied into iOS, all your notifications,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   all the interactions you can do with it, the fact that you can unlock your Mac,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   you can authorize stuff on your Mac now.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   That's all a huge advantage in that place straight into Apple's strengths,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   which are these integrations of hardware, software, and services.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Google has the services and the software.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Like you've said before, the hardware has always been sort of a weak spot for them.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   So is this an opportunity for them to build something that does compete at that level,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   that can offer the same kind of integration that the Apple Watch offers for iOS users,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   but instead for Android users, in theory, seems like that's what Android Wear should have been,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   but it doesn't seem like a handout that way.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Yeah, I do.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Yeah, I was just going to approve Dan's joke earlier and say,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   maybe Google just had Android Wear clip to their belt,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   and they thought it was there, and they looked and it was gone,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   and they're like, "I guess we got to buy another Fitbit?"
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Well, the third party is trying to wait.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   That was the thing, right?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   So all the support died.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   So I wonder if Apple decides they can suck a lot of oxygen out of Google-owning Fitbit
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   by releasing an Apple Watch shuffle that's cross-platform.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Oh, my.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I do want to talk about Apple here just because there was another report today,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   and this was from Bloomberg, or this week,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   about Apple revamping its smart home efforts.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   We had already heard earlier this year that they had brought in somebody new to run their smart home business,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and then this new Bloomberg story, you know, it's going to tell a narrative about Apple
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   falling behind in the number of home kit products that are out there.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   But the idea here is that perhaps Apple is going to be considering entering some smart home product areas
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   that they either abandoned or are not currently in,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   and really stepping up their game here.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Renee, I know you watch this stuff closely.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   What do you think about this report?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Is Apple in the midst of rethinking how it approaches the smart home market?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Well, first, let me just get meta for a second,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   because I love business publications.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   When Google buys Fitbit, it's like Google buys Fitbit to take on Apple.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   When Apple buys or brings in somebody, it's like struggling failing Apple tries to rejuvenate their efforts.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It's always like the narrative is so interesting to me.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   But I think that's true.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I mean, it's a market that Apple brought a really good speaker to a commodity smart speaker market,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and they haven't done particularly well with it.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And they haven't done a lot of other products,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   and those products that did exist have been bought and sealed away.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Amazon bought Ring and bought Echo.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   They've got an investment in Echo.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Google has all these products.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Samsung has their own routers.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Google has their own routers.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Apple got rid of their routers.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   And I think that they don't own the key components that are necessary to be competitive in the home,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   and the components that were really, really good have all been bought.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And a lot of them mysteriously have not delivered on the HomeKit functionality they promised before they were bought.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And I think that ends up being a big problem at the end of the day.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I think it's an opportunity for Apple to lead by example in the HomeKit arena,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   where they can actually produce stuff first-party potentially and say,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   "Look at all the cool stuff you can do with HomeKit,"
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and like, you kind of show off all the features,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   because there's stuff there that's differentiators.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   They've hammered on, but it's not stuff yet that has really made its way into the grand scheme of things.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   So for example, the privacy stuff, the stuff they talked about last year at WWC
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   when they talked about the HomeKit router support and being able to say,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "Storrier security cam footage in your iCloud,"
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   which has more privacy and security restrictions than some of the third-party provider.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I think the ability for them to sort of say, like, "All right, let's put it together ourselves,"
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   which again, plays to their strengths of integration.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   It always struck me as strange that they decided to launch this sort of protocol.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   HomeKit was very slow to get off the ground.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   It got much better once they started doing things like not requiring everyone to build in hardware authentication chips,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   but it's also one of those things where I think in order to show off all the things it's really great at,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   it would really help Apple to sort of create a template and be like,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   "Here is an example of a fantastic HomeKit smart home technology.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Here are all the benefits it has, and here's why you should choose it over another smart home ecosystem."
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Yeah. I mean, I feel like the big reason Apple has not really hit this out of the park is also because nobody has.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   I feel like going to CS over the last five years,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   honestly, since 2010, since I started going, everyone's talking about the smart home,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   they're all these competing standards.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   There's a lot of stuff going on, but it's a lot of talk,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   and I think the functional benefits to a lot of consumers is not quite there.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   It's there for a couple of products, it's there for the Nest thermostat, it's there for the hue, light bulbs,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   but that's kind of it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Beyond that, it's a lot of little things that people may or may not like security cameras and things like that.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   But this also feels like a market where Apple has this tendency to sit back a little and watch how everybody else plays out
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   while they dog food their stuff internally to try to offer a better option.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Right now, nobody has even done anything that's super successful.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   So Apple has had to kind of, to me, that's why HomeKit took so long to even get going,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   is kind of maybe they were waiting to see what everybody else was doing,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   and even that was slow to get going.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Apple does have this dichotomy between wanting to control everything
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   and also wanting to get other companies to build things so that they don't have to.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And you saw it with HomeKit, as Dan mentioned, that they were like,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   "You need a hardware authentication chip," and then nobody did it, and they said,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   "Okay, how about some software? We could do it that way," and they backed off of it.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And I do wonder if Apple came out with a product in a class,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   whatever it would be, a lock or a camera or whatever, maybe a Wi-Fi base station.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   What message would they send?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I fear that the message would be, "Don't get in this market because we're Apple and we're going to own it."
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   So being a partner of Apple, it's a challenge, right?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   They have to find a way to make it a welcoming environment.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   People want to be in HomeKit and take advantage of Apple's ecosystem without getting stomped on by Apple.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   There's a weird self-contradictory message there, too,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   because, like, for example, I would love Apple to get back in the router market,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   and I think all the stuff they talked about at WWC in terms of integrating HomeKit stuff into the router
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And they can sort of skate by there because they can point out we were in the router market,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   we certainly didn't dominate that market by any means.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   So there is still an opportunity for third parties there,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   but it always struck me as crazy.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   They decided to get out of that market right around the time it kind of felt like we could really use them in that market,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   especially as things like privacy and security are getting to be much, much bigger concerns for consumers,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   especially, really, it's a smart home device, right?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Like, there's one story after another about malware that's starting to infect smart home devices,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   and it feels like if Apple gets to be the one to push the narrative of,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   "Hey, we can secure this and lock it down so that you don't have to worry that your light bulbs are going to compromise your computer,"
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   that feels like a big win for me.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   There's also interesting that the whole Apple thing with the HomeKit by itself is a framework,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   and that's the name they went to market with.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   It's not Apple Home or anything much more consumer friendly.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   It's like marketing the iPhone is like UIKit.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   It's just, or the Mac is AppKit.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   They don't do that normally.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   And it doesn't feel as friendly as approachable, it doesn't have anywhere nearly the partner support.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And Samsung, again, they have all their own stuff, and Amazon has all their own stuff,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and Google has all their own stuff, and Apple doesn't.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   And I think that's increasingly a competitive cause of concern for them.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   I look at the HomePod as a prime example too of how, I guess it's a smart home device too as a smart speaker,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   but it's not compatible with Bluetooth.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   You really need Apple Music to use that thing.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   It's locked down in so many ways.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It's inconvenient to anybody who's not a part of the Apple ecosystem, so not a huge surprise.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   It wasn't a major success.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   But the other thing too is the practical ways of using HomeKit.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   How do you go HomeKit Hub?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Well, I googled it, and if you have an Apple TV, if you have an iPad, if you have a HomePod,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   you could set that up as a hub.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   But the practical ways of using HomeKit products is also kind of tough.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   It's hard.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   They haven't really sold the benefits, and they haven't really sold a way to make your life easier with any of these things.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Right, there's a messaging issue that needs to be worked out there.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I think that's a big part of it.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   If you already know, if you're already in the tech sphere and you're kind of savvy about smart home stuff,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   you can kind of figure out how to make it work.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I've got a great HomeKit set up here, but it's not a thing that I would ever recommend necessarily to my average non-techy friend to be like,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   "Oh, yeah, you definitely need to set up all your light bulbs on the internet, because it's really a huge success there."
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Well, it is early days.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   There's no doubt about it, whether there's an advantage that's going to bear out, or whether it's, you know,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   it'll also play for, or whether it never ends up being quite as big a deal as everybody wants it to be.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Remains me, seem.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   We have so much more to talk about on Twitch. The new Apple AirPods Pro came out.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   The streaming wars. We found out more about HBO Max and what that's going to be, and of course Apple TV
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   plus finally launched after two years of talking about it.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   New things in social media, and I want to talk about, I lost power for three days.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Some interesting tech angles to the California fires and blackouts.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Lots to talk about, but first I need to take a break because Leo, who is currently on assignment,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I think he's floating in a cloud somewhere, but before he left he had some special messages
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   and he's going to deliver one to you right now.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Having a great time this week on Twitch, I'm stepping back in just for a moment to tell you about LastPass,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   because I'm the resident expert here at Twitch.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   I've been using LastPass for 10 years. Love LastPass.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   It was a few years ago that we had a little kind of an identity crisis here at Twitch.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   One of our employees put all of his passwords, including important stuff like website and so forth
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   on the web, on a public website, because he can remember his passwords.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   That's when Russell said, "You know, I put my clients on LastPass, maybe you should too."
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Thank you, Russell. We love LastPass. It wasn't hard.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I've been using LastPass forever.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   LastPass Personal, actually it's called Premium. That's the one I was using.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Then of course when I got married, Lisa and I started using LastPass families.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   We could easily share passwords with one another. She's also my designated emergency access
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   if anything should happen to me. I think that's really, really important.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   One of my favorite features. You know what's great about LastPass?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   They're always adding new features, new ideas.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Like this, for LastPass Enterprise, over 43,000 organizations use LastPass in their business, like us.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Honestly, this is a big deal.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   You're probably accessing different password protected accounts all over the place,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   whether it's smartphone apps on your watch, on the web, your laptop.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   The LastPass mobile app.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Yes, the LastPass mobile app lets you continue to have the safety and security of logging in anytime anywhere.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   One master password, LastPass remembers the rest, and the mobile app works everywhere you are.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Your LastPass account is backed up and synced across all your devices,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   but it's only decrypted, ever only decrypted on your device.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   It locks itself if the device locks itself.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   I never worry. In fact, I trust LastPass so much.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   As I travel on vacation, I put my passport, my social security numbers, my driver's license, everything.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   I put it in LastPass. That's the most secure place I've got for storing my most important documents,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   and of course all my passwords.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   You remember the master password, let LastPass remember the rest.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   iOS, Android, Mac, PC. I use it on Linux. I use it on every browser.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And the autofill on mobile devices means I'm not... I can't use those little dinky keyboards.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I don't have to. LastPass fills it in automatically.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   You swipe into the LastPass app with your fingerprint so it's even more secure.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Safety and security always. I use LastPass at home.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   We use LastPass at Twit.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   We are a LastPass family.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   I want you to join the family. Get LastPass for home for your business.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And by the way, you've got to check out the expanded business lineup with features that improve security
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   across your company, but also make life easier for your users.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   It's a great combination.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   LastPass.com/Twit. Find out what LastPass can do for you.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I can't recommend it more highly.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   If you've got passwords, and I know you do, get LastPass.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   LastPass.com/Twit.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Oh, back to the show.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Sometimes I come on the show and there's very exciting new hardware that's been announced.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   New computers, new phones.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Leo often has a brand new phone that is the latest in his weekly purchases of smartphones.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   I think he's got a subscription plan.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   So every smartphone comes to Leo's house.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   It's very nice.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   This week, not that much in the realm of new hardware, but Apple did with no fanfare really.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Beyond a press release, release new AirPods.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And AirPods, obviously, very, very well liked the original AirPods.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I've got mine here.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And this time we got AirPods Pro.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   How do you make professional Pro?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Whatever that means, headphones.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Well, let me show you what's going on here.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   So these are new.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   They're noise canceling.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   They're in-ear.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   They've got silicone tips.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Let me show for people watching the video.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   These are the old kind.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   You know, familiar.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   They've got the buds with the long stems.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   This new case, it's wide.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   It's much wider than the old one.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And inside are buds that are larger because they've got the silicone tips and they've got
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   smaller stems.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And they've got a new feature, which is instead of kind of whacking the side of your head in
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   order to go to the next track or the previous track, you actually squeeze a little area on the
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   stem itself.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And that's the thing that will advance you forward or back.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   There's actually a little force sensitive area and you squeeze it.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And if you squeeze and hold, you can turn on something called transparency mode, which is
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   a pass-through mode or full-on noise cancellation as much as any earbuds can be noise canceling
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   because they're not completely covering your ears.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   So I know that two members of my panel join me in having a pair of these AirPods Pro.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Dan, let's start with you.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   What are you thinking?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   You're not wearing them right now.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   You're in the over years on right now.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.680]   How are you feeling about AirPods Pro a few days in?
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.100]   I do have them here.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.160]   I'm struggling a little bit and that's mainly because I'm not a person who likes earbuds
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.720]   or in-ear headphones that much.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.600]   I usually prefer over-ear headphones and some of it is struggling with just the fit for
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.520]   me for whatever reason.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.520]   My ears don't work great within ear headphones.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.140]   I will say in my experience in the last few days wearing them, they are the best in-ear
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.820]   headphones I have ever worn in terms of comfort and in terms of all the other features they
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.440]   offer, especially integration with iOS stuff.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.240]   But fundamentally, what they have found out for me is still just being silicone tipped
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.600]   in ear headphones that I have trouble getting a good seal in one of my ears and I've tried
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.000]   the whole switching the different tips which they allow.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.740]   But I always feel like I'm worried one of them is going to fall out or I don't have
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.800]   a really good sound in one ear.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   And so that's the biggest problem.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.940]   I really want to love them because all the features that I use, I really kind of are
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.940]   delightful.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.260]   So for example, the fact that it pauses when you take your earbud out, which obviously
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.260]   the original earpods did as well, that I really like the Force sensor.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:53.700]   I think it's a satisfying, haptic style control and I think the sound is pretty darn good
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.180]   for something that's that small.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.180]   And these are impressively small, I will have to say, you compared the stems being much
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.180]   shorter.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.980]   Like walking around and seeing a lot of people wearing the original earpods, they're pretty
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.480]   good, they're pretty small.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.940]   But at the same time, you would sort of notice those long white stems and think, "Baa, it
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.500]   looks a little dorky, doesn't it?"
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.780]   And I think that Apple has improved their design a lot with these.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:21.320]   But at the end of the day, I'm just a little worried that I will not find them comfortable
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.020]   enough to replace the other headphones that I tend to wear all the time.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:33.460]   And can I then justify a $250 purchase for something that I'll only be kind of on?
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.460]   So I think that's where I'm struggling.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.620]   I've worn them a bunch in the last couple of days, walked around town with them, tried
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.900]   them in a coffee shop.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   The noise canceling stuff is great.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.380]   I'm really impressed by it.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.380]   It's not perfect.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.860]   I would think my QC35 Bose headphones still do a better job on average.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.100]   But again, for earbuds, they're pretty darn impressive.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.100]   So I wish I could love them more, but I'm a little stuck on just the sad fact that my
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.900]   ears are broken.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.500]   Yeah, you're hearing it wrong, Dan.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.500]   Apparently.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.500]   Renee, what's your take?
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.300]   You're wearing them right now, aren't you?
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.540]   Yeah, I mean, I had a similar issue with Dan as that my ears have been grappled into
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.900]   mushy oblivion.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.020]   And the previous AirPods, the left one would stay in pretty much most of the time, but
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.020]   the right one I always had issues with.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.700]   These I can get both of them to stay in.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.140]   I did the test and it said it was fine on the medium, but they didn't stay in that well.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.980]   So I switched to the small and they're staying in way better.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.540]   So that I really like about them.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.020]   I haven't been a huge fan of noise canceling before.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.620]   I did have the Bose, the original Bose in here.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.300]   And I've had a variety of over the year.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.060]   I even have the new Beats Solo Pro on ear.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.060]   And I find those just a little bit claustrophobic.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.060]   Like it shuts out too much of the world.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.900]   And I just love the sleekness of AirPods.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.540]   So this to me, they have all the convenience.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.780]   They're just so easy to pair, so easy to switch, so easy to control.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.580]   All of that from the original AirPods plus the advantage of noise cancellation when I
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:02.500]   really want or need it, which is like being on a plane or being on a train or just we've
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.860]   had really bad winds, like 106 kilometer an hour winds.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.100]   And it shakes the whole place.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.900]   It was super noisy and I put these in.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.300]   No music, no video, nothing.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.140]   And it just took all of that out.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.100]   And it probably wouldn't help me see the cars come flying at the windows, but it did
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.140]   help me sort of relax and get the work done that I needed to.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.860]   So I still know colors, you know, which I think is a bit of a bummer because those
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.860]   were rumored as well.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.460]   And there's still like one or two other little things.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.660]   And people who are high end audio files or, you know, golden ears will tell you maybe
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.500]   they don't sound as good as the Sony or they don't sound as good as the cans that you put
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.500]   over your ears.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.580]   But I don't have anywhere nearly that quality of hearing.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.540]   So to me, they're really great.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.540]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.660]   I'm an in-ear headphone guy.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.620]   So I've never liked the over-ear headphones.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:53.820]   And I did actually buy for various reasons a pair of Sony noise canceling headphones last
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.020]   year to wear on various plane rides.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.780]   And they were fine, but I look at these and I think if these can get me what I got out
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.100]   of those Sony's are even close, even if they don't sound as good, even if they don't block
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.940]   out as much sound.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.340]   One of the things that Apple made a big deal about is that they have event system in them
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.780]   so that they're not going to kind of have lead to sort of pressure imbalances, which
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:20.260]   is was my problem with my old in-ear headphones is that I would take them on flights and the
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.940]   pressure imbalance would give me like headaches and things like that.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.940]   Very bad.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:29.820]   And so I'm intrigued by this and I want to try them out on a plane quite frankly.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.980]   But and I regret buying those Sony noise canceling headphones now because I really don't like
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.340]   the over-ear headphones.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:42.580]   So for me as somebody who likes sticking these earbuds in your ear canal, it works pretty
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.580]   well for me.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:48.260]   So you know, again, it's not a custom fit, which I'm actually more accustomed to.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:53.980]   It is nice that although Apple of course reinvented the connector, of course they did,
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.820]   it is a connector that presumably will be knocked off by almost everybody.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.700]   And so if you don't like the three different sizes of tips that Apple keeps in the box,
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:08.740]   includes in the box with the AirPods Pro, you can go out probably within days if not
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.780]   then soon.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.840]   And there will probably be some other options from third parties because everybody will
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.780]   knock it off and maybe you can find a perfect fit.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.780]   But I'm, you know, I-
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.780]   Would you think it'll be a MFI?
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.780]   Yeah, yeah, sure.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.340]   I don't think there's going to be a licensing program for it.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.380]   I think you're going to have to seek the, seek the gray market.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.380]   It's really interesting.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.220]   So DaVinjra, I know you haven't had a chance to play with these.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.220]   It is interesting.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.660]   They're bringing these in above the existing AirPods, which aren't going away.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:38.980]   It costs $50 more than the regular AirPods with the Qi charging case.
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.020]   These are, you know, $250 pair of earbuds.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.180]   They're not cheap, but at the same time the AirPods have done incredibly well.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.500]   So you know, what do you think is going to happen with these?
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.060]   Are there going to be a hit like that was?
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.180]   I don't like I see a lot of people complaining about that premium.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.700]   And honestly, I don't think the $200 AirPods, I don't know if we've ever gotten like broken
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:06.380]   down sales because 40 bucks more than the what $160 standard AirPods with the normal
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.380]   case.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:10.980]   It's not seem worth it for the Qi charging just because Qi is slow and honestly less
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.980]   convenient.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.220]   So that never really seemed like a good bet for me.
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:19.340]   The AirPods were kind of standouts because they were one of the first wireless buds to
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.260]   kind of do that thing well.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.860]   Sound decent, have good reception, not have the pairing issues as others have had.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.020]   I personally haven't been a huge fan.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.300]   I feel like talking about weird ears.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:36.060]   I think my ears are just so funky because I can't hold any AirPods in my head for too
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.060]   long.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.940]   I can't hold any airPods in my head if I shake a little, they come flying out.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.260]   So I'm very happy.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:46.500]   There's finally another option with silicone tips that will presumably stay in place more.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.020]   We should talk about some of the competitors.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.500]   And I feel like you guys mentioned the Sony cans, which I really love.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.820]   Those are fantastic, but they did also just release earbuds to the WF-1000XM3s.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.860]   And those coming at $230.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.740]   Those things sound like miracle earbuds to me.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.900]   They sound as good as high quality earbuds and the noise canceling isn't as good as the
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.940]   over the ear version, but it's still pretty good.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.340]   The only downside is that those are much, much bigger than the AirPods.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.820]   They don't look as sleek.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.820]   But yeah, I think if somebody is a quality, really concerned about quality, maybe wants
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.220]   better noise canceling, those seem like a solid option.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.700]   And those are $230 too.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.540]   So you know, Apple's pricing does seem a little much given that the best competition
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.780]   out there right now is coming in much slower.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:36.100]   You see, I look at that and I think, wow, only $20 more for the Apple product.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.300]   That's shows some restraint on Apple's products.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.580]   Surely, get around up even further when you're looking at the Apple product there.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.180]   And yeah, you know, in ear earbuds are never going to be the same as the cans.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.660]   I think it's interesting to see the competition here.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.740]   You know, I think it's funny.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:58.500]   Apple has done really well with the AirPods, despite, I don't think anyone would say that
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.740]   they have the highest quality sound, right?
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.380]   That's never been a thing for them.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.620]   And it's funny, all of you have mentioned the shape of the ear is something that Apple
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.780]   mentioned to me when I was talking to them about this, that I haven't heard a lot of
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.780]   discussion of.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.820]   And they didn't go too far down this path, but I read some things into it that I think
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:23.860]   are interesting, which is that they did, for the original ear pods, which then got turned
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.500]   into the AirPods shape, but they're basically the same as the wired headphones that they
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.500]   made.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.860]   They had a base of ears that they measured in order to kind of come up with a universal
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.260]   fit, quote unquote, for their earbuds.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:44.100]   What they say is that for this product, they went around the world and measured many more
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.100]   ears in order to figure out what the universe of ear sizes and shapes was.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.820]   And you know, they didn't go much beyond that, but that strikes me as being actually
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:56.580]   kind of one of these Silicon Valley stories where they measure a bunch of their friends
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.500]   in Silicon Valley and say, we've got it, we've got the universal ear fit.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.060]   And then they go out and realize that the world is very big.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.060]   And there are many more ears, shapes and sizes that they weren't aware of.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.620]   And that might mean that if you've had Apple buds that never fit your ears before, maybe
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:16.100]   these will do a better job because Apple seems to have understood that their measurements
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.340]   didn't really actually universally fit.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:23.860]   I'm waiting for when they invent some new material that's like the Apple goo, like molds
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.100]   to the shape of your ears when you put it in and then wraps around your brain stem.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.140]   Yeah, you can never take them out and you're prone to suggestion.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.420]   Why would you want to Jason?
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.420]   Why would you ever want to take them out?
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.580]   It's like hitchhiker's stand.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.220]   You just put the little creature in and it does it all for you.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.220]   Could be.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.580]   That was the Futurama iPod in Futurama, right?
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.700]   Like it just like went into your eyes or something.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.780]   It is funny that Apple is talking about that as some sort of like amazing innovation when
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.500]   like every single frickin headphone company has realized, let's put three sizes of tips
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.020]   in there.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.940]   People have different ears and honestly some people I also feel like I have different
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.100]   size tips for each ear too and a lot of folks don't quite realize that.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.860]   Yeah, I struggle with that is I'm kind of in the same boat as Renee, which is like I
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.740]   get a good seal in like one ear and the other ear is like, no, it doesn't really matter
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   which size you use.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.860]   I'm just not going to stay put and that's so annoying.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:20.220]   It's like I'm halfway there like 50% to getting AirPods Pro and the other sense like,
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.900]   nope, well, only works in one ear, I only get mono.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.180]   That's not as good and it's very bad for your noise canceling.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.180]   Really?
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.140]   Because you've got the other ear just totally open.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.980]   So what does it, I think it actually turns it off if you have it in one ear.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.580]   I've noticed that when I was in connection.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.780]   Yeah, no, it's a big step ability and put it back on but I don't know if that would
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.340]   really accomplish.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:48.700]   It's a big step for Apple to let you choose your butt tip size and we should say that
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.980]   small, medium and large is all in the box so you can do it and it's this funny connection
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:59.700]   system where they're oval shaped and you snap them on and you can feel a little snap
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.940]   and then they attach.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.180]   So it's not like the headphones you might be used to where there's sort of a plastic
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.260]   tube and you kind of push the silicone tip over it.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.420]   It's a little bit different.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.420]   Of course it is.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.180]   Apple has reinvented the silicone tip for earbuds.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.180]   Revolutionized.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.020]   Of course they did.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.340]   It's right for the holiday season.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.260]   I imagine that they'll sell a lot of them.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.580]   I think it's kind of funny given that there was that second generation of the original
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.620]   earpods earlier this year.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:32.500]   I know a lot of people who bought that generation who are unlikely to jump into AirPods Pro but
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.300]   it's hard not to look at the success of the AirPods and think that in the end they're
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:43.180]   going to sell a lot of these because it's what happened with the last product.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.780]   People love this product.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.620]   It does work amazingly well even though it's not the best sound.
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.540]   Certainly if you haven't tried wireless earbuds before as Davindra said there are a lot of
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.020]   different models out there but maybe if you're like me and you always despaired because all
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:03.740]   the great noise canceling was in big over ear headphones.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.740]   You've got options now that don't make your ear sweaty.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:16.820]   I also think Apple deserves a little praise on this for as opposed to the original AirPods
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.900]   they announced a product and it was there the next day.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.900]   That was cool.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.300]   Maybe they learned their lesson with air power.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:30.740]   Maybe it's funny that they weren't talked about at the event at the iPhone event.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.580]   It seems like they could have just dropped the line about this too but maybe that would
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.260]   have been too overcrowded.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.660]   This one say it is worth mentioning Microsoft showed off surface earbuds and those look
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.220]   really like everyone's playing around with fit and comfort and I tried those on and they
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.740]   look like earring.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.100]   They look like ear gauges those big round earrings.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.580]   They fit really interestingly.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.100]   There's no noise canceling.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.980]   They're completely open in the way the AirPods are but I think the fit is fantastic and Google
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.900]   like weirdly teased the next pixel buds which will show up maybe next year at some point
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:04.900]   who knows.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.900]   It's better.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.220]   Everyone's getting into this now and it kind of makes sense because the tech go buds too
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.220]   right.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.220]   Oh God.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.220]   And those are terrible.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.220]   So yeah we just reviewed those in gadget.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.220]   They're awful.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.220]   Never buy first gen Amazon hardware people.
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.580]   But yeah everyone's doing this now.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.780]   It seems like the the hardware to make wireless buds has come down quite a bit and now we're
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.060]   seeing the really innovative side of things and at least there's strong competition.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.060]   My vote is for the Sony's.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.780]   I've been using those for like the past since they came out and they're the best like headphones
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.660]   to walk around New York with.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.380]   Yeah I think the the advantage that an Apple product might have over the Sony's would be
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.660]   with their wireless chip.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:45.820]   If you're somebody who's in the Apple ecosystem and you're switching among different devices
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.860]   Apple has got you there because having those Sony headphones it is a little bit more work
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:54.940]   to switch from like my iPad to my iPhone to my Mac and Apple Apple will do that really
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.940]   well if you're using all Apple products.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.500]   So that's but if you're not.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.500]   That's how they get you.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.500]   It's not an advantage.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.500]   That is so sneaky.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.540]   It's also a 10 core chip and a system in package in your ear.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:11.220]   I just I just hope or wonder if they have a plan for the future where we have sort of
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.300]   much more much more going on in these things than we can currently do with them now.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:20.420]   It would not surprise me if you know this is we can have an argument about what augmented
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.260]   reality is and what it isn't.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:27.180]   But I think once you're building devices that are intercepting sound and modifying
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.340]   it and passing it through to your ear you are kind of already augmenting reality at that
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.580]   point and what you do with that in the long run could be really interesting.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:40.540]   I have to say that the using the Siri part of the AirPods and I didn't have the original
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.740]   AirPods so this was sort of a first time for me but like having them in especially with
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:48.580]   the noise canceling on and you just start talking to Siri and I found in most cases
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.660]   it worked surprisingly well but it was kind of interesting to be like walking around and
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.860]   have I think it's the closest you can get to having like a Jarvis from the Ironman kind
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.220]   of just like hey you know what Siri I want to listen to this song and it's like yeah
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.940]   here you go and I was like this is super weird and they have that new feature as well where
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.340]   you can read your off if you don't like it but if somebody sends you a text it doesn't
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:12.780]   even ask you it just tells you who call who sent you a text and what the text says.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   It just tells you.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.780]   Kind of cool.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.780]   I like the creating.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.100]   They're finally indicating better too I say like put on Avengers endgame my Apple TV and
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.540]   it just the TV turns on and it starts playing and just walking around with AirPods.
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.100]   It's always on for you Renee isn't it?
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.300]   It's right in place in the permanent way I just loop in endgame once in a while.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:33.380]   Speaking of streaming media this is I have been telling people about the fact that Apple
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:39.500]   hired some executives from Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony TV two years ago more than two years
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:45.140]   ago to make shows that were not carpool karaoke and Planet of the Apps and for two years people
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.940]   have said but I don't see any of those shows what's going on.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:55.980]   On Friday Apple TV plus launched and we actually got to see what Apple is doing in the world
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.900]   of TV Apple is now a TV streaming service and I want to talk about it and I want to talk
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:06.140]   about what AT&T is doing but before we do any of that I want to give Leo a chance to
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.220]   return from his exile once again momentarily and tell you about something very cool.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:15.860]   Hey I don't want to interrupt but I have to because I am a fresh books customer I wanted
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:21.100]   to tell you about fresh books it is the number one accounting software in the cloud way back
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:26.940]   when in 2004 we had to go to Canada to do call for help I hated invoicing.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.940]   Who does?
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.940]   Who does love invoicing?
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.940]   Nobody does.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:34.180]   It's horrible but you have to do it or you don't get paid I just put it off.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.540]   I was always whining about it.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.300]   Amber told me about this brand new company in Toronto fresh books that it just started
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.300]   up.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.460]   I started using it changed my life it made it easy to do invoicing but the thing about
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:50.060]   it with fresh books you're not just really doing invoicing it's an accounting solution.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:55.940]   With no extra effort on your part you can automate everything invoicing organizing expenses you
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:00.260]   can even use the fresh books app to take a picture of the expense and put it in an invoice
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.260]   or just keep track of it.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.380]   It will automatically download expenses from your bank account you can track time and
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.620]   hours you know hit the website hit the button and it starts recording you have different
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:14.700]   prices for different projects even with the same client phone also you can track hours
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.460]   that's fantastic goes right into the invoice.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:22.300]   Follow up with clients it's easy it's in the app as well as on the website.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:27.940]   In fact it's all in there so it makes it so easy to run your business from anywhere.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.420]   Fresh books is always getting better always finding new ways to make your experience better
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:36.460]   they have now the option to access fresh books using Google sign in which is nice because
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:42.420]   that also means you have multi-factor authentication that's as you know I'm saying everybody needs
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:48.620]   to turn it on it enhances security and you can limit or even revoke data access to third
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:53.540]   party sites and apps so your control is much better it's like basically hiring a security
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:58.500]   force to stay in guard over your private information simplicity and security then get any better
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.980]   than that.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.420]   If you've already got fresh books running and you have a Google account you can log in
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:09.180]   using the Google sign in one click a process which is so great it just pops up an approval
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.660]   on your phone and says you approve this login yeah yeah that's me.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.780]   If you're a small business using a Google account and you want to sign up for fresh books
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:21.180]   it's that easy it's one click boom and you're there.

[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.220]   free now back to the show.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:14.700]   Alright this week Apple joined Amazon Netflix in the realm of being an entertainment provider
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:20.020]   on their own with Apple original programming on the new Apple TV plus service which debuted
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:25.820]   November 1st free if you bought a qualifying Apple hardware product in the last couple
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:33.900]   of months and for a year and for 99 a month for everyone else launching okay I'm gonna
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:39.740]   say it this is whoever the marketing genius who came up with this one they get a cookie.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:45.740]   Apple is boasting that this service is the world's first originals only streaming service
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:51.500]   what that means is that they didn't buy any catalog content there's no no there's no
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:57.940]   sitcoms or no repeats or detective shows from the 70s or anything that you've seen before
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:03.300]   it's only a handful of shows that were made specifically for Apple TV plus and there is
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:08.940]   an argument to be made that with such a limited supply of programming it's kind of hard for
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.660]   Apple to make the case that this service is worth buying then again if you bought any
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.940]   Apple hardware in the last couple of months guess what you can get it for a year for free
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:23.700]   instead of having to pay for 99 a month so the services out the the shows are out they're
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:28.860]   not doing a weekly release or a binge drop they're doing a hybrid where they've released
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.140]   I think three episodes of a lot of shows some things they've dropped a whole season but
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.860]   they are going to do weekly releases of their top line shows from this point so rather than
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.180]   doing the Netflix thing quite honestly they don't have enough shows right they would drop
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:45.540]   them all and then they would go away for several months and nothing would happen on the service
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:51.500]   so instead they're doing weekly releases after in the case of things like see in the morning
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:57.380]   show and for all mankind dropping three episodes on day one so we can talk about this is from
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.660]   a strategy perspective if you've seen the shows we could talk about whether the shows
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:05.020]   are any good or not I'm gonna bet that they're better than Planet of the Apps but beyond that
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:10.860]   I don't know Dan what have you seen of Apple TV plus I've watched the first three episodes
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:16.260]   of the morning show and that that's so far that's it as far as the originals thing go
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:24.060]   it did remind me of I think it was maybe in the late 90s or early 2000s NBC had a slogan
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.060]   that they would run sometimes when they were reruns if you haven't seen it it's new to
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.860]   you and I always thought that was such a brilliant tautology of like well of course like if you
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.460]   haven't seen it it's new and in the same case I feel like that's sort of what Apple's spinning
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:40.500]   here I've I've actually like the morning show I know this received kind of mixed reviews
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:46.020]   it's something that kind of appeals to me and it's on I feel like it reflects certainly
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:51.860]   that they put a lot of money into the show it looks good it's got really top talent even
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:56.980]   down to like the supporting cast or like there's a lot of faces that you recognize is it
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:01.380]   the kind of thing that's actually going to go out and win say an Emmy I don't think so
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:06.260]   I don't think that it will but I think it's a solid effort and it's enjoyable enough that
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:11.220]   when I finished the first episode I kept watching and if there had been more I probably would have
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:16.340]   kept watching them by now so you know in some to some extent that's all that really matters
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:22.100]   and from a larger business question there is a there is a question of what success looks like
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:26.820]   for Apple here obviously if you're giving away your service for a whole year to most of
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.580]   at least your most devoted customers probably the people most likely to pay for the service
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:35.380]   then obviously you're not pulling in a lot of revenue that's purely based on the content
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:39.700]   that you've spent millions and millions of dollars if not built actually there's billions of dollars
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:45.540]   on us that's yeah so you spend a lot of money that's a lot of investment to recoup and it's not
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:49.700]   something that you're necessarily pulling in a lot of subscription money from on day one or even
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:56.340]   on day 365 so I think this is a larger play from Apple and this is still sort of the
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:03.700]   planting their flag in the sand who say like hey we've got this as an option this is you know
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:09.620]   this is a competition to Amazon it's part of our whole package that we are sort of offering to
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:15.460]   people who use the Apple ecosystem and you know it's gonna be it's gonna be good stuff I mean like
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:21.300]   I think there's nothing so far that I've heard is absolute trash I know there's some stuff that
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:27.140]   has gotten worse reviews than others but I think they've realized and to a certain extent in order
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:33.060]   to exist as this mega tech company in this day and age that original content for whatever reason
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:38.660]   is a part of that equation so I'm curious to see how they end up justifying sort of like
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:44.340]   does it bring in people to buy other devices or subscribe to other services what is the end of
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.460]   the day value proposition for this or is it just something that we feel like
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:53.380]   it's an investment in the longer term ecosystem and it's kind of hard to figure out exactly how
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:57.620]   much money we're gonna make out of it right because it's billions of dollars that they're spending
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:05.860]   on this content billions of dollars today this was available in Canada among many many other
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:12.420]   countries that's one of the things that's unique I think in this launch is that Apple built it for
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:17.060]   international and so it's not gonna we're gonna talk about what AT&T is doing with HBO Max which
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:22.100]   is a US-only service essentially but you got to see this stuff in Canada right?
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:27.700]   Yeah I mean there are services that have fairly good like Netflix has built out fairly good
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:32.420]   international representation but because it is so like the licensing model is so fragmented and
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:36.260]   it's filled with these little different fiefdoms you don't have the same catalogs globally and
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:41.780]   it's incredibly frustrating I'll go to watch some I read I subscribe to CBS all access and I'll go
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.020]   to watch a show and I'll hit the button and it'll bounce me into one of my local cable apps because
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.620]   they have the rights in Canada and then they want me to put in a cable subscription which I don't
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:53.780]   have and so I can't watch the thing that's part of the service that I'm already paying to watch and
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:58.100]   endlessly frustrating but because it's original is only Apple owns all the rights to them and
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:03.540]   they can put them in hundreds of you know hundred plus countries right away and I think that's great
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:08.340]   and I think in general if Apple decided they had to do it this was probably the best way for them
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:13.140]   to do it it's a very Apple way to do it like if we have these billions of dollars we want to help
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:18.260]   tell great stories let's go out and let's just tell the best stories like we don't make
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:23.060]   four phones a year the way one plus does we make like we have our our shot of phones all at one
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:29.380]   time they're just making a few series all at once and they're going to be top notch series I mean
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:35.460]   the morning show isn't the newsroom and sea is not Game of Thrones by any means they started off
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:40.100]   with good ingredients that weren't stirred very well they got better over the episodes and to
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.260]   Dan's point like I would have just kept watching the morning show if all the episodes have been
[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:48.660]   available and I would have just kept watching see if all the episodes had been there and I get
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.580]   why they're not because there's a free week trial and you could probably get through all of the
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:57.540]   content and then cancel immediately if you did that but it's it's good enough and it's getting
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:01.860]   better with the opening salvo that I'm curious to see and I don't know if they necessarily have to
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:07.220]   make a lot of money here I think they just have to get their platform going and then use it to
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.260]   again increase the value of the overall Apple ecosystem for people.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:15.780]   Davinjor what do you think I know you care about TV and film what do you think about what Apple's
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:20.340]   doing here I do and I've been following this closely and I was really excited to see like what
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:26.180]   would Apple do differently and turns out kind of kind of nothing like my review title is Apple TV
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:32.420]   Plus is fine and it is like none of the shows are terrible they're all perfectly watchable in
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:38.980]   certain ways but yeah the morning you know the morning hour feels like the newsroom and it feels
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:44.340]   a lot like Aaron Sorkin without Aaron Sorkin as I think the New York Times review had said a lot
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:49.460]   of you all these shows in many ways feel like things we've seen before and it seems like at
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:53.620]   least right now Apple is taking kind of the Netflix approach to some of their content where it's like
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:58.260]   well this is this is okay I guess I'll watch this because it's on a service
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:04.580]   to what Dan was saying I think this is the opening salvo and I feel like launching this thing in
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:09.460]   a hundred countries that's pretty impressive because Disney Plus is only I think going to be
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:15.700]   available in a couple once it launches in November or later this month yeah so the scale of what Apple
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:21.220]   did is impressive showing that they could produce this streaming platform I mean we knew they could
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:25.620]   deliver the stuff because of iTunes and people have been buying that stuff for a while but showing
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:31.380]   that they could produce original content it's more like they prove that they can do it I'm interested
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:38.260]   to see where they go from here especially like that M9 Shyamalan show coming up soon they talked
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:43.380]   about some content coming into next year too nothing seems incredible nothing seems like oh man I
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:48.100]   really have to subscribe to this it does seem like oh this is a nice benefit because I'm an Apple
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:52.580]   customer because I just bought an iPhone or an iPad or something I don't think they're doing this
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:57.540]   for subscription money at all and that's why cost five dollars for sure yeah I wonder about it's
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:03.700]   tough too I just want to say it's tough to because they've also not done the thing that a lot of the
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:09.780]   other competitors have done where it's like let's license you know large existing IP or own existing
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:15.380]   IP right Disney gets to roll out all its Marvel and Star Wars shows and that's a huge way to bring
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:20.260]   people in and you know Netflix obviously had its Marvel shows back in the day and got to use that
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:27.300]   to sort of bolster its original like early on I don't see Apple deciding he wants to play in that
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:31.860]   pool certainly not from corporate partners that are that large it seems to be a very
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:36.260]   Apple way of focusing on let's kind of do this ourselves stem discern and I think that that
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:41.620]   presents potential challenges for them and in terms of them building up their repertoire I think
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.380]   it's still possible that you know a show that comes out next year from them could pick up
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:50.580]   enough buzz to be the the show that drives people to the network right the water cooler show I think
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:55.220]   that's kind of what they're in search of is there not as very Game of Thrones and genre but Game of
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:57:00.100]   Thrones I the show everyone is talking about when it goes on every week that is what they would like
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:04.580]   I just don't think they've necessarily figured out what show that is yet it does feel a little bit
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:10.020]   like these shows were created in a lab oh yeah they're trying to find that they're trying to strike
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:17.940]   gold and I get that but I wonder if you're you're actually never going to do that if you're trying
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:23.380]   for the big hit what you need to do is find some people who are on the verge of superstardom as a
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:29.940]   writer as an actor and you have they have a great idea and it's going to bubble beneath the surface
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.660]   and they're not going to be a thousand stories in the Hollywood Reporter about it but it will be
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.900]   the thing that ends up breaking through just like with Game of Thrones other than people who had read
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:43.700]   those books nobody knew anything about it and the showrunners had never done anything before and
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:50.260]   it became the biggest TV show ever it these all feel like you know let's go to Reese Witherspoon and
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:55.380]   Jennifer Aniston and craft something like the newsroom or let's spend a lot of money on a high concept
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.700]   thing kind of like Game of Thrones and it gives you see and we'll put Jason Momoa in it and okay
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:05.300]   great but they they're coming out of the lab are they really going to be able to just look if you
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:10.500]   could make Game of Thrones in the lab there would be a hundred Game of Throneses and there's only one
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.740]   well they're there are a lot of like as much as I like that you know it is it is let's get
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:19.940]   Ron Moore to do a space show because we like Battlestar Galactica and you know it's it's a
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:24.900]   little bit different but it's like that Renee you were saying no no I was I was agreeing with
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.980]   you completely and I think also they managed to get the big stars by in some ways green lighting
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:32.580]   the vanity projects from their own production companies sure instead of growing them inside
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:38.180]   Apple I mean it's a good mix of both and that the risk is that not all these vanity projects
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:42.180]   with these big stars are going to give you the quality of show that you get from a writer
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:47.060]   producer like Aaron Sorkin or you get from lighting fire to the entire world with the
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:53.140]   drones what Apple hasn't done is make a giant deal with a creator like what you've seen elsewhere
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:59:01.380]   JJ Abrams several other creators that that are Ryan Murphy right all these where they're like
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:05.060]   you have established hits and now we're going to give you a lot of money and again the question is
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:10.660]   are you going to get a new established hit from that or you know or would you be better off
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:17.380]   spending all that money on a bunch of people who are up in comers and Apple I think maybe has just
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:22.820]   been out bid on those I'm not sure that's a strategy because they bid on a people's famously I think
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:27.620]   there's a report that Abrams turned them down even though their bid was higher than you know other
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:32.020]   places where he went to so I'm really interested in like Apple's creative approach to like what
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:35.300]   what were they telling him in terms of like what stories you could tell or what restrictions
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:42.260]   right again put on it yeah and that was a huge their bid was double um yeah warners that was
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:46.660]   he was a little worried about the film he didn't he didn't want to be locked in yeah he wanted him
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:52.100]   doing Apple products yeah Apple products only and he's he was like no no I want to do my own
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:58.340]   stuff and I will say one of the big narratives coming into this launch was Apple you know Tim
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:02.900]   Cook is giving notes Tim Cook is saying you shouldn't really put things on these shows that we can't
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:07.540]   show in an Apple store the most cutting phrase that came up in the entire discussion was that
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:13.380]   what Apple wanted to do was make expensive NBC shows which is a real burn let me tell you
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:20.500]   and I got to say I think that a lot of that came from people who got fired off of shows or were
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:26.260]   disgruntled in some way if you look at the material that's out there there is no shortage of
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:35.300]   edgy material in the Apple TV shows the three man drama's TV ma no it's not family friendly stuff
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:41.060]   entirely I would say five or ten years ago before all these before we had this like
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:45.380]   surf fit of content from all of these different services I think any one of these might have been
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.340]   a show that really caught people's attention but the problem is that the some of the bar is so
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.540]   high we're in the platinum a right the peak TV right there is so much stuff that making something
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:02.180]   stand out really requires it be amazing and I think all of the shows sound like they are good
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:07.860]   solid shows and not every show has or couldn't be the greatest show of all time but I think that
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:13.380]   just because the competition is so fierce nowadays and people are dealing with essentially a lack
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:18.180]   of time right there's only so much TV you can watch especially if you need your time to read
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.940]   Twitter or whatever that you're doing with the rest of your time that like it's you're fighting
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:25.620]   for your fighting for eyeballs a lot and I think that's that means you really got to bring your
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:31.780]   A game and I think this is you know this is B game it's not bad but it's like it's not it's not
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:36.900]   necessarily the thing that's going to win people over to your service yeah it is brutal right I
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:42.100]   mean to Vindra you know it's brutal right now the the amount of content we've got and the quality of
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:47.780]   the content that we've got I think everybody would probably agree the money being spent on TV right
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:53.540]   now is not sustainable it's everybody's spending huge amounts of money on huge amounts of contents
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:59.380]   can be more than 500 original scripted programs in the US this year it was that way last year too
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:04.260]   this it's not sustainable but it's a gold rush right now and you know apple can be part of the
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:09.540]   gold rush but it makes it that much harder for them to break through for sure for sure like it's
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.020]   that is the ultimate problem right now like I've talked to a lot of people like do they would
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:18.020]   they be interested in subscribing to this and they just list the backlog of things they have on
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:23.540]   Amazon and Hulu and other services I do feel like we're getting to a point where we're gonna
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.780]   see some sort of like media bankruptcy where like and not just I'm talking about these companies
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.660]   but I'm talking about like just for people in general HBO Max hadn't yet worried for a while
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:36.660]   they would be a completely separate thing from like HBO now and the whole service but it actually
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:42.020]   sounds more like this is what HBO is gonna evolve into over time so eventually the network will
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:47.540]   just become HBO Max which okay I can understand that Disney Plus they have that entire backlog
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:52.900]   of nostalgia to bank on so that makes sense but then there are other things like NPCs that
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:58.420]   they were talking about and now NBC is reportedly we're poorly thinking of making it free what is
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:03.540]   that peacock yeah it's just gonna be free with ads though see that's that's one of those examples
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:08.820]   where I think they're gonna do the free with ads or and a cable login or something like that because
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:12.980]   being NBC that means they're Comcast which means they want to provide you an incentive to have a
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.380]   cable subscription of some sort you mentioned HBO Max we should talk about that that was the
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.540]   other big news story this week in the streaming wars which is they gave us some clarity it's gonna
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:28.500]   launch in May of 2020 it's gonna cost $14.99 which is essentially what HBO now costs so basically
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.060]   what they're saying is they want you to pay them directly and when you sign up for HBO Max you will
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:39.220]   get all of HBO and more you'll get all the extra catalog stuff and originals that come
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:44.740]   with HBO Max I think the question here is you know they're trying to have it both ways a little bit
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.980]   because like if you just get HBO through your cable provider you won't get HBO Max you're need
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.860]   to need to go get it are you gonna have to cancel HBO I think they want you to take your money away
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:04:01.540]   from your cable company make NBC sad and move it over to AT&T and pay them directly for HBO Max
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:05.300]   it's you know what they're putting a lot of money into it they're giving a lot of thought into the
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:10.100]   way that they're pricing it and branding it I know it's a little bit messy but they've come to play
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:15.620]   as sort of how I take it like this is a they are they are completely recasting what they're doing
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:20.340]   with HBO and they're going all in on this streaming service and you know they're gonna be a serious
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:26.420]   player I think a price point you're so interesting because the the like you said it's the same cost
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:30.580]   as HBO now but you get a lot of stuff on top of that it's the only way they can get away with
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:35.220]   charging essentially what will be I think the most expensive streaming service right like compared to
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.580]   almost all the other ones that are out there I can't think of another one that that's
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:43.060]   just some expensive plans but yeah yeah but you got to get into like the multiple screens
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:47.780]   yeah but still like you know Disney and and Apple are both playing and sort of the
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:53.380]   five to seven dollar range you know who lose in the seven dollar range CBS same and so I mean but
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:58.420]   like people will already pay fifteen dollars for HBO right and if the value proposition is you pay
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:04.340]   that and you just get more stuff then I think that actually wins for them and like you said since
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:09.300]   they are now competing against you know we have these giant mega lithic corporations that are
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:14.820]   essentially fighting because now they're ISPs and cable providers and content producers every
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:20.260]   every bit that AT&T can take away from Comcast is a is a benefit for it so I'm still a little
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.820]   confused about it just because like there's a whole bunch of things where it's like hey if you
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:27.700]   already subscribe subscribe to HBO now you just get HBO Max I'm like all right so I don't have to
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:31.540]   do anything like because I already have that is that is that gonna work unless you're getting it
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:36.660]   through your cable company in which I'm not but yeah you have to or you're getting questions about
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:40.740]   going through Apple to write or Amazon where you can buy channels through them too how does
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:46.660]   it's a little weird the part that still confuses me is it feels like like Warner's always wanted
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.740]   to have multiple channels like you can get the DC channel and the Harry Potter channel and then
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:55.620]   the other Warner channel and you know DC to their sorry Disney to their credit you're going to get
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:02.340]   Marvel Star Wars all of their stuff the Pixar stuff all in one place where I believe HBO
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:07.220]   Warner is going to keep going with the DC channel DCU is a separate thing yeah yeah I will have
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:13.060]   different properties on DC Universe and they'll have DC properties on HBO Max yeah I'm not clear on
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:20.100]   it may be that the DCU stuff that's on video all is also on HBO Max but it's it's very strange and
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:26.340]   I think this is this is how Comcast and AT&T do it to you right is that they they like cloud your
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.180]   mind and you don't know what you're getting where and you pay them three different times in three
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:34.660]   different ways that's I mean that seems to be their their business model almost is you're confused
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:39.140]   and you don't know what to pay and then they just keep taking your money that's I just want to
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:44.100]   control and Aquaman on one service Jason is that really so much to ask you're the only one
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:51.140]   apparently apparently apparently so Dvindra you how do you rate the chances of HBO Max over you
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:55.700]   know getting a getting a foothold in this well I mean they have what they announced another game
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:01.060]   of potential game of thrones series it sounds like the content is interesting that whole HBO
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.780]   library is so valuable to it just seems like it's not something that's really competing with the
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:12.100]   traditional HBO it seems like they're just repositioning how people think of HBO maybe is more of like a
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:18.500]   next Netflix watch instantly service rather than this crazy premium add-on to your cable package
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:25.220]   and there's some value to that for sure so I have more faith in HBO Max for sure I am at least
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:29.700]   interested in things that they were talking about compared to like Apple TV plus where I
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:33.380]   I'm very confused by a lot of it now going back to the international rollout because I think this
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:38.740]   is important and we mentioned it a couple of times this is a us rollout for HBO Max it's not
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:42.340]   really out anywhere else there will be a version in Canada but they're actually licensing it to
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:47.220]   Bell Media in Canada and this is one of those stories that as Renee mentioned before you know
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:52.660]   Apple is doing a hundred percent worldwide launch obviously Amazon is in a lot of countries Netflix
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:58.100]   is now in a lot of countries but the service varies this is one of the challenges with this and
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.820]   I'll throw another piece on on it here this is all about the contracts that they've signed and
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:08.260]   they've sold rights to what what are now competitors and I'll give you the best example and this isn't
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:13.860]   even international this is even in the US who owns the rights to the Harry Potter movies
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:22.820]   well through 2026 it's NBC Universal not Warner Media even though those are Warner Brothers
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:29.300]   movies and that's because like five years ago they sold those rights away what could be the problem
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:35.780]   and they've said that HBO will continue to license using Sky in Europe the Sky Network
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:41.780]   they'll license their content there and I get that they want that money coming in right now
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:46.980]   but you look at these longish term deals with other companies and other parts of the world and
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:51.620]   think you're gonna regret that you're gonna regret that and they're already regretting the Harry Potter
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.260]   thing so I think that the advantage of having the international view like what Apple's doing and
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:01.620]   what Netflix is essentially doing now there's a lot of strength to that when you look at somebody
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:07.780]   like Warner or or CBS is another example where they just can't tear themselves away from
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:13.060]   licensing you know their content to an international partner they're totally Spider-Manned
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:17.540]   I was thinking the same thing it was like yeah you wish Marvel sure wishes they hadn't sold off a
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:22.180]   lot of its rights but they were going down they needed the money yeah they do and now they regret
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.900]   it but CBS is an interesting example here too by the way because they're producing like
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:32.820]   really high quality high-budget shows like Star Trek Discovery looks very expensive I really enjoy
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:37.300]   that show too and they have a card coming up they're doing the Good Fight which is their like
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:42.180]   sequel to The Good Wife which was an amazing show that not many people saw but ran for a long
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:47.380]   time on CBS so like CBS has a lot of quality content I don't know how they're funding that thing
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:51.540]   because I don't know how well it's doing subscriber wise but it is interesting to see them pouring
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:55.220]   money into this Disney is certainly pouring a lot into Disney Plus and Apple into Apple
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:10:02.500]   TV Plus so it's fascinating but I look at Amazon who is producing so many good shows and I try to
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.140]   talk to people about like you know most aren't in the jungle a show that's won Emmys yeah
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:11.460]   and very few people have seen it people haven't heard it people yeah yeah the Marvel
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:16.580]   Swiss mains will people don't know what that is does Amazon have shows or I'm so many of
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:21.220]   us I want to talk about Bosch with somebody you know Dvindra that you mentioned Star Trek
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:26.660]   Discovery the answer of how they're funding that and the former CEO of CBS Les Moonves
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:32.660]   boasted about it they funded Star Trek Discovery by selling it in the rest of the world to Netflix
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:37.540]   that's true and that was great and it was all profitable in North America but they don't own
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:43.620]   the show in the rest of the world and they can't sell it I mean they can't expand CBS all access
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:49.860]   with their flagship show and this is the that's the challenge I will say everybody who knows
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:55.700]   and watches this business looks at CBS and says you know if Apple ever did want to buy
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:00.500]   an entertainment conglomerate oh yeah it's all with whole they're the ones yeah but whether Apple
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:06.740]   wants to own Star Trek or not I don't know it would be two of my lifelong brand relationships in one
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:11.300]   place that's weird it's weird anyway I don't want to talk about it we should uh we should move on
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:17.300]   let's take a break and let Leo send you a message and then we will get back with more
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:23.380]   in just a minute so I'm on vacation right now I'm not I'm but I came back to do these ads because
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:28.340]   I sleep on a Casper and I can tell you right now I love vacation but what I do what I miss
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:34.580]   is home and most of all I miss my Casper mattress is it the best part about vacation
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:38.020]   maybe not the best part but it's a great part when you when it's over and you go home and you get
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:42.820]   to sleep in your own bed such it's so nice and honestly traveling the world makes you really
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:49.380]   appreciate home sweet home my home sweet home is that much sweeter because of Casper I love
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:54.980]   my Casper mattresses Casper of course we've talked about them before they're an online retailer
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.700]   of premium mattresses but they're a fraction of the cost because there's no middleman there's no
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:06.580]   store marking it up 100% Casper sells not just mattresses bedding bed frames even a glow light
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:11.620]   that's so awesome help you fall asleep that I do travel with Casper has everything you need
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:18.260]   to create the perfect sleep environment and sleep is so important do not you know think
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:24.260]   while I'm unconscious it doesn't matter it does now just the other day I got the new Casper hybrid
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:28.980]   mattress this is part of a new collection from Casper it combines the pressure relief of their
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:35.700]   award-winning foam which I'm a big fan of but then they add back the durable yet gentle springs and
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:43.220]   I have to say I think this is a really nice mattress because you get absolute comfort
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:49.780]   resilient support it's kind of an elevated lift which I actually prefer it gives you active support
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:57.460]   and durability so you know your bumpy bits are nicely supported it's very much more comfortable
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:02.340]   the spring network keeps the airflow enhanced which is really nice because you want to sleep
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:09.220]   cool that's where side has no that really is the best way to sleep and then honestly the thing I
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:14.180]   really like enhanced edge support it's easier to get out of the bed because it doesn't collapse
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:20.180]   under your weight I think that's huge a firmer perimeter everybody ought to have a firmer
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:27.220]   perimeter don't you think I think so I love my new Casper mattress it's so soft it's so comfortable
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:33.940]   it's got a firmer perimeter when where can I say Casper it does free delivery painless returns in
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:38.020]   the u.s. and canada and the thing is they know you're not trying to the store so they give you
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:44.580]   and I think this is the best thing ever a 100 night risk-free sleep on a trial if at any time
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:49.460]   in that hundred nights you don't like it you call them up they take it refund every penny you don't
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:54.660]   have to box it up or anything yes they still come even with the springs in that really come back box

[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:43.220]   relay FM podcast network called download for about a year and one of the things that I noticed
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:49.140]   was every single week we had a story about something terrible that Facebook had done
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:58.660]   to vendor get ready here we go oh social media let's talk about it twitter said this week that
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:05.140]   they have a solution to all of the problems with misleading political ads verifying whether
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:12.580]   claims are true or not are they foreign governments trying to control elections they said what if
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:20.020]   we just don't do political ads anymore how about that maybe Jack came up with this while he was
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:25.780]   meditating I don't know probably yeah meanwhile his one bit of insight for meditation yeah
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:31.220]   meanwhile Mark Zuckerberg you know just guess what do you think Mark Zuckerberg did he say
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:35.780]   that's a good idea you know we've got all the money our latest results came out Facebook makes
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:40.180]   all the money and political ads are a small part of what we do so yeah this is an interesting
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:48.820]   solution what if we just no he said I think they're great yeah they're great we love political ads
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:52.900]   and he ended up getting a letter from some Facebook employees saying that they were really
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:16:00.420]   troubled by this stance but guess what Facebook not going to turn away that sweet sweet money
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:05.220]   and political ads whether they may be misleading or not are going to be a part of that interesting
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:09.620]   contrast though between Twitter and Facebook and their approach to this which is kind of
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:17.620]   like touching on the third rail of regulation in social media so I want to start with divindra
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.220]   because I know we've talked about terrible things Facebook's done in the past sure what do you think
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:26.660]   about about this whole issue Twitter Facebook and political ads not surprise at all that
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:32.100]   Zuckerberg is kind of digging in his heels here because this has been the company's mindset for a
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:37.460]   while now even though like yeah we've pointed to a lot of things related to political advertising
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:43.780]   and political messaging on Facebook and how they're unprepared to handle it and you know they're
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:48.900]   unprepared to even like yeah just deal with any of that information I think Twitter's solution
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:55.060]   is probably the best one because it's it's really hard for any of these companies to police these
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:17:02.260]   ads to really verify them and at the end of the day like the greater harm I know on a societal level
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:07.220]   is like letting bad false information ads out there at least we know Zuckerberg thinks the
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:14.260]   lying is bad right that was his response AOC I think lying is bad that's his big insight so
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:21.940]   there you go you went to Harvard I mean he knows things man I man it's the competition to see
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:27.620]   who is slightly less of a trash fire in the social media world and I don't know the problem
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:33.620]   with this is going to be is this going to be like the way that Twitter already sort of moderates
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:40.100]   like you know hate speech which is to say ineffectually they can they can talk a good game about it and
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:45.060]   I think I agree with the vendor that it's it seems like the right approach but there's a lot of
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:50.020]   nuance and a lot of question about exactly how this is going to get enforced and there's also a
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:55.700]   lot of questions about how do you enforce things that might be ads not from political candidates
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:01.300]   but touch upon political issues what constitutes a political issue because lots of stuff is political
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:07.140]   I mean you know your your opinion on encryption could be a political if you're paying for an ad on
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:12.500]   that like there's there's just a lot of question about enforcement and how exactly they're going
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:18.500]   to handle that and I think I'm not sure you know I'm not willing to attribute you know Jack Dorsey's
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:24.660]   motivation here to any sort of altruism or goodness of his heart I think he probably just wants to
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:29.140]   avoid having to deal with the problems that Mark Zuckerberg is having to avoid and I think that's
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:33.540]   make the pain stop I don't think it's going to work for him I gotta be honest I think they're
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:37.860]   just going to find themselves embroiled in a huge controversy over what constitutes a political ad
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.500]   and they're going to do a bad job of making decisions there's also an argument to be made that
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:47.860]   if you say no politics what you're really saying is if you're something somebody who's advocating
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:52.020]   for something entrenched if you're a big corporation and you say this is great because it's our company
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:57.380]   and we're marketing it if somebody wants to take out an ad and say no what this company is doing is
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:03.860]   bad that is a political statement and so that this policy will sort of reinforce the status quo it's
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.420]   definitely one of the one of the arguments here I don't ever assume that Facebook is going to do
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:13.140]   the right thing although this is a very complicated issue you know the problem is Facebook's track
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:18.340]   record right like I I have a hard time taking Mark Zuckerberg seriously when he says anything at
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:23.300]   this point because we have seen time and again that Facebook says one thing and then does another
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:29.540]   and knows they'll just have to apologize and pay a small fine probably after the fact and that's not
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:34.100]   you know so it's it's hard for me to as we're entering another election cycle here in the US
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:38.660]   like to believe that this isn't going to continue to be an enormous story in that face what is not
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:44.180]   prepared to deal with it what if Mark Zuckerberg saying lying is bad was a lie that's like a whole
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:49.860]   one truth one lie like that's impossible because as an android it would make his head explode
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:53.780]   yes the that's a Captain Kirk logic conundrum that would happen there
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:20:00.100]   by the way also this week Facebook launched a tool that you give it your age and gender and it
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:05.860]   provides you with preventative health care info what could go wrong with giving more information
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:10.260]   let's be let's face it they already know everything about you so maybe they could tell you to
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:14.900]   well they offered walk a little fight they offered to let you upload all your nude pictures to them
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:18.180]   and then they'd make sure no one else could ever post them these are the kind of ideas that come
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:23.780]   out of that organization they're using their brains there's because they're smart it's they're smart
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:30.900]   let's move on i want to talk about the fires and the blackouts in california if you have followed
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:36.820]   twit at all you probably know about it the county in which the twit studios reside reside has been
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:42.900]   severely affected by both lots of blackouts lots of fires there is a tech angle here a couple
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:49.300]   of things first off a good story that the new york times ran about the interesting aspect of the
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:55.460]   california blackouts and i felt this i was prepared for a long blackout at my house we did have one
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:02.020]   we had a three-day blackout but what i wasn't prepared for is the fact that all the cell towers
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:08.420]   went down and beforehand the cell carriers said no no no we've got backups we've got generators
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:14.180]   we're going to wire this up it's all going to be good and um i think something like 60 percent or
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:22.020]   70 percent of the cell towers in my county went down for three days along with the rest of the power
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:27.620]   and there are a lot of challenges here when you've got wildfires spreading and your plan is to alert
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:34.900]   people via the the cellular phone emergency alerts but people don't have service if you've got people
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:40.660]   who are expected to my wife is a municipal employee and they were communicating via text about how
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:45.940]   to provide support for the city during the emergency she didn't get the text for a day and a half
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:50.420]   because we didn't have service and when we did have service the service was so spotty that
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:55.860]   apparently the text just sort of queued up and didn't get sent out until a day later and
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:00.340]   i just i think this is a really interesting angle because when we think about power outages we
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:03.700]   think about well i'll just charge my phone and i'll have a backup battery and i'll be okay
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:09.940]   and then you live through it and you realize that it doesn't you know if the data is not there it
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:14.340]   doesn't matter that you've got a cell phone in your hand that's perfectly charged because you can't
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:18.980]   i mean you could like crack a walnut with it i suppose but you can't do anything with it because
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:24.020]   the data is down we all ended up at a local supermarket which had the foresight to bring in an
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:30.100]   enormous generator and somehow had uh had internet i don't even know how but they had wifi and that
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:34.580]   was the only way that we got out to the world was walking a few times a day over to the supermarket
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:40.740]   and checking in um it's a good story you guys are all uh not in a place that at least yet has
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:45.700]   been affected by major blackouts but you know what do you think about this the coupling of uh of
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:49.380]   uh losing your internet with losing your power it's the it's a one two punch let me tell you
[01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:55.060]   we had that before that before the cellular networks became popular we had that famous infamous ice
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:23:00.740]   storm in the late 1990s that took out power for a week or two and we just you know you lost television
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:05.060]   but that was the most you lost but just this week we had 106 kilometer an hour wind and it was
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:10.740]   knocking down trees and even though we we lose power every year when the ice storms i think only
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:15.860]   one borough on the entire island has has put their power cables underground and we have relatively
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:20.260]   good cell phone coverage but a lot of them are towers that are on the tops of buildings or churches
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:24.420]   or or other things and they're they are really susceptible to that kind of environmental damage
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:29.220]   and impact and it doesn't seem and i think a lot of other countries have made fun of north america
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:33.220]   of this but doesn't seem that we really intent on hardening our infrastructure against natural
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:39.540]   disasters in any meaningful way yeah we really strange are a complete infrastructure failure
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:45.220]   right like i think that's the main thing in new york we had hurricane sandy um or a super storm sandy
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:50.580]   in 2012 and the city flooded and honestly a lot of things kept going it was mainly like the subway
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:55.380]   systems do have to say Jason my hark was out to you and everybody else in california like this
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:24:00.500]   reading about this stuff is terrifying because it seems like you guys are on the front lines of like
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:06.660]   the critical infrastructure or failure that the rest of the world is going to end up seeing uh power
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:11.140]   going out as one thing like that alone is the tech angle the fact that pg and e is such a uh
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:16.180]   yeah terrible company that they can probably do this like this seems criminal this seems
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:21.780]   absolutely insane i don't think our current presidential administration has said much
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:27.220]   about the california fires like half a yeah a major coast is on fire here and we're not hearing
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:32.500]   much or hearing much about like what the government's gonna do to fix this it's a sad state of affairs
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:37.060]   like the world is literally on fire um the people in charge aren't doing about anything about it and
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:42.740]   the people who are supposed to watch them don't really seem to care so it is the worst scenario
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.380]   in all respects i hope we figure out some sort of solutions here it does sort of speak to our
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:52.180]   complacency right like you know especially in the u.s where we tend to tout like well you know we're
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.900]   developed nation and we spend you know we have the most advanced technology we have all the best
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:25:02.740]   stuff and it's like well yeah but we haven't we we got sort of sat at like comfortable sitting on
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.340]   our laurels thinking we've done a great job of building out all this stuff and it turns out it's
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.260]   not very robust uh and you could say the same thing about other infrastructure points like you
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:14.500]   know bridges and roads and stuff like that too but obviously from a tech angle you know your power
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:20.020]   grid your data network all of that is really critical and and certainly you know it's funny
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:23.700]   because we moved away from landlines but obviously like that was the thing i remember as a kid when
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:27.540]   the power went out like you lost power but you can still make phone calls because you know
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:32.100]   my didn't depend on power yeah uh obviously not nothing now i had a brilliant thought because i
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:37.140]   have a uh ups i have two ups is at home which is great if you're power flickers or not you get this
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:41.220]   uninterruptible power supply it's like a big power strip with a battery plug it into your
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:45.380]   computer your computer stays up at least long enough to save and shut down and copy your files
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:49.300]   wherever you need to copy them that sort of thing and i had these i was like you know what i can do
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:54.500]   is i can take a Wi-Fi base station and my cable modem pop them on the ups turn it on and i can get
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:59.940]   back on the internet well guess what Comcast was out because they whatever thing was providing
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:04.660]   internet also lost power and they didn't have a backup and this is if i learned a lesson from
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:10.580]   this round of blackouts it was that there's this whole secondary infrastructure that relies on
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:16.020]   the power infrastructure and while as this new york times story said they gave a lot of reassurances
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:22.500]   beforehand these tenders of the secondary infrastructure that they had a plan they did not have a plan
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:27.140]   and so the cell towers they said oh no we've got generators they didn't or they didn't work or they
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:33.220]   didn't have them for long enough for it to matter and uh Comcast internet is a good example like
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:37.140]   they didn't have a backup so even if you did have a battery backup for your cable modem you
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:44.820]   couldn't get on the internet and and uh yes if i had had a landline i wonder if my atnt landline
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:50.500]   would have been active i switched to a cable landline so i didn't get that but this is i think a lesson
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:56.580]   learned here um there is a large of life bones everybody yeah there's a larger lesson here about
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:02.500]   infrastructure and paying for infrastructure upgrades and the fact that by the way the power
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:07.860]   shutdowns in california happened to prevent more fires because many of the largest fires were started
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:14.260]   by wind blowing on transmission lines or towers and sparking them and the sparks then get blown
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:19.300]   into the trees and then the wind whips that into an enormous forest fire of course there are at least
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:27.460]   two and perhaps more major fires in northern california this year who despite the power shut offs were
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:33.380]   caused by pge and eve of power companies uh towers still being active in some areas so
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:37.540]   despite all the shutdowns it still didn't solve the problem of the fires although maybe there
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:42.020]   would have been many more had they kept the power on it's just it's a lesson to be learned and i
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:48.180]   think if you're horizon and t-mobile and atnt and Comcast you have to look at this and say
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:55.620]   oh right we can't count on the power company to do its job to let us serve our customers and we
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:28:00.340]   need to do something else about it and a lot of it is just a big corporations and big agencies
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:03.700]   kicking the can down the road a lot of times they think well everything works fine right now why
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:07.220]   do we have to invest money in making sure that it works fine over the long term and you can see
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:12.100]   this in in a number of places from utilities to public transit to other infrastructure stuff
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:16.580]   people think everything being fine right now is an indication that it will continue to be fine
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.620]   and the answer is no that's not how it works there's there's a crazy existential dilemma
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:25.540]   happening here because of all this because it shows us like yeah civilization as we know it
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:30.740]   could just like stop working very quickly if like yeah these critical bits of infrastructure
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:37.300]   just start failing it it seems like they could at any point at this point yeah yeah it was my
[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:42.260]   confidence of having enough batteries to get me through a multi-day it was like yeah great and I
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:46.340]   did and then the internet went out and we were you know kind of wandering through streets that
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:50.580]   were completely empty and all the businesses were shut down and all the gas stations were closed
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:56.340]   and empty and you know the whole foods was working well great okay buy yourself some pink butter
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:01.140]   that's great but I did have that feeling with the failure of the secondary infrastructure I started
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:06.100]   to feel a little bit of exactly what you said to Vindra which is there you know you strip away a
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:14.180]   couple layers of infrastructure and you start to get a sense of how thin the veneer and the
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:18.260]   fact that there's there was absolutely nothing you could do about that right like you can't control
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:23.460]   the cell phone towers like you can't control your ISP you can have all the best like you said you
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:28.900]   can stock up on the batteries you can have all your food and coolers or whatever but you can't do
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.140]   anything about the rest of the infrastructure not doing their job so you know they add to that the
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:37.540]   feeling of powerlessness when it's like well I did all the right things I took all the correct steps
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:43.380]   to be prepared this is no longer my problem but it is influencing me somehow nonetheless yeah and
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:48.580]   yeah and I thought about bugging out to San Francisco which did have power and we got on the freeway
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:52.660]   and it was going to be bumper to bumper all the way into San Francisco because everybody else
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:57.380]   had the same idea same idea so we just got off and went back home and like the end of every disaster
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:02.980]   movie right like that plane we're trying to escape basically turn off the car you know leave it on
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:08.020]   the road in the middle of the road just continue to walk like every zombie movie ever in the in the
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:13.540]   in the red ones yeah I will say I also I feel bad like people who even have solar panels on their
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:19.700]   homes who thought like they were okay unless you had a home battery pack like the the Tesla power
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:25.140]   thing like you can't use those cells because you're just pumping power back into the into the grid
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:29.060]   so it's like there's there's a whole other level going on here even people who thought they were
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:33.060]   prepared probably aren't as much as they thought. Dan and I have a friend yes right I thought
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:38.980]   you're gonna say our friend Lex has solar panels on his house during sandy in New Jersey and the
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:43.460]   power went out for more than a week I think maybe it was like 10 days 12 days and even though they
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:46.180]   have a solar panel they didn't yeah they didn't have the inverter and they didn't have a cutoff and
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:50.500]   they didn't have all the things that you need to route so even in the daytime they didn't have power
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:55.620]   let alone a battery system and that is you know I called all the solar companies this week and said
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:01.380]   I would like solar panels and a battery because you know I don't want to do that again and I would
[01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:06.500]   like to be able to take that level of control over my over my life but of course it's not going to
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:11.540]   solve the other infrastructure issues including the internet and you know if I can get to a gas
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:17.540]   station or whatever else it's just interesting times we live in interesting times I want to
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:25.780]   have a positive tech angle here too a couple amazing tools in outer space that that came into
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:31.780]   play during these events these last few weeks the National Weather Service tweeted something from
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:38.180]   the GOES satellite it's an infrared map of the big fire the kinkade fire as it was in progress
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:45.140]   it's an amazing you know animated gif of yes I said gif you heard me of the infrared of the fire
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:49.940]   as it spread overnight and you can see it they used to have sort of fire spotters and towers and
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:54.980]   things like that or flying planes over it but now we have infrared cameras in space with incredibly
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:32:00.740]   high resolution and if you're watching the video version of the show the the animation is pretty
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:05.060]   remarkable you can see the spikes in temperature and you can see the fire moving as it burns through
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:10.820]   areas into other areas it's pretty crazy and also the National Weather Service and this is a sign
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:16.660]   of the times if ever there was one is building a computer model that is a different kind of
[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:24.340]   weather computer model this is a smoke drift model for places affected by fires to see where the
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:29.220]   smoke will be so that they can predict when unhealthy air will hit various regions because
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:34.180]   smoke plumes can travel over very long distances and so they plugged the smoke information and
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:37.860]   all of their atmospheric information into a weather model but rather than trying to predict the
[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:43.140]   weather they're just trying to predict where the smoke will go and what the air quality is and
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:48.980]   it's a it's a work in progress it's experimental right now but I think it shows you that a year or
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:54.020]   two ago when these fires really started to kick in they said you know what we could do a better job
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:59.540]   of trying to predict when people need to stay inside um sign of the times in October and November
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:06.180]   in California for sure um we have a little more to talk about we have some emoji business to get
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:12.820]   down to but uh first a lot of things happened throughout the twit network this week and uh we
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:20.660]   made a little movie to show you what went on previously on twit Friday night around 7 30
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:27.300]   east coast time I started seeing people tweeting Microsoft won the Jedi contract
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:32.100]   the department of their cover robots uh that we're gonna inflict on our enemies um they're using
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:38.820]   Microsoft AI actually they're using Cortana and uh it's gonna be a win this week in google I got

[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:17.780]   that's one thing i like about stamps.com normally if you have something more i think what is the limit
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:22.020]   a pound you can't put it in the mailbox you they have to make you bring it to the post office
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:29.060]   not with stamps.com no because of that you know trademarked indicia on there they look at it
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:35.380]   and they go oh yeah we know that is that's fine that's cool we get with stamps.com you get five cents
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:41.940]   of every first class stamp okay post office won't do that 40 percent off priority mail

[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:52.980]   one of their competitors was bit by ransomware a lot of people couldn't use the postage meters

[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:16.820]   but it's also emoji season that's what happens when the leaves fall right like the emojis just
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:24.980]   leave emojis are yeah extruded and fire emojis are extinguished the uh ios update that just came out
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:31.140]   enables a whole bunch of new emoji that were part of the Unicode consortiums 2019 emoji release
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:36.180]   meaning that now the two major mobile platforms support these new emoji people actually update
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:43.220]   their iPhones to get the new emoji there are lots and lots of them you can always go to emoji
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:50.020]   pedia.org run by our good friend Jeremy Burge and you can find out about every emoji imaginable
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:56.020]   and their blog has lots of great details about it there's also a really nice story that i found on
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:40:04.340]   the verge by jpeters if you've ever said to yourself i wish there was an emoji for blank it's a great
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:12.980]   story to read jpeters made a uh a couple of proposals for a waffle emoji and for a yawning person emoji
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:18.980]   and this week he's been enjoying seeing famous people tweet out things about the yawning face emoji
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:24.900]   imagine that you do a long text thread and uh sort of like how i'm talking now and then the response is
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:31.140]   yawn emoji like oh i talked a little bit too young too long i will also recommend to people if you
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:37.300]   like podcasts uh go to the welcome to mac and tosh podcast mark bram hill did a great four-part series
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:45.380]   about getting an emoji a particular emoji uh created and approved and the bureaucratic process that
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:50.020]   goes into it it is fascinating these emoji don't just kind of happen on the spur of the moment there's a
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:56.020]   whole process and one of the big things that happened in this emoji season is gender neutral emoji
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:41:01.380]   for emoji that used to default to a gender and you know you can't say the word gender without it being
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:06.580]   a controversy but this is actually something that google added and apple added in fact as
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:13.380]   emoji pedia reported the timeline for this was actually more like 2020 but google and apple both
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:20.260]   jumped on board faster with this and the idea is if you wanted to pick a vampire or an astronaut
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:27.220]   and the gender that was the default was not yours then you need to go oh i need male vampire or
[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:33.700]   female astronaut and what has happened is that they are uh they are trying to remove a specific
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:41.220]   gender and have the uh the defaults the the non-specific gender be a uh a non-gendered image
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:45.780]   obviously a lot of controversy there but uh kind of makes sense if you've ever personally as
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:50.420]   somebody who doesn't have a mustache i never used the male astronaut emoji because he had a mustache
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:54.500]   she looked like michael colons in a powell 11 and i don't have a mustache and i don't identify
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:59.780]   with that astronaut and i can use the regular generic astronaut now and uh and feel better about
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:07.460]   the fact that i shave my my face uh emoji it's so uh you know so controversial and yet we use it to
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:13.460]   to communicate any any uh any opinions about emoji i i don't even know where to go here if you were
[01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:21.700]   an emoji would you not bitmoji yeah yay emoji no bitmoji god i'm with you i'm with you i my
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:26.180]   mica sergeant who we just saw there who was my co-host over a clockwise will be he will he will be
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:31.540]   clutching his chesty no i think Renee's a bit of a bitmoji person too i like bitmoji me moji all
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:38.500]   emoji any moji i'm a fan bitmoji are not emoji there's something else something terrible they're bad
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:43.540]   drawings i mean i think i think what i take away from this is i mean it's a funny story but at the
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:48.820]   same time like and i get that people get worked up about this stuff because it emoji man it it
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:54.580]   matters to people but it doesn't happen on the spur of the moment the the blame game is amazing
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:59.460]   for this because sometimes the platforms get blamed sometimes the Unicode gets blamed um it's
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:04.500]   actually kind of a partnership Unicode doesn't make the art the art on each platform is different and
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:10.340]   it's commissioned by the platform owners which is why your emoji look weird on in gmail and they
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:14.980]   look weird on twitter because they use different emoji sets then if it's running on an app on your
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:20.500]   phone or your computer um and you know after the Unicode consortium approves it the the platform
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:25.700]   owners have to implement it which is and sometimes get ahead of the the consortium like with uh going
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:30.660]   to gender neutral defaults and then letting you specify a gender if you want to that's something
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:35.780]   that that obviously whoever was assigning the art department at apple and google they
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:39.620]   they already knew that they wanted to do this and so they just pushed ahead with it even before
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:43.780]   the Unicode that's just orange in though right like at like uh askey are at like the aske emoji
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.300]   the winky face those were never gendered in the early smiley faces those were never gendered
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:51.620]   like this is getting back to the roots of emoji where they could literally represent all of us
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:56.500]   to all of us without any of the sort of baggage that we pile up on top of everything else i'm glad
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:00.500]   they're they're empowering us again that way yeah i'm the idea that that if you have a fireman and
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:06.420]   it's always a man and then a woman wants to express firemen and she can't say a woman with or even
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:11.380]   when they add the female firefighter if the default firefighter is a man that does say something and
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:16.660]   so now it's sort of like you get a a less gendered firefighter and then you get to choose that's
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:22.980]   another thing that that so knowing jeremy berg at a at emoji pewdie a jeremy berg uh gets all the hate
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:28.980]   about every emoji change that happens it's amazing um and he keeps making the point which is they
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:34.420]   are not removing any emoji right it's not like emoji the emoji people came out and said no
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:38.900]   firefighters have genders anymore what they said was we're going to do a default where there isn't
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:43.860]   facial hair and there isn't long hair or super you know masculine features or feminine features
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:48.820]   and then you can also choose male firefighter or female firefighter you get all the choices this
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:54.420]   there are more choices than there were before so you know it's it's just trying to be more inclusive
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:59.220]   and and you can still use you can still represent yourself but maybe other people who didn't feel
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:04.500]   represented are also represented now that's a good thing yeah it's it seems like a huge i i don't see
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:10.100]   any downside here personally like it seems like a kind of choice i agree with uh with rene's point
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:14.820]   that like you know we kind of started with very gender neutral stuff even the most of the emoji
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:20.180]   that i use nowadays are some variety of the you know just yellow smiley face and i always felt like
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:24.180]   it's pretty broad you know it kind of reminds me like legos like classic legos where it could
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:29.220]   you know just kind of be anything because it was just a smiley face but you know like you said
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:32.660]   people use it a lot and people have strong feelings about it you cast your mind back a few years
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:39.380]   ago when apple changed the gun to a water pistol and there was a lot of arguments about that as
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:45.140]   well because people felt very strongly about it had opinions one direction or the other um and you
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:50.180]   know people surprising everybody people really like to argue about things it's really like getting
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:55.140]   mad about things i know that's that's news to a lot of people but now i can tell you the most
[01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:59.780]   offensive thing that just happened which is the waffle emoji as interpreted by apple it's around
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:04.740]   waffle come on apple what are you doing what are you doing lego should be a triangle everybody
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:10.900]   waffles are square waffles are square i'm outraged i cannot i know my waffle line is round two so i don't
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:17.860]   know it's the ego it's big ego wow exactly exactly i was rolling on i really enjoy the uh the cat face
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:25.540]   emojis i want more animal face emojis those are always the next square pancakes that's right uh
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:32.580]   anyway it's it's emoji are more complicated than you might think um also just added to the lineup and
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:38.020]   i i didn't even know this apparently facebook has uh it does not want you sending the eggplant or
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:48.740]   the peach emoji anymore i didn't see that coming day yeah totally if they are used in a sexual manner
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:52.740]   how do they know do they have some sophisticated machine learning that is determining how you use
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:57.140]   the peach emoji is that okay though you cannot use the eggplant you cannot use the peach you can't use
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:04.420]   water drips in a in a in a sexual manner well that's 11 but how do they know how do they know
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:09.780]   who is who is in charge of that whose job is that because that is i just i would still just love to
[01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:14.420]   be able to long press the french fries and get poutine and tater tots just give me that
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:19.220]   wow you're gonna need to this is what you need is the next generation emoji where it's like you
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:25.620]   start combining the emoji it's like well if i put the potato emoji in the oven emoji it renders french
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:31.780]   dry emoji it's like shortcuts but for emoji yeah shortcut for emoji that's terrifying actually
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:37.460]   you know facebook's uh facebook's heart is in the right place right protect against bad emojis
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:44.260]   keep lying political ads no yes let's keep that go no emoji is bad they're fundamentally they're
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:51.700]   just used it's like says words come on who doesn't like a peach or an eggplant for that matter
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:57.140]   part emojis in the wrong place though anyway emoji there's a huge emoji bureaucracy big emoji is what
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:02.820]   i'm saying but but if you could write a boring paper explaining why something should be an emoji you
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:08.580]   can submit it to Unicode and maybe even go and and stake your case and you could get a famous
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:14.020]   rapper to tweet about your emoji someday that sounds great yeah that'd be the american dream so just
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:19.540]   uh imagine it but now that there's a taco emoji i'm good so i'm fine it's all it's all good all right
