[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.880]   It's time for Twit. This week in tech, our weekly tech news roundtable we bring in
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.520]   my favorite people. Every week it's my favorite people. People might think that's inconsistent
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.280]   but you're all my favorite people. I love Ian Thompson from the register, not the register.co.uk
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.160]   the register.com. Wow, that's a lot. We've got big boy pants now.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.120]   You still look a little bit like James Bond but that's okay.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.720]   Actually you most more like who is a Terry, the guy with the gaff teeth.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   Terry Thomas. Terry Thomas. Ding.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.280]   Exactly. My point exactly. Also when drunk turning into a very drunk Terry Thomas on a
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   couple of occasions. So yes that's a bit. If you put a little gap between your teeth,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.640]   only people my age would recognize it but it would be pretty good. I'm just.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:55.040]   Oh rather. Terry Thomas. And also with us from Microsoft. Filmgirl is here. Christina Warren's.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.400]   Good to see you senior cloud advocate at Microsoft. Good to hear.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:06.640]   Hey. Different camera today. I'm liking it. Yes. Yes. I'm using, you know, with that's all having
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.600]   to work from home and whatnot. I bought a more expensive, you know, mirrorless camera than I needed
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.520]   and have been doing the whole cam link. It really looks good. But yeah, I like it.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.960]   Super clear. Really nice. What camera? This is the Sony A6400.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.680]   You didn't get Sony has a new vlogger camera. You get that.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.960]   I know and I was annoyed, right? Because the reason I bought this one was because my RX100
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:39.360]   mark 5A. I do too. Here's the problem. The 5A will shut off if it's on, even if it's not recording
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.480]   for like more than five or six minutes. And so I couldn't use it as like an actual camera,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.320]   even though it would have been perfect. And I'm annoyed because I spent like $1,000 on that
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.920]   camera like 18 months ago. So I was, I was pretty annoyed that I was like, I'm going to have to buy
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.680]   another camera. And of course I buy the A6400 because I could have gotten something less
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.720]   expensive, but I just went for it. And then like literally within a month of me buying it,
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.400]   they can own the new vlogger camera, which would have been perfect because it would have been small.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.240]   And anyway, I just got a nice little dead cat on top of it.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.880]   Yeah, I mean, I can do that on this one too. It's just so much bigger. So what I'm probably
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.680]   going to do is try to sell my my mark 5A and maybe get the maybe get the vlogger camera and just use
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.760]   this one for at home. Are you using special lighting of any kind? Because the lighting is
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.600]   also really good. Yeah, so I do have a couple of Elgato key lights, but right now this is actually
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.160]   just I know I got really lucky. I was able to get both the cam link and the key lights before
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   they were completely unavailable. So but I'm actually right now, I don't even have them on.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.520]   This is just this is just Seattle. Oh, it's just Seattle. Seattle has a soft box nine days out of 10,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.600]   right? So also, why are we talking photography? We should introduce and pro at our photographer,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.880]   host of hands on photography. Hello, and good to see you. Hello. Hello, Mr. Le Porte. Hello,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.680]   Miss Miss Warren and Mr. Thompson actually, and using a pretty good camera for his video too,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.480]   using that camera you and I saw at CES in in in in two hundred. Were we actually it's
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.160]   it's January. It was in January. We got different worlds. Go big. We traveled. We got an airplane.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:34.640]   I was wild. Yeah, that's the M200 is really a good camera. And that's that is also you can get
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.840]   the two things you need. One in which Christina was experiencing, which is the cameras can stay on
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.360]   and doesn't turn itself off automatically. For what I do for that is we get these little dummy
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.040]   batteries that actually plug into a power supply. Yeah, that's what I'm actually using with mine
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.360]   right now. Because if it thinks it's a battery, but it never stops, it's perfect. And then the
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.800]   other is a clean you need clean HDMI out. And that's exactly what this M200 does is really good looking
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.920]   camera. That's a nice light into it. Oh my goodness. It shines. Are you going to review the Z the ZV1,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.800]   the new vlogging camera for us? I would love to. So maybe I'll buy it. Maybe I'll just buy it. And
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.400]   that's for review purposes. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, right. Right. Right. Right. And it's for review
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:30.080]   purposes. Miss Le Porte is listening, right? Yeah. Honey. Actually, what I like about this is it
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.400]   comes with this grip. So I mean, they really me serious when they say it's for vlogging because the
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.960]   the grip, you don't hold the camera, you hold the grip and then it has a button on it to shoot or
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.240]   to I think that's a very cool, I guess I'll have to get that too. Or does it come? I remember when
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:54.480]   that was announced and I remember seeing Miss Warren's tweet about you knew you knew she was she was
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:03.920]   very very happy. I'll just say that. Yeah. Yeah. I was wanting to be a vlogger someday. Maybe I'll
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:10.320]   be a vlogger or an influencer. Wouldn't that even be good? What are we influencers doing in the in
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.480]   the COVID? Should we not have their houses? Yeah, they can't get outside. And then it's and then of
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:24.880]   course, you know, after George Floyd, you can't just be like, Lottie, I'm oh, look how my swimming pool
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:32.320]   matches my tan. You have to whatever. You have to be serious. So it's got to be tough. I feel for
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.120]   all right, tough for influencers. Well, a lot of the influencers stuff started to come off as
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   adult show and tell. Yeah, phony. And I never really cared for that. There are some influences
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.440]   out there that I highly respect because they are skilled and they don't just do it for the paycheck
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.280]   to actually, you know, get paid on the things that they actually support. You know, it's not just
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.160]   show and tell respect. You're an influencer, Renee Richie's an influencer. That's different.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   That's like a legit influencer. That's not right. You know, Kim Kardashian. That's something different.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   If someone just someone paid me money to put a picture of this on my Instagram feed, it's just,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:17.040]   I think people are getting tired of that really quickly. And it's about time to quite frankly.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:25.120]   In honor of the new register.com, I think this whole first section should be just from the
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.400]   register today. Oh, grief. There's no pressure.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:41.520]   There's a couple of stories I just love like this guy. I have this general electric refrigerator.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:52.480]   It has a filter in it that requires a chip for copy protection. It's a copy protection chip.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.640]   They brought the printer. Yes. To the French. I love it. I hate it.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.000]   Well, you can get it too. You can get a physical filter that fits it for $13.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.360]   The general electric part is $50 that's so irritated. Some guy that he's created.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.160]   Go filter gate.com.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.640]   Oh, my God.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.040]   You said you're going to be with this.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.240]   You can filter gate.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.040]   Good. Oh, I want to call it go filter gate. All right.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:28.640]   Okay. I thought it was like a filter fish. Go filter gate. So he's basically hacked it
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:35.040]   so that he is awesome. He has a different. You can go through him instead of GE
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.760]   and use your own third party cheap filter instead of the special filter.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.080]   I mean, this is going to become much more much more common because companies are quite frankly
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.480]   taking the piss. I mean, there's already a massive market in the farming community for
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:57.680]   1970s and 80s farming equipment, which doesn't have all the proprietary software and the chips.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.840]   And you don't have to get a dealer out to fix it. You can take a spanner and do it yourself.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.760]   It's a great Twitter thread coming over the last 24 hours of a British hacker called Hacker Fantastic.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.760]   And he's been looking at all the connected devices in his home.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   He has an internet connected dishwasher. Now, I'm sorry, it can't stack itself.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.880]   There's no point in turning it on.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.280]   So what is the point of that? It's just needless.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.880]   I love the Samsung refrigerator with built in browser, which they couldn't update.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.720]   Yes, which I predicted. It was so funny. When that was first announced at CES,
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.840]   I like wrote something I was like, I love this fridge, but I would never buy it.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.240]   And my whole point was I was like, they're going to stop supporting this in a couple of years,
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.440]   and you're going to be left with a fridge that you can't update that is useless.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.840]   That is just a fridge that you have has all these other things that are not going to work.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:57.360]   And sure enough, that's exactly what happened. But what I love about this is just the ingenuity.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.680]   Now, I haven't read the article closely enough, but I'm assuming, like, I don't know if you had to
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:07.200]   make any sort of hardware tweaks. Let's put it this way. It involved the use of a Dremel tool.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:15.360]   Okay, so that's too much. But I do love the ingenuity there, which is basically,
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.840]   because what concerns me about these fridge is not so much the $50 thing, right? Like, that's annoying.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.160]   Okay, it's that at some point, GE is going to either, and I think they might have already done
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.440]   this, like they're going to sell their business. It's going to go to somebody else. And like,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.480]   they're not going to support the filters anymore or the API that they use to call out.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.080]   The endpoint is going to be deprecated. And then you're not going to be able to replace
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.480]   the filter in your fridge. And it's like, okay, well, do I have to get a whole new fridge now?
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.480]   Because the, you know, it doesn't work. We're just like HP. Yes.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.800]   It's did with the in cartridges. And that's terrible. No, no.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.760]   This is the mismatch between durable goods, like a refrigerator the last 10, 20 years.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.480]   And the stuff we talk about, which last year or two, at best,
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.560]   is what happened with Sonos. It's what happened with Wink. Now you have to pay a subscription
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.400]   for your Wink. Well, Sonos, I can give them a pass to a certain extent because A, they're still
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.200]   going to support it as long as possible. And B, like it was going back like 15 years. So honestly,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.800]   I'm not mad at Sonos. But I think there's a difference between buying like a Blu-ray player
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   that I know and, you know, four or five years, the services that are on it aren't going to work
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:31.040]   anymore. Like my parents, I replaced their Roku that I got them years earlier with a fire TV stick
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.920]   for Christmas. And their Roku had a blockbuster button on it. So, you know,
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.280]   right. So, but I expect the certain apps and certain things like that to stop working. And
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.160]   that's okay. Because as you said, it's durable versus disposable. But a fridge,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.040]   I don't expect to have to say, oh, I need to have up to date API and endpoint connection so that
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:00.400]   it can verify the DRM chip on my filter so that, you know, my water is not gross. I mean, that's
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:07.920]   I see I see stuff like this and I worry or not worry. But I always question like, what are the
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.720]   legal ramifications of this? In the US, he has bigger, I'm sure he has bigger fish to fry and not
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.840]   necessarily thinking about coming after this person. But they can't and they can't. In fact,
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.680]   the register specifically addresses this. Thank goodness in the US, you own the refrigerator,
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:32.560]   you can hack it. Well, that's still that's still up for. I mean, the right to repair issue is a
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.040]   larger. Yeah, the right to repair issue is really kicking it. And it's one of the things that really
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.960]   grinds my gears because if I spend, you know, 500 bucks on a fridge, I expect to own the damn thing.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.480]   I do not expect to be renting it with, you know, with the possibility of keeping food cold on occasion.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.880]   It's just like, it's the same thing with, you know, a car or anything else. You if you
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.400]   something with music, I mean, do you remember when CDs first came out? Well, maybe not for
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.520]   younger for you. Yeah, but I do. When CDs first came out, it was like, buy to own for the rest of
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.160]   your life. And then you find out, actually, you know, you bought it in that format. And if you rip
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:19.280]   it, you're breaking the law. I have got Sergeant Pepper 12 times album cassette, eight track CD,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.240]   digital download, enhanced digital download, super remixed, enhanced digital download.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   And the DMCA still not on your door. And they still say what's that pirated?
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.600]   So yes, the register called Gay Gordon Byrne, executive director of the repair association.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:46.000]   And gay said that there's two things protecting you hacking your refrigerator filter. The copyright
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:55.920]   office said software enabled, replying repair is allowed. And the Magnus and Moss warranty act
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.560]   guarantees consumers can use parts not from the original manufacturer. You actually protected.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:06.160]   Because this is back when Congress actually did things that helped consumers. So you can,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.640]   you're allowed to do it, at least in the United States. Yeah, I mean, the problem is they throw
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:17.680]   the DMCA in there a lot. Right. Right. You can't reverse engineer. If you reverse engineer something,
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:24.400]   you're technically under threat from DMCA. Yeah. And hence why he used a Dremel tool.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   Because the fix is take your old filter, Dremel out the RFID chip, and tape it to the sensor.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.360]   Then you can use any filter you want. So I don't think that violates reverse engineering as far as
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.000]   I could. I would love to do that with my print owners. Christine pointed out, you know, HP have
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.160]   been pulling this rubbish. Terrible is terrible. And it's not making throw away, not quite empty
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.320]   car. But don't who's the coffee maker that does that? I don't know if it's a curricure.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.000]   It does that you can't use non curric cartridges. Well, people found a way to get around that,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.920]   because their, I guess, DRM, so to speak, was relatively easy to bypass. But yes, I mean,
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.040]   that's the whole thing. You need like a special chip of sorts to work with your
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.400]   curric. And HP, I mean, they've gotten even further than they've had. They've been sued,
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.000]   and they've had to backtrack. I mean, they were at one point, I believe, like issuing software
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.560]   updates that would, you know, like brick your printer, if you weren't part of some sort of
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.800]   subscription service or something, where even if you were using HP, Inc, if you weren't part of
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:36.640]   some other thing that the printer would be pricked. I mean, you know, but it's ridiculous. I'm the
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.560]   type of person that I don't even buy their refills. I would never refill my own ink cartridge,
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.080]   because that's just, I'm going to get it all over myself. Exactly. But the fact that you're saying,
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.720]   oh, we're going to put a chip on this, and this is the only way you can use it, is just draconian
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.600]   and terrible. It's awful. Right. I swear at one point in time, when I was having to, you know,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.800]   go get new printer ink, I would just go buy a new printer because it was.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.160]   It was literally there's something wrong with a system where it's actually cheaper to buy the
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.640]   printer than buy new cartridges. But then they got wise to you, Ant. They did. They did the
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.040]   hand modification. They just put a teaspoon of ink in the new ink, in the new cartridges,
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:21.280]   the printer cartridges. It's a little bit. Yeah. Starter cartridges. I call them actually.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.880]   Starter cartridges. You might as well start your way on your way to the office supply store now,
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.280]   because you're going to need it. All right. That's a good start.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.960]   Thank you, register.com. The register.com. Are you going to get rid of the at some point?
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.840]   Oh, you can't do that. No. I mean, you've got to have some standards.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:49.280]   It is the register. It's cleaner. This is actually another great story. It makes me very happy.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:57.440]   Happy. If you use ZFS, which is a really good file system, unfortunately, not widely used,
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.160]   even in Linux where it's available. Thanks, Oracle.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:08.960]   Yeah, because it came from Sun. But the co-creator of Open ZFS, Matt Arons,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:16.160]   submitted a GitHub pull request. I think this is so great to the Open ZFS code database
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:21.200]   to remove unnecessary references to slavery. This is an example of there's a lot of
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.840]   ellipse service played that Black Lives Matter. But I love it when somebody says,
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.080]   "Oh, well, let's do something about that," because Master and Slave is a part of the
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.600]   nomenclature in computers, hard drives, but also in ZFS, you have slave pools.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:45.280]   And he says, "Let's eliminate," the quote is unnecessary references to slavery.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.000]   The horrible effects of human slavery continue to impact society, no kidding.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.400]   The casual use of the term slave in computer software is an unnecessary reference to a painful
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.280]   human experience. We're also seeing people remove white lists and black lists.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:07.440]   This is an example of unconscious racism, black, bad, white, good.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:14.960]   And you don't need it. If you have a block list and an allow list, that's actually much better.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.920]   It tells you what you're getting. Now, Ian, you brought up black hat and white hat hackers.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.360]   We've got to come up with something. Well, yeah, we've got the black
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.640]   coming up in August. And I think they've got some fairly serious questions they need to ask
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.600]   themselves about where we're going with this. Black hat, gray hat, white hat has been
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.880]   established for a long, long time. But as you say, it's unconscious racism.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:45.120]   And we can find better terms. It's not outside the realms of possibility that we can't find
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.480]   another way to do this. Yeah, I mean, honestly, block list and allow list is much better than
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.760]   black list and white list. It's a hundred times better. And frankly, primary drive and secondary
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.200]   drive is much better than master and slave. So I think that's possible. I don't know about
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.600]   black hat and white hat. Good guys and bad guys, maybe. I don't know.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:14.400]   I was thinking good guys, bad guys, meh guys. I'm a meh guy. I don't know. Somewhere in the
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.320]   between. I like it. I'm a man on the photography side. I've seen a little bit of this happening
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:27.040]   with with studio flash. You used to see slave one slave to if you're using multiple
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:34.960]   studio strobes in your shoot. Now I've noticed a lot of them are just S one, S two or something.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.360]   It may seem trivial. It may seem like it's just a word. But I think if we can root out unconscious
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:47.680]   acknowledgement, I'm all for it. Freaking acknowledge it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know exactly.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.720]   This is how things get, you know, it's baby steps at first, but we'll get there. You know,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.840]   it's just constantly push, push, push. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's been interesting that the
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.960]   Git community has been having the discussion too with, you know, there've been a lot of people
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.600]   who have been renaming their master branches on GitHub and other places, other repositories to
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.480]   Maine or to trunk or just something like that. And you know, then there was, of course, what happens
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.880]   which is frustrating in these conversations is that the pedants want to go into like the history
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.920]   of why was this term used and could it be something else? And it's like, no, you know, and it turned
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.280]   out actually with with Git that it was, you know, inferred from Bitkeeper, which was using
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.560]   master and slave in that way. Yeah. There is something to be said that, you know, the term mastery
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.040]   is different than like there are different contexts to use the word. Having said that,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.240]   if someone's uncomfortable and if we can use a different word and if it's going to help, you know,
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:48.800]   acknowledge as as Ann said, the many problems that we've had historically, I'm all for it like.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.760]   And by the way, where you might debate master, there's no debate about what the slave is.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:00.560]   No, there's not. There's no alternate use of the term slave. That's pretty clear. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.640]   yeah, I mean, it's words matter. You know, this is this is how this stuff gets changed over time.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.880]   And if you if you raise a generation of people on that language, then it does have a knock on
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:17.920]   effect. So that's sort of out. Some progress also in face recognition, very happy to see
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.280]   IBM started saying, and I don't think it was a big cost IBM. I don't know how big their face
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:30.320]   recognition business was, but they decided to withdraw from face recognition market because
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.920]   they were worried about profiling. And we all know the face recognition. For, you know, I guess
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:41.600]   because of the data set, it's fed is very bad. It pretty is a lot of false positives among people
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:49.680]   of color, because mostly trained and white folk. Microsoft then followed, selling saying,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:56.240]   we're not going to sell face recognition technology. We have it to police until Congress passes a new
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   privacy law. And then, and this was the big one Amazon because Amazon has a program called
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:12.480]   recognition with a K might as well be three Ks that is widely used by police. They say they're
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.400]   going to ban police using it for one year. And the hope is, I think, with all of these,
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:26.240]   that Congress will come in, step in and regulate it. You know, since 2008, Illinois has had strict
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:32.560]   controls on on all kinds of biometrics appropriately. You have to notify if you're using it. You have
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.640]   to give people control of it. You can have to give them the ability to delete it much like GDPR.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:43.200]   That's been 2008. That's been a long time. That's been the long. I think this is not a bad idea.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:50.560]   And again, it gives me, we were talking before the show, I've seen a lot of movements in my many
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:56.880]   years going back to the civil rights movement. And Martin Luther King, and it always seems one
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.360]   step forward, two steps back, one step forward, two six back for the first time ever. I don't know
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.960]   about you, I see you have the sign your son made when you marched in the protests in the
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.880]   Ronert Park, Black Lives Matter, No Justice, No Peace. I like it that instead of an oh justice,
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:18.720]   an oh piece, he wrote K and O justice K and O piece. That's kind of cool.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.360]   Even though even though he's the spawn of my lawns, he's actually pretty smart.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:29.440]   That was was that Jacob or Isaac? That was Jacob. That's really great. That's really
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.600]   hard. He's hard. Hard head.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.320]   So what was I saying? I feel like there's hope. I don't know about you. And let me ask you
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.080]   because you're the one who's got to bear the brunt of this. You know, I was the other day,
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:49.760]   Lisa and I went our rare outing, you know, or gotten cabin fever. And we went to his little bee farm
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.200]   in town and they're open like one day a month. And we went and we got honey and stuff. It was
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.680]   really fun. They've had lavender fields and stuff. And it was right after, I think it was right after
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:05.280]   George Floyd. And it was, you hit me that this is an easy thing for us to do as white people go out,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:13.920]   getting a car go somewhere, be somewhere. But for you and your boys and I'm sure you're in
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.960]   Petaluma. Maybe it's not a huge calculus, but it's got to always be back of your brain. Is this a safe
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.800]   space? Is this somewhere I can go? Am I going to meet racism? Am I going to meet?
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:30.000]   Does that I mean, that would be a constant low hum. Yeah, unfortunately, sir, it is always in the
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.760]   back of my head. And I believe I've mentioned this here in the network before that when I get up to
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:43.040]   go do my morning walks at 6 a.m., I typically go out for number one, stupid cardio, kind of hit
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:48.320]   cardio. But number two, I like to, I like to go shoot. I like to take my camera with me.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.720]   And you got to think twice about that. So when I go out, I typically have on orange. And most
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:00.240]   people think the orange is because of my affinity towards Clemson football and so forth. It's not
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:07.440]   just that it's so I can be seen. And I'd like to be seen off in a distance. So I don't come off
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:16.560]   as surprising someone. Are you reluctant to wear a mask? No, because I don't want to get sick if I
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.920]   can help it. But I'm still wearing, I still wear orange t-shirts, orange sweatshirts. I usually
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.160]   keep some type of bright color shirt in the trunk of my car because I never know if I'm
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.480]   going down the road and something gets my attention. I'd like to take a photograph. I'll get out the
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.800]   car, put on my bright colors, not go walk. But I've said, you have to think of that constantly.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:45.200]   Yeah. So I, in one day, it'll change at one point. I've not been optimistic about it. But
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.480]   I'm getting a little more optimistic based on the things that I've seen here the last two weeks.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.760]   Just as you said, it seems like there's a movement happening now. It's encouraging.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:01.680]   Because it feels like more people, especially more of us white folks, are starting to get it.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:07.920]   Right. It's an amplification of the message that I've said and other people of color have
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:14.800]   tried to say for decades. And it's great. Now, this still doesn't diminish the fact that there's
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:21.680]   still some other issues inside of the black community in particular. Yes, police are still
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:27.280]   on the hook for all of these heinous crimes that they've done towards people of color. But
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.520]   black folks, I'm talking to you right now that are listening, we still got to be
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.600]   do better as a community ourselves and stop with the black on black crime too.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.120]   No one tends to mention that. Yeah.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:46.240]   Look, no one's perfect. No. It has very little to do with the color of your skin. That's the whole
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:52.560]   point. You know, underneath that skin, we're exactly the same. Well, you have more muscles than I do,
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:59.200]   but that's that's something you worked on. Yes. But it is remarkable how how quickly these things
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.920]   change because it was my birthday on Friday and I'm a grumpy sod on my birthday. Always have been
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:12.160]   I hate it. But I found out that June 12th is Loving Day, which in 1967 was the Supreme Court
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:19.040]   ruling that said that the international marriage was now legal in the US. I had no idea that it
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.520]   wasn't legal anymore. There's a great documentary on the Lovings. Yeah. Yeah, that's about long ago.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:31.520]   Yeah, exactly. It's barely 50 years ago. And already the very idea that that should be a ban
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:37.120]   is ridiculous. And hopefully it'll be less than 50 years, but we can shift on to a point where,
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:44.080]   you know, the current culture wars or whatever, you know, we just there are a relic of history,
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:50.400]   you know, racism, sexism, homophobia, we can get past that. I really hope so. But hopefully it's
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:57.680]   not going to take for another 50 years. But loving zero arrested in Virginia in 1958, Virginia had
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:07.280]   the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which made the misagination of crime. Police raided their home
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:13.280]   and they took it. Thank goodness. They took it all the way to the Supreme Court and won.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:19.600]   That's awesome. And, you know, cheese loves. Man, it's all about love. I love it that they're
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:25.120]   named the Lovings. They couldn't be better. You know, that's all. So it's Loving Day. Yeah.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.280]   No, I mean, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Mr. Thompson.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.800]   Oh, I was just coming back to the facial recognition thing. I'm
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.440]   Yeah, me too. As is expected of me, I'm slightly cynical about this whole thing because Amazon
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.520]   said, yeah, we're not going to use cell recognition to the police. They didn't mention any other,
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.200]   and we asked them about this. They didn't block out selling it to any other federal
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:56.720]   federal agency, like CBP or the DOD. Microsoft said, well, we're not going to sell it until
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:02.160]   there's a law passed. But we weren't actually selling it to them in the first place. Our system
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:08.400]   is really isn't that good. I've qualified their statement in such terms that they could,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.200]   you know, there's enough loopholes in there to drive a cut truck through. So it's a good step,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.000]   but let's not get taken in by the PR washing because they left themselves.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.040]   Landscape wiggle room. No, agreed. And I think I was just going to say the one thing I think
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.840]   that is important to think about too, is that, look, I think all the major companies, including
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.760]   disclosure of the company that I work for, although I don't know anything about the stuff that they
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.440]   make, I think it's important that they stand up and say, we're not going to be doing this.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.080]   But we also have to think about we do need legislation because what about all the companies
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:45.200]   out there that like Palantir and whatnot that have no problem, you know, selling to different
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:51.760]   organizations just because the big players are not doing it doesn't mean that the technology,
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:57.600]   which may be good and may be bad. And in some cases, when it's bad, it can be even more harmful,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.960]   won't still be sold and still be available to these organizations.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.000]   Yeah, Palantir really worries me because,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.600]   ethically, you know, they've got all the self control of a Labrador presented with an unguarded
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   roast chicken. I mean, they will take that data, grab it, use it, stuff it and sell it.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:22.560]   You know, they have, it seems a company with very few ethics at all. And, you know, yeah,
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.440]   it's nice that the big players are staying out of it, but someone's going to sell this stuff.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.280]   It's going to be interesting because Palantir's planning an IPO in the fall.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:37.280]   And that'll be the first time anybody can look beneath the curtain, behind the curtain,
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.000]   at what these guys are up to. I mean, for a long time, it was just a mysterious thing.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.640]   There's also, let's point out Clearview AI, which maybe...
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.120]   Come back.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.440]   Okay, that's one way to put it. Yeah.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:57.280]   They were scraping face recognition information from Facebook and Instagram because, of course,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.480]   a lot of people are posting pictures of people, not even them of themselves and tagging them.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:09.600]   And Clearview AI was able to build a massive database of people's pictures matched with their
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:16.160]   name and they've been selling that to police. And they've always been a little bit sketch.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.560]   There's a really good NPR. I mean, it was the Daily. I think it was the Daily from the New York
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.120]   Times did a story about trying to track down the founder and what exactly they were up to.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:34.080]   And in fact, one of the things that happened in this story is that the reporter offered her
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.880]   picture to a police officer who had the Clearview AI account. I remember that story.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:45.200]   And she didn't show up. But everybody else does. She didn't show up. So she finally,
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.040]   she gets ahold of the Clearview AI founder and CEO and asks him. He says,
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:56.080]   she said, "Are you blocking press people from your database?" He said, "That was a bug.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.080]   That was a bug." She started showing up. Now it is. That was a bug.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:07.600]   If you're interested in what Clearview AI is all about, that Daily episode from a few weeks back is
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:13.920]   very odd. They're getting sued by the social media people at the moment. But it comes back to,
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.240]   there's that famous quote from Mark Zuckerberg. It was just like, they're giving me all this personal
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:24.000]   information, the idiots. That's the idiots. And he said that. Yeah. He said that. Yeah.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:32.080]   And he's honestly, it's just, I can see it from his perspective. It's a moral as all hell. But
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.720]   I can see why he's happy about it. I'm just glad that we're all wearing masks.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.600]   Face recognition has become that well. Although I'm sure they're all working on ways to do it from
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:48.000]   just your eyes and forehead. And we should point out there are some good uses for a face recognition,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.200]   right? It's not all bad. Right. We talked about it on this week in Google the other day.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.040]   If you haven't checked that out, go to t with that TV slash twig and check that out.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.960]   It's better. It's better. It's just that I am. I tell you.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:06.160]   Yeah, you're good. We talked a little bit about it. And I said that we need to have more people
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:12.000]   at the table when it comes to developing this technology. And I don't want people to confuse it
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.720]   with saying, Hey, get more black people in there and get more people. Yeah, that doesn't solve it.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.360]   Yeah. That no, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying we need different perspectives in there.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.880]   If you're someone, this may be a bad example, but if you're someone that loves the band, I don't
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:32.240]   know, Pearl Jam or whatever, you're going to tend to hang out with other people that like that same
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.360]   same band and what and whatnot. And when you go to talk about music, all you talk about is Pearl Jam
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.280]   when there's a vast, vast library of other musicians and other types of music out there.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:48.320]   So you should have some other perspectives come in and say, Hey, you might want to check out.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.680]   Hey, I don't know. MC Hammer, I don't know.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:36:00.240]   MC Hammer gives you another perspective is all I'm saying. And just because you're.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.720]   Well, that's why I want women. That's why I want blacks. That's what we want.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:10.800]   Spanics ages. We want diversity. You can't. And the problem is Silicon Valley is essentially a
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.640]   monoculture. It is. And of course, these problems are going to crop up. When it's a bunch of white
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:24.800]   bros doing this stuff. You know, and it's it's it's not going to be easy to get all of those people,
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.840]   different types of people at the table when it's time to talk about these technologies. But there's
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.040]   still has to be an effort there. If you really want to make this work and not have it pull up
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.560]   an image of me and label it as it did on air as a wrongdoer.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:46.400]   Enough teen spirit. We want to legit to quit. Yeah, there you go.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.120]   It was interesting though, because they they fed members of the house of representatives
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.520]   through one of these systems. Oh, yeah, that was fine. A large number of black of black
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.880]   representatives as criminals. And you're like, yeah, your data. It's garbage in garbage out.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:06.960]   You know, your data set is not good. Yeah. But I mean, this and in a way, I think
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.560]   this is quite handy. I mean, from Microsoft's perspective, Brad Smith has always been very
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.920]   clear on this. He wants a legal situation set down so they know what parameters they're working in
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.640]   so they don't get sued to hell and back. But I think for people like IBM and from Microsoft and
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.680]   to an extent Amazon taking a year off from setting this, that gives them a lot of time for product
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.680]   development. So you can get this really spiffy again and they can sell it. It's a catch.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.280]   Like a slice you guys are putting on hold. We could do. Yeah.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:43.600]   Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Yeah. You know, of course, when an idea like Black Lives Matter
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.480]   starts to take hold in the country, companies are going to cynically step up.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:55.440]   But we were talking about this a couple of weeks ago. I think it was Dylan Twainy who said this.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.480]   I like what Sacha Nadella said. He said, it's our company.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.400]   We're not that was Wesley Faulkner was Wesley. You're right. Thank you.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   You watch the show. See you. You watch as I don't even before I was an employee.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:18.000]   I was a man. So yeah, Wesley said that. He said, I like what Sacha said because
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.760]   CEO of Microsoft said, look, we take responsibility and we're going to fix it in our company.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.400]   Instead of, you know, Black Lives Matter is no, we're going to we're going to fix it. We're going to
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   we take this seriously. So that's what you got to look for in these companies, not lip service,
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.680]   but actual action, you know, get some Black people on the board. I loved it.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:43.520]   That Reddit replaced Alexis O'Haney and stepped down and they and by the way, the woman that put
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:49.920]   it in his place is excellent. I can't remember who it is, but but at the time I read her by I was
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:57.360]   a woman, I think, right? No, I believe it's why something was this later.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:04.000]   We can look at this. We have the tick. Michael Seebull. We had the technology. Michael Seebull,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.960]   of course, I should have. I'm sorry. I'm like, why something? Yeah. Why Combinator? No, no.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.960]   He's CEO of Y Combinator. He's actually. No, but he was from Justin TV and he started
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:21.600]   Justin TV. I knew him back then in the day when I just seen. Yeah. I was going to say that's how I
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.200]   met him. Justin, when it was Justin TV, became Twitch. Yeah. Remember Justin had the
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:32.320]   backpack and he had a camera on them all the time. Yeah. So Michael's a really cool guy.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:39.200]   And he's actually very well respected in Silicon Valley. So good replacement for Alexis. Who was
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.360]   also respected? But he doesn't need the money. I think that was a good thing for him to do.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.600]   Step down and say, you know what? We need more. We need a Black member on this board.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.200]   Well, I'm saying it was putting his money where his mouth is because he's donated a million to the
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.080]   cause. And when you get Facebook of all people, wow, we're putting 10 million in the site. Really.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.200]   That's what that is. Ten minutes. Ten minutes. Yeah.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:05.680]   Billions. Right. Just like me checking up a penny and cutting in half first.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:11.200]   Reddit is a really, really important example because Reddit can be a cesspool. There's good
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.000]   in bed on Reddit. I love Reddit. But I am very careful about what subreddits I follow.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.320]   Because there's only a band from the Donald's. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So that's actually quite a
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:30.240]   challenging job Michael's going to have. Because it's hard. Free speech is important too.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:37.040]   But and you don't want Reddit to become 4chan. So you really got a tough balance.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.960]   I like Reddit a lot though. And I'm glad that and I love at a level X's.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:49.360]   I mean, the Intel news this week, the Jim Keller decided to take another
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:57.600]   job from his chip design work with with Chip Zilla. You know, Tim, sorry, Jim
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:03.040]   always shifts around a lot. But it was interesting when I was going through the story that, yes,
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:09.120]   he was left and of the four people that were moved in the reshuffle, three of them weren't
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:15.280]   white Americans. It was all immigrants coming in. So I mean, there are this this move. It's
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.240]   growing slowly. The whole thing that you have to be an old white guy to lead to tech companies
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:28.640]   just isn't the case anymore. I mean, look at Microsoft, Google, look at it's not going to be too
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.760]   long before the rest of the industry catches up. To some degree, I think this is part of the
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:40.640]   reason we're going through this in America right now. California is no longer a majority white state.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.920]   Whites are in a minority in California, and that's gradually happening across the country.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.600]   And I think some of this, the paroxysm we're going through and this kind of
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:59.040]   is comes from a fear that us white guys are losing our position that we're becoming a minority.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:06.080]   And I think it's important to reassure old white men like me, look, your privilege isn't going to
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:12.800]   disappear completely. But it's nice to share a little bit. Well, but also, I mean, and I push back a
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.520]   little bit on, I mean, I know that technically it's like, okay, whites are the majority, but if you're
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:23.680]   it's still like 40%. So if you were to if you're to take all the different other groups, like,
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.960]   you know, it's hard to find another one that has that like a higher percentage than 40% right.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:37.920]   And so, you know, even that that framing, I think is oftentimes, you know, bait to make old white
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.720]   guys feel uncomfortable and feel disenfranchised when they're not disenfranchised and haven't been
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.280]   disenfranchised and won't be disenfranchised. If even if you know, they're, you know, the number
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.680]   was worth a fall even more. And honestly, that's not what it's about. If that's what happens,
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:43:01.760]   it couldn't happen to a better bunch. I think it's time to practice a little humility from now.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:07.920]   But that's why Virginia had a law against interracial marriage. They were they didn't
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.480]   want to muddy the waters, so to speak. They don't want to let brown babies running around. That was
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.760]   they were, oh my God, what's going to happen? And we can reassure the Steve Miller's of the world,
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:24.320]   the David Dukes of the world. There'll still be white people. Yeah, just maybe not sitting on top
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.880]   of all the other people. Well, I mean, the late great British comedian Jeremy Hardy had a lovely
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.200]   phrase on this, which was just like, people who have been known what it was like before, you know,
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.440]   the Asians and the Vietnamese and the blacks came to Britain as like, what was it like? You know,
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.880]   you went out on a Friday night in the pub on what you had left, the scone shop,
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:47.120]   now you've got curries. The Indian food in London is phenomenal. It's the best food in London.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:53.200]   The actual dish of the UK in terms of popularity is chicken, chicken, masala, which was invented in
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:44:01.120]   Glasgow, but you know, I mean, it just we gained an awful lot of them. I don't get that. Go to
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:06.640]   Tokyo. There's a curry shop on every corner. Oh, yeah, it's marvelous. Wonderful. I mean,
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:13.280]   it's kind of like when I first came to America, I was fed a Thanksgiving dinner with sweet potato
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:19.120]   and marshmallow mixed. It was the soupline. The soupline thing I ever come across. Give me some
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:26.320]   rice and pee any day. Oh, boy. Yeah, you and I go out to hook up.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:33.040]   Mrs. Cook boy. My smoker. My smoker now comes on Wednesday and you got to come over and
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:39.280]   yeah, we got a smoke. Break it in for you. Break it in for me. All right. Well, that was our register
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:49.920]   dot com the register dot com segment. You know, I'm not blowing smokey and it is the register is
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:54.000]   has always been a great publication and it's only getting better. I have to think some of that has
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.440]   to do with the fact that you're the news editor really stellar work. Thank you. Honestly, I've
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   only been there for, oh my god, nine years. I'm an old cheese. But the register's been around for 25
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:15.680]   years and it was just it was set up as a technology tabloid bring tabloid headlines. Yeah, love that.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:21.520]   Good stuff in the copy. But you know, honestly, the IT industry is right for taking the piss
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.080]   up. So why not? You need it. Yes. What is your favorite register headline?
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.920]   It's it's probably a bit rude to say on air. We did manage to get it through.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:40.640]   Okay. Well, it was when it was when there was the it was when Dick Costello set left as
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:49.440]   CEO of yeah, and and gave it to Jack. So it was big dick pulls out Jack's off to the hot seat.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:58.160]   That unfortunately got pulled up about 24 hours a day. So the complaints were huge.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.800]   If you have to explain that to the kids, don't please don't.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:12.480]   That's that's peak. Oh, right. Oh my gosh. That's gold. Somebody asked me the other day. Why do you
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:19.120]   guys always call Google the chocolate factory? Oh, that's well, Google hate it. I mean, I
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:24.400]   that's reason enough. No, no, I mean, the reason we do it is because at the same reason we refer to
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.920]   Microsoft as Redmond or Intel as chipzilla or Cisco or switchzilla is that you can't have the
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.280]   same word twice in a sentence. So when they're calling themselves Google Cloud, we can't then
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.760]   put Google in the same sentence. The reason we call them the chocolate factory was a reference to
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.640]   Willy Wonka because they were developing all these marvelous things. They didn't tell you about
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.400]   them. And then they came out with them. You know, I mean, you remember when Gmail came out, it came
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.680]   out in April the 1st and people weren't in touch. They sure it wasn't a joke.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:47:01.920]   I thought it was a joke. Yes. Yeah. So we started calling them the chocolate factory and they hated
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.520]   it. I've had a PR say to me, if we could convince you to stop calling us that, my career would be
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:17.520]   made. Oh, that's awesome. And you're just like, for goodness sake, grow up. I would like it making
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.040]   that call basically just ensure that they will be the chocolate factory forever.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.440]   Yeah, but it's a compliment. I mean, Willy Wonka was a fantastic character.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.880]   Ignore the films. Read the books. Read the chocolate factory in the great glass elevator. Willy Wonka
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:38.560]   flawed, though he was was a great person. Just like any other large company.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:44.240]   He tortured small children, but they deserved it. They always deserved it.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.480]   Exactly. Absolutely deserved it. My favorite books of all time, it's difficult because
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.360]   rolled all is very problematic. But Willy Wonka in the chocolate factory rather is one of my
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.280]   favorite books in history. I read it to the kids. James and the giant peach. I loved his stuff.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:06.400]   Yeah, Matilda, my mom read my mom read Charlie and the chocolate factory to my sister when she was
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:11.600]   pregnant with me. And there's like, you know, obviously no way to prove this, but I have a feeling
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.560]   that that's why, like from the time I was little, little, little, like that book in the movie,
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.920]   the one from 1970, were always, you know, my favorites. All right. And let's not forget,
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:28.720]   he also wrote the Twits. Oh, it was less than no books. But yeah.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:34.640]   I would recommend his adult stuff, to be honest. It's slightly filthy, but it's very amusing in
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:43.520]   its way. Yeah. A number of books of short stories, I think SwitchBitch was one of them and various
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:50.000]   others. Oh my. But fascinating bloke. Yes, problematic, as you say, and that, you know,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.760]   originally the umpel umpers were pygmies. And then the publishers were just like,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:59.600]   "mate, not really a good idea." It's 1960. We're a bit more woke than that now.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.880]   And, but yeah, I mean, he had an interesting life. He served in the Second World War,
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:13.200]   seducing American women for the course of peace. God bless him. No, no, he was sent over here as a
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:19.760]   spy to basically to support to get American support for carrying on the war against Germany.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.040]   And apparently slept with the wife of Henry Luce, I think it was, in order to enlist her support.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.800]   He wrote a fantastic memo to his embassy. It was just like, I'm utterly exhausted. I cannot do this
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:35.200]   anymore. It was just like for Britain, if you'd ever seen a picture of Claire Booth Luce, you would
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:43.840]   know why this is the twits that Mr. Twitt hates his wife, misses Twitt to test her husband,
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.880]   the repulsive pair like nothing more than playing wicked tricks on one another.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:56.880]   Sooner or later, things are going to go too far. Okay. Okay.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.480]   His granddaughter Sophie Dahl tells a story that she'd been, he'd been telling the
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.920]   story about someone who speaks dreams into someone's ear and they went to bed. And then there was a
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.800]   sound outside of a ladder going up and he was there with a speech trumpet trying to speak through
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.840]   the window at them until his wife told him to get down before he broke his neck. But yeah,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.160]   interesting chap. And as Christina points out, I mean, he's semi.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:31.840]   And you know, this is, you know, it's problematic. Apple. So, so gone with the wind as an example,
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:39.360]   a movie made in 1939. And it's a racist movie. Let's face it as much of the world.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:45.520]   Certainly America was just a reflection of the world. Yeah. HBO Max decided to yank it,
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:50.720]   not to put it on HBO Max. They say they're going to bring it back. And I think this is a good
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:57.360]   solution with additional material explaining the time and so forth. But I noticed on my,
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:02.800]   maybe this is me, but on my Apple TV, all of a sudden gone with the wind is the number one download.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:10.240]   Yeah. Yours too. Yeah. I've seen that too. And which, which makes me sad because the film is
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.840]   incredibly flawed. The book that it was based on is incredibly flawed. I grew up in Atlanta,
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.480]   Georgia, where we use the market, where we used to go to the Margaret Mitchell house for school
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.200]   field trips. And my, my, my issue with the film, I mean, it's sort of an interesting film in that
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.760]   it was directed by people who were not part of the South. The actors were all British. Right.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:34.880]   Which was sort of funny in and of itself because it became, to me, the films was problematic
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:39.360]   about the film. There are lots of things, but it's more that it created, I believe, this
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:46.480]   hagiography of what the South was like. Beautiful South. Grand old South. Yeah. And so it created
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.280]   this illusion for a lot of people, especially a lot of white people who live in the South that could,
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:56.320]   they could tell themselves, Oh, this is what it was like. And things weren't that bad for,
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.880]   for slaves. And, and this has been overblown. And I think that's the problem of the film.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:06.080]   Having said that, it is like, you can't not make the argument. There's not an argument that
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:11.520]   anyone can intellectually make that it is not one of the most important films of all time and that
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.800]   it's not one of the most influential. And if you look at, like, especially the first 20 years of
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:23.120]   cinema, 30 years of cinema, it is one of the most important and is frankly, probably had more of
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:28.560]   an impact than almost any other type of, there are maybe five films and it's definitely in the top
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.720]   five, probably in the top three that have had the greatest impact on not just the future of the
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:38.080]   film industry, but of, you know, on television and on other mediums too. So it's one of those where
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.160]   I love that they're going to add context because they need to add the context and they need to
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:46.240]   talk about the problems with it. But it's also one of those where you can't erase it. You don't
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:51.360]   want to bury it. You can't pretend like gone with the wind never happened. Right. Right. For all of
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:56.800]   its flaws. Same thing with old doll. Same thing with Henry Ford. Same thing with Winston Churchill.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:03.280]   It makes me excuse it, but you have to view it in context. Right. It makes me think there was a
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:09.840]   spike in the downloads because one generation that just don't really know anything about it. So
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:17.440]   you're really glad to see that is number the number one most viewed movie on Apple TV is like,
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.000]   oh my god. And I hope that it's that. I hope that it's that it's curiosity.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:29.600]   Whose curiosity? My fear is that it is this impulse to say, oh, well, it's it's banned and it's not
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:34.960]   banned. It's just not on a streaming service for free for a few weeks and that people as part of
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:41.680]   their like, what they see as a free or reflex to overly PC culture when that's not what this is,
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.720]   or is to say, oh, well, I'm going to give Warner Brothers my $10 anyway. It's like, okay, you know,
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   if the conversation were truly to say, this is not going to be available on streaming,
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   I think that's a broader conversation to have. The conversation is saying right now, maybe when
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.360]   this service is launched, maybe let's not have this and let's bring it back with proper context.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:07.280]   I think that is is a very fair thing to have because the film has had such an impact on so
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:12.400]   many things and we need to talk about that. But at the same time, I would not be in favor of
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:18.720]   people saying this film can't exist and can't be viewed because I'm for better or worse,
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.960]   pretty close to a free speech, absolutist. And this is our history and we need to own our history.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   We need to own the history. That's the truth.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.280]   Right. To see it as a historical document.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.800]   Tell it. Yeah. And not necessarily something to be proud of.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.520]   I mean, we've had this thing in the UK this week because I don't know if you've ever seen
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:41.760]   faulty towers. Yeah. They don't mention the war Germans episode. Now that was pulled briefly.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.600]   And I was like, oh, it's political correctness got mad. Why should we bother
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.080]   offending the Germans? It wasn't pulled because of the German references. It was pulled because
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:56.800]   one of the characters uses the N word a hell of a lot. Oh, Lord. And honestly, I think it's
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.840]   now been reinstated. But honestly, I'm with you on this. We should own this stuff. You know,
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:06.160]   we should say this is what it was like. This is why it was wrong. This is why we know it's wrong.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.240]   And this is what we're going to change it. We're fixing it. Yes. Yeah.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:15.280]   We're moving forward. Yes. We're going to move forward. We're not going to stay in the same
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:21.520]   period in same area with the same type of mentality. We're going to move forward with bigger and better
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:27.360]   ideas on this stuff. Yeah, this was this register segment. This is a good thing. We're going to do
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:34.640]   more of that. I do like to add that I still think the Carol Burnett show version of Gone With the Way
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:40.800]   Miss Better. I agree. I agree. I think that that is actually one of the best pieces of satire.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:47.280]   Like that's never seen the like it's it's oh my god. It's amazing. So it was like Carol.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:53.040]   Yeah. It was a comedy version of Gone With the Wind. It's called Gone With the Breeze.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:56:00.480]   Yeah. Something like that. The famous thing is where's the curtain? Yeah. Yes. Yes.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:06.720]   Yes. Very famously because because yes, that Scarlett O'Hara's dress was made from a curtain
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:11.360]   because she couldn't because the war because the war gone with the wind or went with the wind.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:16.320]   All right. So it is I think it is on yes, it is. It's on your is the curtains on YouTube. Yeah.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:24.480]   So probably illegally and I won't show it but you could find it. I will be watching it secretly.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:30.320]   I draw the blinds clock. Well, we're talking wind one of the twit people in the chat room
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.560]   has mentioned a mighty wind which is an absolutely fantastic film. Another great idea. I recommend
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:40.000]   you. But that's not about slavery in this in the anti-no. No, no. That's about folk singers.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.160]   Yeah. But they you know, folks thing is, you know, they have that problem too.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:53.120]   I'll show I love you guys. It's Ian Thompson from the register.com. It's Christina Warren
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:59.040]   from Microsoft.com. They're not changing their URL. I don't think and it's Ant Pruitt from
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.920]   twit.tv, the host of hands on photography. So great to have all three of you. This is
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:12.560]   this is too much fun to I shouldn't get paid. No paycheck today, Lisa. This is I don't forget
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:20.560]   I said that. Yeah. Too late. I'm gonna say. Yeah. Nailed it. Whoops. Whoops. How am I going to get
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:28.400]   my vlogger camera? You don't play. Yeah, I know. I'm probably getting a slack right now. Okay.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:34.800]   All right. So they brought to you by Zen desk. You know the name Zen desk. This is this is one of

[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.440]   that. The timing is really good. Let your customers know, "Yeah, we're still here. We still care about
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:09.360]   you. How are you doing? How are you doing right now? We're here for you. zendesk.com/twit.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:19.040]   Really happy to welcome Zen desk to our Twit family. That's fantastic. Let's say moving right along.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.480]   You may remember, we even talked about it, the president. Happy birthday, Donald, by the way.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.800]   The president's executive order saying, "Screw Twitter." I believe that was in the preamble.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:45.600]   Screw Twitter. The hell with you, you evil. That sounds more like it.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:54.880]   Now, the four senators have written a letter to the FCC. I presume they're serious asking the FCC
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:04.320]   to act. We mocked the executive order as being meaningless. On the other hand, if Congress gets
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:10.640]   behind it and the FCC gets behind it, it becomes a little more meaningful. It's really all about
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.520]   removing Section 230 protection. This is something that keeps coming up the Earned Act.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.880]   Section 230, there's even a book about it that says, "What was it like?" The 33 words it created
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:29.280]   the Internet. It's vital. It's a vital part of the Communications Decency Act that let's
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:35.120]   Twitter exist, that let's Facebook exist, that let's my blog comments exist, that let's our
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:44.400]   chatroom exist. It gives us the right to censor bad comments, remove inappropriate
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.880]   trolling, that kind of thing, without suddenly becoming a publisher. It's a safe harbor,
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.760]   without suddenly having the full responsibility of a publisher. It's a sensible way
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:00.560]   to handle this. It was actually created by Congress so that the Internet could continue
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:07.760]   and exist. Marco Rubio, Kelly Loeffler, Kevin Kramer, and Josh Hawley wrote a letter to the FCC,
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:13.920]   asking him to review Section 230 and, "Clearly define the criteria for which companies can
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:21.760]   receive protections under the statute." This is the argument coming from conservatives.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.720]   Social media companies have become involved in a range of editorial and promotional activity,
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:33.840]   like publishers. They monetize and otherwise editorialize user content. It's time to take
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.360]   a fresh look at Section 230 and interpret the vague standard of good faith with specific
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:47.520]   guidelines and directions. You agree? I'm torn on this one, I've got to say. This is an unpopular
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:54.320]   opinion, but I think with companies that are large enough, they have a duty to moderate their
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:02.400]   own content. At the red, we moderate our forums fairly strictly. I was at the press conference
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.680]   where Mark Zuckerberg said, "We want to be the newspaper for the world in the morning,
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.520]   and to have the public publishers' responsibility to check what stuff they put up there is accurate."
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:20.960]   It's a really fine line. I support Section 230. I'm a free speech advocate, but I think some
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:26.160]   companies are taking the piss when it comes to this. There needs to be some kind of balance,
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.840]   maybe a size limit on companies that have to actually moderate their own content.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.120]   An unpopular opinion, I know, but such is life. I think that there has...
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.240]   I agree that it would be nice to have a balance. It was interesting. On my podcast rocket this
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.760]   week, we had Catherine Turner-Costa, who's a policy analyst at the EFF on, and she and I are
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.560]   also longtime friends. We were talking about Section 230, and actually there was an interesting
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.560]   debate between her and Brianna Wu. She made an interesting point, which was, if we were to
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.480]   create the internet today, maybe we would make different decisions, and maybe there would be
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:10.080]   things that maybe we wouldn't have Section 230, maybe we wouldn't have a 520 from the DMCA.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:18.320]   But we do have the internet that we have. By making changes to 230, it's nice to look and say,
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.040]   "Okay, they would affect companies of a certain size, but the reality is, as we've seen with
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.320]   Cesta and some of the other, frankly, legislation, which has done more to hurt the people that it
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:36.160]   was hoping to protect, what you risk, I think, is that you risk only the companies that could afford
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.680]   to do their own moderation are then the only companies that would be able to exist."
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.360]   So that would be my fear to say, "Okay, if you have to be of a certain size to do this,
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.360]   that it would somehow become twisted in such a way that only the big companies would be able to
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:57.600]   exist and that smaller places wouldn't." And that would be my fear with implementing
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.800]   regulations that way. The irony of this is that this was part of the Communications
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.960]   Decency Act, which has since been struck down, the rest of it struck down by the Supreme Court,
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:13.760]   which was basically an act to censor the internet. And some wiser minds in Congress,
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:22.160]   including Ron Wyden, added this Section 230 to protect online sites so that they wouldn't,
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:29.600]   that they'd have the right to remove bad stuff without suddenly losing their protection,
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:35.360]   their safe harbor protection as a publisher. So it's a, I think it's often misunderstood,
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.960]   but the EFF, as you point out, says it's the most important law protecting internet speech.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.600]   It actually protects internet speech at this point. And in fact, Trump's executive order might
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.960]   have exactly the opposite effect forcing Twitter to start taking down his tweets, which would be
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:59.120]   kind of ironic. That's not his intent. His contention is that they're already taking down conservative
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:04.640]   tweets. And he didn't like it mostly. It was because he didn't like it that they commented on
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:09.920]   his tweets about email voting. Right. He's mad that he feels like he's a target,
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.720]   not realizing that if it becomes the safe harbor goes away and it becomes a liability,
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:20.800]   that way more of his speech and the speech of the people that he supports would become a liability
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.880]   for Twitter. And the problem with that though is that, okay, so Facebook and YouTube and
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.920]   Twitter might have enough money to fight some of these things, but smaller sites wouldn't.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:36.480]   And that, I think that becomes a really big issue to think about, okay, well, what happens
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:42.080]   there? And also basically ruins a lot of what has made the internet the internet for better or
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:46.000]   for worse. And I mean, I think it's fair to have a discussion that it's not all good.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.640]   I wouldn't have comments on my blog if it were for section 230.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.880]   It'd be too risky. Right.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:57.440]   Under the on the IRC chat, right? Like there would be no reasons.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:02.800]   You couldn't do IRC. You honestly, yes, YouTube has a lot of resources, but with hundreds of
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.400]   hours of content uploaded every minute, no company is big enough to review everything. So YouTube
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.640]   wouldn't exist. No, YouTube would give her comments as well. They would go to her comments and they
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.120]   would probably go to a method where you would have to apply to get an account to upload. Yeah,
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.800]   yeah, it'd be like China. You'd have to have a permit. Right.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:26.960]   It's exactly what you don't want. The other thing that you don't want is the FCC to start
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:32.320]   regulating Facebook and Google and Twitter. That's not their role. That's not their job.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:38.240]   The FCC regulates television and radio broadcast. Well, also, I mean, I mean, the FCC,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.000]   quite frankly, is about as effective as a lace condom when it comes to regulation.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.160]   So the idea that they're going to rule over all internet speech is horrifying.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:54.240]   I mean, they just, they are totally incompetent. So, you know, I mean, just seriously, there is a,
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:59.680]   the whole free speech. What I dislike about the section 230 things is now being used as a club
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.880]   to try and intimidate certain tech companies. That's really the point.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:07.760]   Mark Zuckerberg basically just rolled over and said, please don't hurt me.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:13.600]   Twitter said to hell with you. It's going to be very interesting to see how the other major players
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:21.680]   work on this. My problem is I oversimplify a lot of this stuff and don't tend to think about it
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:27.360]   from the aspect of a big, big company and just think about it as, you know, what would
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.400]   Aunt Pruitt do if this was his world kind of thing? And I totally get where Mr. Thompson's
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.880]   coming from, but there definitely has to be some sort of a balancing act in here.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:45.280]   I mean, it's really tricky because, you know, cheap laws may, you know, good laws may,
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:52.720]   make bad examples sometimes, but it's absolutely vital that you can put stuff online and not be,
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.600]   you know, and not be legally liable for it. But I do feel that some companies are taking the
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:02.160]   piss on this one. And maybe, you know, if you're worth more than 10 billion, yeah, you should be
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:09.600]   able to put some of that money into moderating your comments. I mean, pardon me, we'll just be
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.760]   like, no comments on YouTube. Great for your racist around. I don't mind no comments on YouTube,
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.520]   but it would still also cause problems with uploading on YouTube. Well, yeah, but I mean,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.880]   I mean, I found stuff on YouTube in the comments section, I found, you know, new artists, which I
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:27.040]   hadn't come across through reading comments. So I mean, there's, there's possible, this is the
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.320]   problem with the whole gosh darn internet. It's just it's bad and good. It'll just be nice.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.560]   It's too complicated. Yeah. I mean, on the one hand, I almost feel like I'm with you,
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:42.080]   Christina kind of free speech above all else. And I feel like Facebook should just say,
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:48.640]   it shouldn't weigh in at all and let anything be up there. Of course, it does, but with its
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.040]   newsfeed, it does weigh in because it out rhythmically selects what you see.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.600]   Yeah, and see that this is my problem with things like Facebook and to a certain degree Twitter,
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:03.280]   I if you want to take the position that, unless it violates the law, you can post it,
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.920]   I think that you can have an argument to do that where I have a problem with Facebook in particular,
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:15.680]   is that they elevate and give more the more publicity and they give more weight to stuff that gets
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.240]   the most interaction. And that's what a recent Wall Street Journal investigation showed is that
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.560]   they are all about the engagement and all about how much people are consuming and clicking and
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:30.400]   they're reinforcing people's ideas. And to me, that is not free speech, right? Like you can say,
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:37.360]   all right, you have the right to post this, but Facebook is not obligated to show that to more
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.520]   and more people because it gets the outrage collection. What does that other thing so if we,
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.760]   so my thinking is if we turned off the recommendation engines on YouTube, if we turned off the algorithms
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.200]   and the feed on Facebook, could we then have free speech? The other thing I would do probably on
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:59.520]   Facebook is ban political ads. I ban actually, I ban all ads because ads are where you really
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:05.200]   have problems on Facebook. That's the that's not the algorithm that's even worse in the algorithm.
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:11.440]   That's people using personal information to get to you. So that's problematic because Facebook
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.040]   would have to operate for free. I believe there's a story about debt.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.080]   Is it? I believe there's a story about debt in our rundown.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:23.600]   Find that story. We'll talk about it. We'll take a break and we'll talk about it.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.680]   I just, we have this, as you know, and we have this conversation on Twitter all the time and I
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.400]   cannot, I don't know what the right answer is. I think the algorithm is part of the problem.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.560]   Facebook, what if Facebook were just a bulletin board where people could post whatever they want?
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:44.960]   You know, but see, even though I am not a Facebook fan, I do get the premise of giving people what
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:52.080]   they want when it comes to content. If I am a fan of some particular sports team or whatever,
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.200]   give you more claims and tigers stuff. Yeah, let me see that because it's going to be right up my
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:03.280]   alley. I'm going to click on that and Facebook can leverage that information with advertisers and
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:09.280]   I get it. That makes business sense. But there's always a dark side to that, unfunctionally.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.880]   I mean, it's the problem is it's very, very profitable to build reinforcing chambers of
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:22.640]   sort of the, you know, if you can get people all, you know, worked up about the same thing,
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.120]   it turns out it's really profitable from an advertising perspective. But I mean, back in,
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.160]   until 1987 in the US, you had the fairness doctrine, which was if you were a broadcast media,
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.360]   you had to show both sides of the argument and Reagan got rid of that and now we've got
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:43.280]   talk radio, we've got, you know, a whole bunch of media outlets, which are basically propaganda
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:49.440]   for one side or the other. I would like to see the fairness doctrine reintroduced.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.760]   You can't put on the internet, but I mean, I mean, we're publishers. We are legally
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.520]   responsible for what we publish and section 230 helps us on the forums, but as journalists
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:05.120]   doesn't protect you. Your articles. Yeah. Yeah. Britain's got the toughest libel laws in the
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.800]   world. So we are, you know, we always case there's more yellow journalism coming out of Britain
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.880]   than any other country in the world. But yeah, because you learn how to play the game.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:20.960]   What can you actually say that's libelous? What can you say that isn't libelous, but which gets
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:28.160]   the same point across the CNN had a great documentary on the national enquirer, which is the original
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:34.560]   tabloid in the US. And he, the original publisher hired a lot of British journalists and editors,
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.480]   because you guys were so good at coming up with snarky articles about celebrities.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:46.960]   I mean, not to blow my entrombit, but I mean, the Brits do have a good reputation from journalists
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.800]   and for journalism. I mean, it's the old adage is you cannot hope to,
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:57.040]   oh, what's the phrase? You cannot hope to buy or twist the honest British journalists,
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.480]   but seeing what the man will do untwisted, there's no reason to. I mean,
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:07.600]   there are just like, there are, if you look at things like the sun and the mirror, I mean,
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.080]   these, these people are, I've worked with some of these people and they're ruthless. You know,
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.320]   they will go through your bins at 2am in the morning. They will hack your phone.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:22.320]   They will hack your phone as we saw. And in fact, a lot of journalists got away with that.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.400]   Only a couple of people were prosecuted and the amount of phone hacking that was going on. Well,
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:34.320]   you say phone hacking, it was guessing. Yeah, voicemail guessing the default thing on your
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.480]   voicemail, which is the last four digits of your phone number as standard. And most people didn't
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.440]   change that. It's still scummy practice. I wouldn't recommend it in the slightest. But, you know,
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:50.640]   British journals do have a reputation for being, you know, like a pit bull going after all liver.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:56.080]   I mean, it's just William L. Shire, the great American journalist who wrote the rise and fall
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.240]   a third right wrote about the British journalist. British reporters, correspondence and editors
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.600]   were so badly paid that many of them were forced to moonlighted side jobs in order to make ends meet.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.520]   I got to know a number of them and liked them, but they were rather an unhappy lot.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.320]   Since they had to write what their publishers dictated, they were a little ashamed of their jobs.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.800]   Over their cups in a pub, they used to recite a little jingle that was going the rounds in Fleet
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:24.480]   Street. You cannot buy or bribe or twist that saints the British journalist. But seeing what
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.080]   the man will do unbride, there's no occasion to.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:37.360]   Yeah. Well, I mean, there's a website and they do it. They now do a newsletter called popbitch.com,
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.400]   which is made up of journalists who put out the stories that they can't put in print because they
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:49.280]   get sued to Helen back. But I recommend that. But I mean, how does the UK do without the First Amendment?
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:54.080]   We often in the US think everybody has the First Amendment. No, it doesn't.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.280]   Well, no, the First Amendment only protects you against government regulation of speech.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:15:59.680]   Yeah. Exactly.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.800]   Or by the way, very important note in this time, peaceful protest is also protected by the First
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.600]   Amendment. Yeah. Right. For symbol. Yeah. But I mean, for us, it's it's down to the libel law. We have
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:15.920]   a very strange libel law where it is up to the person that wrote the article to prove their innocence
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.680]   rather than the opposition guilt. Yeah. You can't get you can't get legal aid for it. So you're on
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:27.760]   your own and libel cases can be very, very expensive. So you have to get good about
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:37.600]   implying hinting at all these things that you basically just got to get good at
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:45.120]   getting your point across without actually saying it. I mean, everyone knows that a certain member
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:52.800]   of the royal family is a disgusting individual with engraved habits. But you can't actually say
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:17:01.040]   that in Prince. You've merely got to him. You really have to say. You assume everybody knows it.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:06.640]   You just assume you just say this this Andy guys is not great and just maybe don't.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.920]   I wouldn't. He didn't even mention your name. He said no names. We are.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.560]   I'm not saying that he's part of the real family. I'm just commenting that some guy,
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.760]   Andrew guys. Andrew.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:19.120]   It's someone who's very keen on women's volleyball.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:25.760]   Although I did love the old Joe when Prince Charles got diagnosed with COVID.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:30.880]   It was like Prince Charles is hiding in bar moral with COVID-19. Andrew is hiding in Windsor with
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:42.160]   Emily 15. Oh, oh, oh, actually, as I remember, the Prince is being asked to testify in the
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:50.080]   US in the Epstein matter. He insists he wants to give every possible help to the US investigators
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.560]   besides actually coming to the US and giving them the. Yeah, exactly. That's just a problem,
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:01.200]   right? And also, I'm sure that after seeing the BBC interview, oh, yeah, there's no.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:07.920]   That wasn't well done on his part. I mean, so the DOJ has requested an interview with Prince Andrew
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.560]   as part of the Epstein matter. Federal prosecutors in the Manhattan US Attorney's office submitted
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:18.720]   it to the UK home office, but I would suspect that I remember the royal family is protected against
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:25.840]   any kind of requirement to come to the US. He never goes to the US and he's probably going to be okay.
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:31.680]   But, you know, Christine, that interview you brought up. It was just pathetic.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:37.200]   It was. It hurt him bad. Well, it's like, I don't sweat because I was in the Falklands Wall.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:43.280]   Remember, and therefore, I don't sweat. And I wasn't there that night because I took my daughter to
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:49.840]   a piece of espresso and quote. Oh, if you want a good giggle, go to the TripAdvisor of use for
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:54.640]   the pizza Express in Woking. It was just like, their hot pizza was great, but it didn't make me
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:04.320]   sweat. Pizza Express in Woking flooded with fake reviews.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.440]   Yeah. If you're in need of an alibi, this restaurant's for you.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:19.360]   Somehow, I just don't see Prince Andrew going there, but maybe, maybe, I mean, I'm a Republican
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.040]   with a small bar anyway. I don't believe the womb lottery is a good way of choosing your head of
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.080]   state. But in Prince Andrew's case, it's just like, get the guy out of here, you know,
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.120]   allow help the police with their inquiries and see what comes out of it because it's not like
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.080]   he's going to be king or anything. He just happens to be the Queen's favorite son.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:40.800]   Yeah. Exactly. She's just the one that he likes. He's just the one that she likes. That's it.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:47.040]   Yeah, pretty much. I mean, also, I've got to say this, and, you know, there's all the jokes about
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:53.360]   Prince Harry not being Charles's son and the rest of it. But if you look at the Queen's family,
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:20:01.040]   you've got Charles, tall, balding, and very tall and broad, Edward, quite tall and balding,
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.800]   Andrew, short squat, full head of hair.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:11.200]   Does it look just like dad? Is that what you're saying?
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:16.880]   I wouldn't dream. I wouldn't dream. Sorry, what was that?
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:22.800]   I said he's the only one who's got his hair. I mean, Harry, I've been very upset for Megan for years
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.840]   and been like, okay, now that they're in the US, get him like, get with the lawns hair guy and
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.240]   get him some propia or something. Well, I know because baldness, I'll have to ask you
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:37.040]   at prue about this, but I believe baldness comes down through the matrilineal line. Yes.
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:45.840]   That's what they say. That's what they say. I totally disagree. No one on my maternal side is
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:50.160]   bald. Really? Everyone on my dad's side is. There you go. So maybe.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.760]   Okay. Because you see, my mum, I went back for Christmas a couple of years ago with a classic
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.160]   case of tact. Mum looked to me on Christmas day off. I can bottle of wine and said,
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:04.000]   you look just like my father. And he losing your hair in the same place as well.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.720]   Thanks, mum. Great. Thank you. Well, I flew all this way.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:14.320]   For Christmas. You know, you've got to have a British Christmas. I mean, American Christmas
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.000]   is a fine. You guys know. But these Christmases are drunken food
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.640]   frenzies. And I highly recommend them. I will never forget my first taste of plum pudding with
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:30.640]   hard sauce. Oh, I can still taste. Yeah. Okay. It sits in the stomach like a cannonball, but, you know,
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:39.520]   actually it is a cannonball. That was a divorce. Me. Those are the best me. I know. You wanted
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:45.280]   to sit in your stomach like a cannonball. Absolutely. That's how you know you ate it. That's right.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:53.920]   Our show today brought to you by a fine sponsor that you all know very well. I sleep on this sponsor.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:02.880]   Every night. I'm talking about my Casper mattress. I love my Casper. It's an online retailer.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:09.200]   A premium mattress is they all they invented this whole idea of eliminating the middleman.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:13.680]   The they were one of the very first direct to consumer companies. They the Casper founders
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:20.080]   understood that in the mattress business, the price you pay half of that goes to that mattress
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:26.640]   store that's they market up so much that that you're paying for the privilege of a couple of
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.680]   minutes lying on a mattress in a brightly lit store. That's the whole deal. That's the whole deal.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.440]   So if they could just eliminate that store, they could cut their prices by a lot. That's exactly
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:43.920]   what they did. They make amazing mattresses. They come in an amazingly compact box that in that
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:50.480]   box that I'm opening right now. That is a king size mattress. It's a fantastic mattress. The
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:56.160]   original Casper combines multiple supportive memory foams for a quality sleep surface with just the
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.720]   right amount of sink and bounce and it's a breathable. All the Casper mattresses breathe.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:07.040]   So you sleep cool, really important because it turns out a cool sleep means you'll sleep better.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:13.120]   I'm opening right now the hybrid. This combines the pressure relief of the award-winning foam.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:18.000]   They're famous for with durable springs. They also have the Casper essential if you're buying
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.920]   when I bought mattress for my son in his college dorm. The essential, perfect streamline design
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.320]   and a price it won't keep you up at night. In fact, it was so affordable after four years.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:31.920]   We said, "Henry, just leave it there. We'll get you a new mattress when you move home."
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:37.440]   The Wave Love This One features a patent-pending premium support system to mirror the natural
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:43.280]   shape of your body. That course Casper also has the best pillows and sheets that glow light.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:51.040]   Look, even Sammy loves our Casper mattress. Sammy did not review it, although there are 20,000 reviews
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:56.160]   an average of 4.8 stars on the Casper site Amazon and Google. It is fast becoming the
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:00.800]   Internet's favorite mattress. My favorite mattress, Sammy loves that mattress too.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:08.480]   You'll love your Casper now, you might say, but I want to pay twice as much so I could spend
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:13.520]   three minutes in a mattress store trying before I buy. You don't have to because Casper invented
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:20.800]   this too. They give you 100 nights to sleep on your mattress. It's absolutely risk-free. A 100
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:27.360]   night sleep on it trial. Free shipping, painless returns to the US and Canada. If any time in those
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.480]   first 100 days, you say, "Maybe it's not for me." They'll come and get it. You don't have to fit it
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.560]   back in that box. I promise. They'll come and get it and they'll refund you every penny.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:43.280]   I bought one a couple months ago because our bed was just pretty craptastic apparently.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.720]   The missus was not going to go to bed with me at night anymore. It's always for the missus,
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:54.480]   isn't it? Yes. I'm not doing this anymore. Never mind the fact that she had been pissed off at me
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.080]   for a work or two or something. I say it or didn't say it or do you or didn't do it.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:06.960]   But I did get the Casper and Holy Moly that did is freaking awesome.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.840]   I love it. In years back, I've gone and bought a very, I won't say the name,
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:18.000]   very expensive mattress at a mattress store. By the way, when you get it home, just air it out
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.760]   for a few days before you sleep on it. That was the old style. It's terrible. Casper, no.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:32.400]   I don't know how they do it. It smells great. It doesn't smell like a mattress. It's normal.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.440]   You can use it right away. Unlike the even more expensive mattresses from the mattress store,
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:47.920]   no off-gassing. It's a wonderful mattress. Right now, you can save $100 off select mattress.

[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.240]   helps us a little bit. We had a fun week this week. I don't know if they got the best,
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.120]   the Christina Warren in the match and the not-the-match game.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:23.440]   She's legendary at this game. She's so good. I love the game.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.040]   And Ann, thank you for helping me get the win. That was the best.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:30.160]   Oh, yeah. Oh, it's just to Ann. Pro it. Let's watch.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:37.840]   Previously on "Twit". The bonus round, it's just Apple blank.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.600]   I went with that iPhone.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.200]   Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, iPhone.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:43.600]   And...
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:49.280]   Oh, sorry. You wrote sucks.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.240]   You wrote all about Android.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:56.480]   So what you're looking at is the Razer Kishin. Razer had an event and they were showing off
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.720]   a gamepad controller for Android. And this is it.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.640]   Hands-on photography. I've been getting a lot of emails just asking a similar question.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.920]   Oh, versus JPEG.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.000]   Twit news.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:16.400]   Today we are following closely Sony's big event, the future of gaming.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:21.200]   I think what we saw today was pretty exciting. There's a lot of really cool looking games and
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:27.040]   the hardware itself much bolder design than I would have ever expected from Sony.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.040]   iOS today.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.160]   Why is there something there's like a fish on my head?
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.440]   Looks like my new F-cap. Wow.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.200]   I'm leaning on my bike a plug.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:37.840]   So am I!
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.400]   Let's ride!
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.640]   What's our back of game call?
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.920]   Bug ugly.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:48.400]   Twits. Unbelievable as always.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.600]   That was disturbing.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.920]   Although who does it say respect and the Apple sucks thing would have been my response.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.680]   Yeah, good, isn't it?
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.040]   I just spoke from the heart.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:27:59.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.160]   You're obviously an Android level.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:02.800]   I apologize.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:08.480]   Actually speaking of disloyalty after I saw that PS5 review, which by the way,
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.280]   Jeff Kanata, thank you for doing that with Jason L.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.960]   My old friend Jeff who's getting a little gray, Jeff.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.520]   I thought I'm an Xbox guy.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.440]   I thought I'm getting a PS5 this fall.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.560]   I'm not getting an Xbox.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:23.600]   I'm sorry, Christina.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.240]   Don't forgive me.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.920]   I mean, look, I'm for the new Spider-Man alone.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.600]   Doesn't that look awesome?
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.480]   Looks amazing.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.440]   And my friend Evan worked on it, which when we found that out,
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.000]   because he kept it quiet, we were all like, all right.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.040]   So no, I mean, it looks great.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:44.000]   I actually just got the Xbox One X, which I know it's stupid to buy it at the end of the cycle.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.720]   But the Cyberpunk 2077 edition became available and it just is beautiful.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.320]   And so, yeah.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.160]   I was the first station.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:54.800]   I love it.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.880]   I have not playing the Cyberpunk game.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.680]   Do you like it?
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.440]   Well, the game is not out yet.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.800]   So this is the hilarity.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:03.120]   So the game has been delayed until like the fall,
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:08.960]   but the limited edition console came out and it's just that the design is like really, really good.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.560]   So it will include the game when the game inevitably is released,
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.800]   but until then it's just, you know.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.840]   And I love it.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.200]   Spider-Man is black.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.320]   Miles Moravas.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.520]   I think that's fantastic.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.000]   And he's finally got a decent haircut, by the way.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.800]   Previous versions.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.240]   The hair wasn't quite natural, but I think they've...
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.280]   This really looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:33.360]   I can't wait to play the video games.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.320]   I was a Sony PlayStation guide.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.400]   The last thing I had was the PS3.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.160]   But hard hits.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:43.120]   They like X-bots were one in particular.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.720]   So we have the X-bots one.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.360]   You have both.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:49.680]   And the other one has, I think it's the S or one S.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.320]   I don't know.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.320]   There's the S, there's the X.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:55.520]   To be fair.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:56.080]   The first one.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.320]   The next generation X-box.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.400]   The series X looks great too.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.240]   But I just use it for my home entertainment.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.160]   It's pretty much my television.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.520]   This is the Xbox one.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.000]   I don't...
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.520]   That's why I'm getting the PS5.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.800]   Because it has a UHD,
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.800]   one of the versions has a UHD drive in it.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.520]   And that's what I want.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.960]   I want to be able to play my Blu-rays.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.680]   I think Microsoft, do they...
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.400]   I think they don't have the drive?
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:20.960]   No, they do.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.520]   They do.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.160]   Mine does.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.320]   No, I know the X-bots.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.520]   The X-bots is on.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.480]   The current one does.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.920]   The series X will have it as well.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.120]   Because I think at this point,
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.920]   that was actually my only criticism of the PS5.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.720]   It's weird to me that they're coming out with a digital version
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.720]   and a version with a disc.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.920]   Because to me, I'm like,
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.120]   "Okay, I get that you don't want to have discs
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:45.440]   that you want to just put the final nail in GameStop's coffin
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.400]   and you want to sell directly and whatnot."
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.320]   But if the market isn't ready to do that,
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.080]   and it isn't for a lot of reasons,
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.360]   internet isn't great everywhere.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.680]   Some people have bandwidth caps
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:59.360]   and you're talking about like,
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.840]   gears is like 100 gigabyte download, right?
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.400]   These are substantial things.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.280]   It makes sense to still distribute things on disc.
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:10.400]   But if you're not ready to go all in on digital,
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.680]   it just seems weird to me to have both versions available at launch,
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.560]   especially when the digital version isn't any smaller.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.320]   And I'm going to come out and predict this.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.520]   I don't know anything.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.000]   But I would be very, very, very surprised
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.680]   if it was much less expensive.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.280]   So...
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.480]   It's skier.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.600]   It doesn't have that lip.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.480]   Well, it's like...
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:33.040]   Yeah, but it's the same width, right?
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:33.600]   Right.
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.680]   It's not going to take up less room on your shelf.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.640]   It's really not.
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:39.040]   So it's weird to me to release both.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.840]   I feel like go all in or don't.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.840]   Because we know what's going to happen
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.720]   when they have their first revision a couple of years.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.760]   That's when they'll drop the disc, which is fine.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.600]   But if you're not ready to do that yet,
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.960]   it just seems weird to me to have two different SKUs,
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.560]   two different production lines.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:02.640]   Is that just a way of keeping it from being a exclusivity issue
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.600]   where they sort of hit your bit and allowed everybody in?
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   Oh, and so Blu-ray...
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.920]   And Sony owns a Blu-ray UHD spec.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.320]   So if they didn't put a disc in,
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:14.560]   it would be a tacit admission that there's no future for Blu-ray.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:19.120]   I guess my point is why do a digital version at all is my point?
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:19.920]   Like it's not...
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:22.720]   Oh, I got you because the phone factor is the same.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.680]   Right, exactly.
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.400]   I'm saying if you're not ready to do what you really want to do,
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.000]   which is drop the disc,
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.560]   then why not just wait the two years
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.880]   and drop the disc next time anyway?
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.640]   Because Sony has the history of that, right?
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.880]   Like the PS3, the first one had backward compatibility.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.320]   The next one didn't.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.280]   They do that all the time or they will take features away.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.640]   So the audience will be annoyed, but they won't be surprised.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.360]   So it's just weird to me to have two of them at the beginning.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.960]   It seems like they're just AB testing,
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:51.680]   and it's like you don't have the strength in your convictions
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:54.400]   to either do what you really want to do,
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.600]   or to suck it up and defeat the market's not ready.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.800]   Do you still go to GameStop?
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:03.840]   Did you buy an animal crossing car?
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.400]   I actually did, yes.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.560]   Because I have two switches and...
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.680]   Oh, you have to switch.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:10.640]   Or for you to play them,
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:12.000]   you have to have the game on each,
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.520]   and you can't buy multiple things.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.640]   And I think for used games,
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.000]   like I'll still occasionally do that.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.040]   That's the reason.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.960]   And I think that's also the reason Sony hates it.
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.880]   And that's the reason Michael,
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.120]   our son still goes to GameStop.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.440]   He wants to sell the used discs, right?
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.360]   There's no real advantage to a disc,
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.760]   because, as soon as you put the disc in,
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.040]   you download 50 gigabytes worth of crap anyway.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:33.760]   It's not like...
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.640]   Yeah, like DLC.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.160]   Like you don't have to download the whole game anyway.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.200]   Exactly.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.160]   No, I mean, Sony and all the console makers
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.760]   hate the physical things, I think, right?
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.760]   Like they would all love to just go directly to them.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.200]   To use to market for one thing.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.720]   No, because they don't get anything from it.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.000]   I understand that,
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.760]   and I understand consumers like it.
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.720]   What I'm saying, though,
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.080]   is that most of us at this point,
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:57.600]   like, buy our games digitally,
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.440]   because it's just faster and easier.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.040]   And it would be great if you could download your disc
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.160]   legally onto your system,
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.520]   if there was some sort of fingerprint thing,
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.360]   and then you could get the best of both worlds.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.760]   But when a company tried to say that,
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.600]   that would be an idea last generation.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.880]   It's a constant question.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.160]   Said your console has to...
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:14.800]   No, no, no.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.200]   When they said your console has to be connected
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.640]   to the internet all the time,
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.880]   then people rolled and freaked out.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:21.920]   And so we lost that.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.080]   Now that I'm bitter,
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.200]   seven years later,
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:29.120]   I have to deal with discs occasionally.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.440]   Like, Spiderman is actually one example.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.600]   Like, I have to always put it in when I want to play the game,
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.880]   because it came with my gifts.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.400]   You know, it's like, sorry.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.680]   Yeah, I don't like this.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.960]   We're back to CRM again, though.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:39.840]   But that's the reason.
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.880]   Yeah, that's the other reason.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.760]   The same problem.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.160]   I actually am reading like a bit of a luddite.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.960]   And this is a shameful thing to admit on this show,
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.800]   but I've never owned a console.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.720]   Have any kind.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.600]   I've always been facing master race.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.560]   This is why you write so well,
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.200]   and you're at the...
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.240]   Yeah, you're at the...
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.800]   Is your idea of a good game,
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:02.320]   a brisk hand of cribbage?
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:02.960]   What is it that...
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.240]   No, no, no, no.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:04.800]   No, no, no, no.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.600]   It's not me.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.160]   Because in Britain,
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.120]   you guys had the amigas,
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.440]   and you had like the Zedd,
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.240]   whatever, right?
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.120]   Like you have the...
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:12.400]   Oh, the same players in the BBC,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.600]   the Acon.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.240]   The spectrum.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.120]   I mean, when I first started playing games,
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.720]   you loaded them with cassette tape.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.200]   It was on those little things.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.720]   And you fixed around with the...
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.160]   (imitates a sound)
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.160]   Yeah, so the software would load.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.160]   But honestly, give me a PC.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.200]   I mean, for...
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.600]   For Doom, for Duke Nukem,
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.160]   for Civ 2, for Age of Empires.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.720]   These are all better done through a keyboard.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:35.360]   And yeah, okay,
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.360]   you've got to upgrade your hardware occasionally.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.880]   But I just hate the idea of buying a dumb computer.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.360]   I know this is a lot like thing to say,
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.400]   but it just keeps me...
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.360]   No, no, I think that's not...
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:46.400]   I think that actually...
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.440]   It was actually interesting,
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.480]   is that both the PS5
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.320]   and the Xbox Series X
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.240]   are going in that direction, right?
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.000]   Where they are basically computers.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.640]   But it's in a console form factor.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.000]   And I mean, look,
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000]   I think most people would agree
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.200]   that if you were wanting to do
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.480]   like most competitive gamers,
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.200]   most other things,
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.440]   like unless you're really into exclusives
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.880]   for a certain console,
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:09.920]   you know, most hardcore gamers are PC gamers.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.440]   I personally am just...
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.280]   I've grown up using controllers.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.200]   And that's just how I like to play my games.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.200]   Some games are better with controllers.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.200]   Yeah, but I do totally...
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.320]   I don't think you're being a ludite,
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:21.520]   if anything, I think actually.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.400]   Like, it's interesting.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.040]   We've had this kind of rise in PC gaming
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.400]   and people building their own systems
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.440]   and buying that sort of thing.
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.160]   And I think that's been led by the fact that,
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.040]   you know, to get the best graphics and best advantages
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.840]   and the cutting-edge stuff that's all happening on a PC.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:36.640]   So much work.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.160]   You got to get the right video card.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.440]   You got to get the drivers
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.640]   and the drivers don't work.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.560]   Oh, that's part of the fun.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.080]   You know, it's fun.
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:44.720]   It's fun?
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.120]   No, no, no.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.720]   I mean, it's just like,
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.160]   you know, it's part...
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.360]   It's the end of the struggle
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.640]   between more power and more,
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.800]   you know, more power and more software grown.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.320]   But it has given benefits.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.800]   There was a great example of the US Navy
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.040]   where they were spending a million...
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.720]   I think it sounded like a million dollars
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:07.040]   on submarine torpedo targeting tracking devices.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.760]   And they just replaced it with an Xbox controller
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.920]   because that's what people have grown up with.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.000]   And they've saved themselves a fortune
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.640]   and the, you know, the Navy personnel prefer it.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.200]   So, you know, I get consoles are fun.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.440]   And I get the hand-nug controller thing is fun.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.480]   I'm just an old-fashioned guy and I like a keyboard, you know.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.360]   It's like, I want increments done on a keystroke,
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.600]   not just like yank it one way or the other.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.560]   Actually, there is a text angle to that as well,
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.200]   another tech angle because the Navy moved to touch screens
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.240]   for its control.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:43.520]   And you remember the McCain had a fatal accident
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.840]   and it came down to the fact that they had two helmsmen,
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.360]   one in the front, one in the back.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:50.320]   And they couldn't really use the touch screens very well.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.360]   So the Navy is actually going back to physical throttles.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.440]   Like joysticks and steering wheels.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.880]   And because the touchscreen was so complex,
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.760]   sailors lost control of the ship.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.480]   I couldn't say when the Dragon capsule launched up to the ISS
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.360]   earlier on, the SpaceX capsule,
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.760]   and I saw they were just using touch screens,
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.480]   I was kind of like, you know, I kind of like physical controls.
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:19.840]   That made me very nervous.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.280]   If you're a max-q vibration going up through the atmosphere,
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:25.280]   do you really want someone in a spacesuit
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.200]   trying to push the right button, you know,
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.880]   give them some physical controls?
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.360]   I did. I mentioned that and somebody said to me
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.600]   that the touch screens are just a backup system.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.440]   And while they will use that,
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.040]   they also have switches effect.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.120]   I really thought this was hysterical.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.360]   In your car, I don't know if you know this,
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.720]   there is a handle, not for the driver,
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.080]   but for the passengers.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.280]   That Lisa calls the "Oh, crap handle."
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:54.720]   You grab whenever Lisa is driving,
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.600]   anyway, I grab.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:02.320]   And that's kind of what they built an old crap handle
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.680]   into the space vehicle,
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.120]   because there is a handle in front of them.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:08.080]   I don't know if you noticed this in front of the two astronauts,
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.720]   and they can hold onto it while they're going like this,
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.160]   and there's physical switches on it that they can control.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.080]   Oh, wow, I didn't notice that.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.800]   So I thought that was actually good.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.040]   Industrial design.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.120]   It's that mental ratio and saying it's kind of like
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.240]   when I'm driving with my mum and I'm sitting in the passenger seat,
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.760]   and if she has to slam the brakes on,
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:30.480]   she will thrust her arm out like that to hold me back.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.080]   Yes, my dad used to do that.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:32.640]   That's going to work.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.880]   My mum does that.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.760]   My mum always.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:37.040]   My sister does cheer.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:38.640]   That's a parent move.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.880]   Like you can stop a 180 ball,
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:45.840]   pound cannonball from going through that window.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.120]   Like, stick in your arm.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.800]   Oh, come on.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:52.800]   I mean, I get the feeling as really lovely that they do it,
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.960]   but come on, let's don't get ourselves on this.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.680]   Ant had a good point.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:59.120]   I think Ant's arm would work.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.320]   That'd be a good point.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.120]   It could do it.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.000]   It could do it.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:02.560]   Look at that.
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.400]   My arm would go like that.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.640]   That's better than the bar on a roller coaster, Ant.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.240]   That I would feel safer.
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:08.960]   Hold on to that.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:09.600]   Sorry.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.040]   And you've got biceps that are thicker than my neck for goodness.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:17.600]   That's like, I'm respect to you for doing it, but it just.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.080]   Highly recommend, if you want to look like Ant Pro,
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:21.520]   at least that's my hope,
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.240]   the hands-on wellness on the TRX workout at home.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.120]   I'm going to end up looking like you in weeks, right, Ant?
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.320]   I give you months, sir.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.200]   That works months.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.280]   Yes, there.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.600]   Christina weeks, you months.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:36.560]   It makes me okay.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.480]   No, I love hands-on wellness, by the way.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:41.760]   You're doing a great job.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.840]   And I love the hero picture from the website.
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.720]   If you look at that, you go,
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.400]   "Yeah, I think he might know about wellness."
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.520]   He might actually,
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.560]   but the most recent one,
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.520]   I love also the hero picture of the TRX 80.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.560]   Wow.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   I just have fun with some of this.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.800]   Hell yeah, no, that's good.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:01.760]   That's very good.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.240]   Do you do your own Photoshop for those?
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.280]   Yes, sir.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.800]   It's not a TRX 80.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.480]   It's a combination between me and Mr. Victor.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.840]   We both sort of tag team,
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.640]   but the last couple I've just sort of done myself.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.080]   It's a TRX.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:14.960]   The TRX 80,
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:16.800]   I think I'm confusing that with a TRX 80.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.040]   It's just TRX 80.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.080]   There's no 80.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.640]   No 80.
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.280]   There's no 80 involved.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.600]   And I want to talk about Apple,
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.680]   WWDC, the rumor mill.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.080]   You can just say it all sucks.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:32.720]   It all sucks.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:33.280]   It all sucks.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.320]   I respect Apple.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.160]   Apple has done some amazing things
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.960]   from the industrial design side of it.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.240]   And just the way they handle standards with security,
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.840]   I give them credit for that.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.360]   I just don't like the Apple tax.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.080]   It comes along with it.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.080]   It's no TRX 80, but it's okay.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.760]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.400]   Aunt Prud's here from Hands-On Photography, Hands-On Wellness.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:00.320]   Christina Warren is here from Microsoft,
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.080]   Channel 9, Senior Cloud Advocate.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.880]   Are you, they're not going to do the tours again for a while,
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:05.600]   I would imagine.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.640]   You were on the road at once.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.200]   Probably not.
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:07.760]   Probably not.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:11.760]   We're all allowed to work from home until at least October.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.640]   So I don't know when that will be starting again.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.880]   Good. Stay home, stay safe.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.400]   Ian Thompson also,
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.240]   who would normally be sitting right next to me,
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:23.200]   sharing a little tipple with me.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.440]   But I'm sorry.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.040]   I mean, there's a British pub on the way to Petaluma,
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.480]   which I'm missing an awful lot.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:28.880]   I know.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.240]   I've got your Scotch egg.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.840]   He's going through Scotch egg withdrawal.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.320]   Oh, well, that's not possible.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.520]   I want to try a Scotch egg.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.160]   Oh, you've got to do it seriously.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.480]   Probably should just, I guess I could do it at home.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.360]   I know how to her mate.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.400]   I should probably do it at home.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.040]   Yeah, you could make it home.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.960]   But stay away from the bacon butt.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.480]   He needs a deep fat fry though,
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.240]   and I've always found those rather wasteful,
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.080]   because basically you've got a sauce
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.080]   but the fat that doesn't do anything for a while.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.200]   Yeah, no, that's a good part.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.480]   Yeah, good Scotch egg.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.600]   Oh, thing of beauty.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:59.520]   Basically, it's a hard boiled egg wrapped with sausage.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:03.040]   Sausage meat, and then covered in breadcrumbs and fried.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.480]   Sounds awesome.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.480]   That doesn't mean the average death rating Glasgow is 52.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.560]   Oh my god.
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:16.720]   And bacon, what are they?
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.520]   Bacon buns?
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.240]   Bacon bunnies?
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:18.800]   What are they called?
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:19.680]   Bacon bunnies.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.320]   Bunnies.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.120]   Proper bacon, by the way,
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:26.640]   which is a strip of meat with a strip of fat on the side,
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:29.040]   not a fat strip with optional pork,
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:32.480]   which is bright, subtle, extent of the pork.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.160]   I will fight you to the death side.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.960]   I'm sorry, mate.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.480]   You and I are going to have to have a half of that.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.360]   Bacon bunnies are disgusting.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.960]   Oh god.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.160]   You never lived mad.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.200]   Seriously.
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.400]   Sorry.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.640]   This pandemic stuff has got to go.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.960]   Me and this cat, we gots to hook up.
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.400]   Oh yeah.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.280]   He should take you on a British food tour.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.400]   I mean, thick slices of white bread,
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.960]   smearing with margarine and tomato ketchup,
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.080]   put bacon on them.
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:04.640]   If you're feeling really good, put chips on them as well.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:04.960]   Sorry.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.400]   French fries.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:07.840]   French fries.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.240]   So bacon and chips are crisp in Britain.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:14.720]   I mean, it's just food with a gods man.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.280]   Admittedly, the gods that die only through heart disease, but you know.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.200]   Don't put margarine on it.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:21.840]   Don't please.
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.720]   I think of you.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.160]   You spotter.
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.200]   It's okay.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:25.840]   It's okay.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.120]   I showed it.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:31.520]   It's glad to have you too, Ian, from the register.com.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.040]   Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:41.360]   Nobody at this point is anxious to go to the post office to buy stamps or to mail packages.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.800]   Fortunately, you don't need to because you can do everything you would do at the US Postal
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.880]   Service from your desk.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:54.000]   And now not just the US Postal Service, UPS as well.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.920]   Stamps.com is a boon.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.600]   We've been using it for, I think, 10 years in the office.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.880]   It's fantastic.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:03.440]   I use it at home now too because I need stamps.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.560]   I print them out from my computer with my print and no special link.
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:07.520]   No postage meter.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:09.600]   Just stamps.com.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.600]   You can print postage on demand.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.720]   You can get discounts.
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:14.720]   You won't even get at the post office.
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.880]   US Postal Service, but also now United Parcel Service, UPS.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:23.920]   UPS with discounts up to 62%.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:32.800]   I didn't know this, but if you send UPS to a house, to a residence, and I guess everybody
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:38.400]   who sells on Etsy or Amazon or eBay knows this already, they charge you a surcharge like $5 extra,
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:40.480]   not with stamps.com.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.680]   No residential surcharge.
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:43.040]   They negotiated that with UPS.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:50.160]   If you are selling stuff online, if you're shipping stuff, you've got to have stamps.com.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:53.040]   We've been using them at Twitch since 2012.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.080]   And if you aren't using them, what are you waiting for?
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:02.160]   Stamps.com brings all the services of the US Postal Service right to your computer in the safety
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.800]   and comfort of your own home or wherever you're hunkering down right now.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:11.600]   For a small business, if you're sending out invoices or brochures, if you're an online seller,
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.440]   shipping products, if you're just working from home and you need to mail stuff,
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.160]   it's easy.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.680]   Stamps.com is easy.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.560]   You can use your own computer, your own printer, you can print your own stamps,
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:27.440]   your own postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail, anywhere you want to send
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.960]   and now with UPS as well.
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:31.680]   Now, the beauty part is you don't have to get up from the desk.
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:34.480]   Once your mail is ready, you leave it for the mail carrier.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.920]   Or you could schedule a free package pickup.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:40.560]   You could drop it in the mailbox if you feel like taking a walk.
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:42.640]   No human contact required.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:44.240]   It's just that simple.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:47.840]   I mean, this is the time if you've been waiting to get stamps.com.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:51.440]   And I'm telling you that this counts five cents off every first class stamp,
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:57.520]   five cents off every first class stamp, up to 62% off shipping rates.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.760]   Stamps.com comes with a USB scale.
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.960]   You plug it right into the computer.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.600]   It'll even suggest a better rate.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:04.160]   Is that a book?
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.960]   You could do it by media mail, saves you money that way too.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:09.440]   Stamps.com is a no-brainer.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:10.960]   It saves you time.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.080]   It saves you money and helps keep you safe in these crazy times.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.320]   And like I said, we have been using it.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.360]   Actually, they've been advertising with us since 2012.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:20.800]   I've been using it longer than that.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.960]   I know it's been at least 10 years.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.480]   I love stamps.com.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.480]   Right now we've got an amazing offer.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.480]   I want you to take advantage of this.

[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.320]   No, there's only one way to get this though.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:02.000]   This is not the offer on the front page.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.200]   You've got to go to stamps.com.

[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.920]   I've been working with them for so long.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:18.080]   stamps.com offer code is TWIT.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.400]   I don't think they're the longest advertiser on TWIT,
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.200]   but they're one of them.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:25.280]   And they've been on the radio show.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:27.280]   That's why they've been on the radio show even longer.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.800]   I've been doing their ads forever.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.360]   Yeah, I love them.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.440]   stamps.com.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.440]   Ian Thompson is now in the chat room.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:41.200]   Our chat room is so hilarious.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.760]   It says forget waffles, go for bubble and squeak.
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:51.280]   I've learned if you really want to fire up the chat room, talk apple, talk lennets.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.160]   Oh good.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.120]   Let's do it right now.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.480]   Let's fire up.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:57.200]   We're talking British Bakers at the moment.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.400]   So are they in favor of the bacon butty?
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.080]   It's actually we're talking about it's fry ups because in America,
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:11.280]   go for hash browns or waffles, whereas traditional British bubble and squeak.
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.160]   So that's mashed potato and cooked cabbage fried.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:16.720]   Need it.
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.200]   Need it.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.840]   I'm with you, Christine.
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:20.800]   Prefer-peefy.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:21.280]   Oh my god.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:21.760]   Oh my god.
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:22.880]   Oh my god.
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.800]   Oh my god.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.480]   I don't want my food to make noise.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:29.680]   No, no.
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.000]   Bubble and squeak, eggs, bacon, sausage,
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.600]   black pudding, fried mushrooms,
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.840]   liver and onions if you're feeling really good.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.920]   You know, that is the classic fry up.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.360]   Oh, oh I get it.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:42.240]   The bubbling and squeak is not coming from the food, it's coming from you.
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.600]   After you eat it.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:46.320]   That comes about four hours later.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:54.240]   So while the stock market has been a little cuckoo over the last few months,
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.720]   a little, a little crazy.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:58.400]   It's up one day down the other day.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:49:59.920]   It's just crazy.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.440]   Apple has taken advantage of this.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:06.080]   Apple is a hot commodity.
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.560]   They are now very close to, if not at,
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.240]   one and a half trillion dollars in market cap.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:14.560]   Unbelievable.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.800]   Unbelievable.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.040]   When it comes to what Amm was saying,
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:22.080]   I mean, we call it the Cupertino Idiot text.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.440]   You know, you are massively overpaying the hard word that you buy.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.920]   And Apple will have fine with that.
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:30.960]   You know, it's just like, give us your money, suckers.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:34.480]   Oh, and if you want to pay, just buy new kids.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:35.280]   We're going to try.
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:39.280]   And I will say as one of those suckers, we're fine to pay it.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:42.400]   Like in most cases, I'm like, all right, that's fine.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.520]   I'll take the trade off.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.920]   I just wish I had bought Apple stock at its low, which is March 23rd.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.640]   With all of the stock market was down to 224 bucks.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:55.040]   It is now more than a hundred worth a hundred dollars more, 338 bucks.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:56.240]   What was I thinking?
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.880]   I wish I bought it in 1998.
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.720]   I mean, okay, if we're wishing.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.160]   That was really good for us.
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:05.840]   If we're wishing, 98 would have been a good year to buy.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.240]   But really, there is nothing really to celebrate.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:12.320]   I mean, look, the stock market has nothing to do with fundamentals.
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:12.960]   I've learned that.
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:14.880]   But what would you celebrate with Apple?
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:20.000]   Do they don't have anything really new?
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.520]   Maybe this augmented reality glasses next year.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:23.920]   Come on.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:27.920]   I mean, we've invented new airports, and that's it.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:33.280]   Since 2011, pretty much, that's all the new stuff they've invented.
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:36.000]   I mean, okay, there was the butterfly keyboard, which did work.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:36.560]   The keyboard?
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:41.120]   They have watched the light strip, which didn't work.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.000]   Yeah, but it was to wear one of those things.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.280]   How about the home pod?
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:50.000]   It's like literally like tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people,
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.040]   like where the Apple watch.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.040]   No, I wear it now on a new day.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:54.080]   I do a word every day.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:58.240]   But what does it do to you that a smartphone can't?
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:51:59.600]   No, that's the point.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:00.400]   It's not a smartphone.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.280]   It's on my right side.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.040]   Also, it makes people tremendously rude,
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:10.320]   because whenever you watch Vibrase, the automatic thing is to look at it.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:13.840]   And if you're in a conversation with someone and you're looking at your watch,
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:17.440]   that's the equivalent of saying, "Buggaroff, I've got other things to do with my life."
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:17.680]   Right.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:23.120]   You know, it just, I'm not sold on SmartWatch's.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.880]   The earbuds are cute.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:30.480]   But really, since the iPad, they haven't come up with anything that's really game-changing.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:34.880]   Christina, you and I are going to just split off from this program.
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:41.280]   They haven't done anything like game-changing or what have you,
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:44.720]   but they do a damn good job with their laptops.
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:49.360]   Just run is so super efficient on lower spec hardware.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:52.480]   They don't have all of the gazillion gigs of RAM.
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:58.960]   And typically, they don't always have the upper echelon Intel CPU in it.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:03.600]   But yet, the thing runs like a freaking beast where on the Windows side,
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:11.200]   I have to put in at least 32 gigs of RAM and a decent SSD and have some type of high-end chip.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:14.400]   And then you have to run Windows, which no one should have to run.
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:17.520]   I was going to say, grab yourself some Linux, mate.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.960]   Obviously, it's the way forward.
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.440]   Linux.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.080]   I mean, okay.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:27.680]   Now, obviously, it's based on Linux, but it's just, and I do admire the fact that Apple can,
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:33.760]   because they own the whole hardware ecosystem, they can make their stuff run really, really well.
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.360]   And you've got to respect that.
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:38.160]   But they charge a stupid amount of money for it.
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:40.880]   And they don't make it easy to repair and update.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:46.880]   So... No, but I have to say, though, to be fair, no PC maker anymore makes it easy to fix my
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:53.120]   talks. I mean, Dell is maybe the one exception if you get like the XPS 13 or 15 or whatever,
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:56.160]   because you can do some of your ability to yourself.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.520]   Yeah, I've created my hardware.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.800]   But the RAM... Nice piece of pizza.
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:53:59.680]   Nice, but it can't.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:01.200]   Oh, I love my XPS 13.
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.680]   But the RAM is soldered in, more and more stuff soldered in.
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:07.120]   Lenovo, which used to make these think pads used to be, you could everything.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.120]   You could change the keyboard, the track.
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:11.120]   Everything's soldered, starting to be soldered down.
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:13.840]   Apple started this by making everything so thin.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:19.120]   And in order to make these super compact, thin laptops, you just have to change how you
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:19.760]   manufacture it.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.320]   Exactly.
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.200]   You can just solder things in.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:22.960]   You have to make the batteries different.
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:26.000]   And look, I don't disagree with some of what you're saying, Ian.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.760]   I mean, I think that you're not completely wrong.
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:32.640]   But I also think that there is something to be said about just something just working.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:37.360]   I think this is why the keyboard was so problematic and was such a disappointment for so long,
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:39.680]   because that was just a massive fail.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.400]   But it just works.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:41.440]   You don't have to worry about things.
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:46.400]   You can have a laptop for a really long time and it'll keep doing what you want it to do.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.000]   I mean, you know, and frankly, like there are good Android phones out there.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.840]   I'm not trying to say that there aren't, but it's really hard to get a better smartphone than an
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.720]   iPhone. It just is.
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:55.680]   I agree.
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:56.880]   You know, when you're looking at all it.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:57.440]   It just works too.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:58.560]   Yeah, I just...
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.160]   We'll get the screen cameras.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:01.280]   We'll just release two.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:07.040]   Android 11, in public beta, I put it on my Pixel 4, which is,
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:10.720]   you know, arguably, you know, the top of the line, one of the top of the line anyway,
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:11.520]   Android devices.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.400]   And it does run bad.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:15.040]   I have to say Android 11, it actually runs a little bit better.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.000]   Oh, God.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:16.720]   That's good to hear.
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.800]   I've got to say, it runs better.
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:20.880]   But have you found this as well?
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:25.440]   I funny, my Android is now chewing battery life at a very high rate of money.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.240]   Mine is too.
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:28.160]   Normally, I would get...
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.800]   Yeah, I would normally get to roughly 9 p.m. at night before I even
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:36.800]   think about having to charge my battery, because it normally ran really, really
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.120]   well. But nowadays, not even close.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:39.840]   With updates.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:40.240]   No, no.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.720]   Because people are complaining that the latest iOS 13 point, what is it?
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.240]   Fifth, I can never remember.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.240]   Yeah, 13.5, I guess.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:50.480]   That 5.1 is killing battery life.
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.600]   Yeah, 50% of the jailbreak.
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.080]   Yeah, the jailbreak fix is killing battery life, too.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.040]   So there must...
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:55.680]   I mean, these are...
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.360]   I think this is a back and forth thing that they fix, and then they break.
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:00.640]   Although I did love...
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.400]   Have you seen Nokia has now released the 31.10 again?
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.000]   Oh, how many?
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.760]   The classic candy by phone.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:14.000]   Yeah, you can buy it for 35 quid in American, what that's like 45 maybe.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.200]   And it's only 2G.
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.960]   You can do text messages, you can play Snake, and you can do phone calls.
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:22.480]   Why would you want that, Bobo?
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.920]   Okay, so I did...
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:26.240]   I actually like the last for eight days.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.000]   So I actually bought...
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.680]   I had to import it from Taiwan or something, but I got whatever...
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:36.720]   What was the model of the Nokia phone, the one that was like the banana phone,
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.240]   the one they used in the Matrix?
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:39.440]   You got the banana phone?
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:43.920]   Yeah, because they did the same thing, they made it a 2G version.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.280]   You can put in...
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:49.440]   I actually think you can put a 4G sim into it, but you can do SMS or whatever on it.
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.160]   It has Wi-Fi.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.200]   I bought it because my friend, Sue's, had it, and I had FOMO.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:57.760]   So I was like, "What did you get the yellow one?"
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:58.480]   Like the Matrix?
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.280]   I did, I got the yellow one.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.320]   You are so funny.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:02.560]   And it has the color screen.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:04.320]   It's kind of like the modern kind of update.
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:09.600]   And I mean, look, it's a fun throwback, and I actually got it so I could maybe do some IoT stuff,
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:14.320]   so I could maybe use it as kind of controller for some things.
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:21.840]   Because it's running this KaiOS thing, which is not Android, but it's kind of a Linux-based thing.
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.200]   Anyway, it's fine, but...
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:27.040]   I was reminded...
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.480]   No, I was reminded of T9, and I could never use that again.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:32.480]   I think my...
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.440]   T9, yeah.
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.400]   Yeah, you have to use T9 on it, which is ridiculous.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.680]   Oh, that's so ridiculous.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:41.440]   By the way, that's the Nokia 8110.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:43.360]   Yes, it's the 8110.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.080]   How I don't...
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:49.280]   And look, the one thing actually I have used it is that because it's unlocked,
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:52.480]   it's been a really good phone to use internationally if I want to just...
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:54.400]   If I don't want to...
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:58.240]   Because I pay for it for my international data, but if I want to have a different phone
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.640]   that I can use as a hotspot of sorts, that actually...
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.800]   It's been a really, really good international phone.
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.400]   Of course, I don't travel anymore, so that's less useful.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:13.280]   But the T9 thing, honestly, in 2020, logging into Twitter or Facebook or whatever,
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.560]   is such a nightmare.
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:15.520]   I never...
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:17.840]   No.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.120]   But I could bet, Christina, your thumbs remember it.
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.640]   Yeah, but...
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:23.680]   Did it come back to you?
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:24.240]   Did it come back to you?
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:26.480]   Yeah, no, but the process was going through the passwords and all that stuff.
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:26.960]   I know.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.480]   Yep, it's back, but it's just so slow.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:29.440]   I'm just like, no.
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:32.720]   I haven't done this in 15 years for a reason, right?
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:33.040]   Like...
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:36.960]   Mind you, you're being in junior high.
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:39.120]   Yes, I had a psychic too, yeah.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:44.640]   Yeah, I mean, I do remember when the Matrix came out and they brought that phone out after the film.
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:47.840]   And we had a delivery guy who would deliver...
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:53.840]   This is on PCMag, our main delivery guy who would deliver review samples in.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:58.400]   He's a biker, he always carried this kit on the back of his bike,
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:01.040]   came in and he was just like, "Oh, his phone went off."
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:05.200]   And I was like, "Chk, yeah, I had the coolest guy in the world."
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:08.720]   There is something...
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:10.000]   It's kind of cute, we get that throwback.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:18.320]   I bet you, in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, Chaz, there are a few hipsters carrying around,
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:20.880]   maybe in Nokia 35, 10, or...
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:22.560]   I mean, you would say...
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:24.000]   I don't think so.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:24.720]   No?
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:25.520]   Even there?
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:25.840]   No?
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.600]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.600]   I'll say the only use case for these is when you're...
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.040]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:36.400]   Yeah, I mean, the only use case for these is when you're either at a conference as a backup phone,
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:40.720]   because you can't find a PowerPoint, or if you're un-camping and you need a phone which lasts
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:42.080]   for a week without a recharge.
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:44.960]   Just for emergencies.
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:45.760]   I think so.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:51.600]   There are people in the Autonomous Zone, but they all came from Oregon with their Nokia phones.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.920]   Yeah, maybe the Oregon people see it.
[01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:57.680]   But yeah, because everybody who lives in the Chaz, or now they're trying to call it the Chaz,
[01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:00.080]   like everybody who lives here, we all work in tech.
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:05.840]   The Capitol Hill occupied occupational protest, which...
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:07.360]   Oh, where the moment is the biggest?
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:11.840]   That's the big good trying news now, because the Chaz kind of took things away from Black Lives
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:14.800]   Matter and was co-opted by hippies.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:20.560]   So now they're trying to get into rebrand it, which unfortunately, everyone's just going to call
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:20.960]   it Chaz.
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:24.960]   But we're talking about... And Christina lives two blocks from it, so that's why we're talking about.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.520]   We're talking about the area in Seattle that has been occupied by protesters.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:32.080]   The police have abandoned, and it's peaceful.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.480]   It's like a street fair. It's not a violent area.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.800]   It's just kind of a hangout.
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.480]   There's a big park.
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.600]   There's a grocery store.
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:43.760]   It's just people gathering.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:49.200]   Right next to the East Precinct, and which the police have abandoned.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.560]   But nobody said it on fire.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:51.520]   No.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.800]   It's peaceful.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:53.120]   Yeah.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:56.560]   Unlike Wendy's, which deserves to be set on fire.
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:58.160]   Frankly, sir.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:01.440]   Let's see.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.320]   Oh, look.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:04.320]   Is that O'Dr. in the chair room?
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.840]   Hey, O'Dr., good to see you.
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.840]   He's probably here to yell at me.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:08.880]   I didn't hear him screaming.
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:10.480]   He's going to yell at me.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.440]   [laughter]
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.160]   I know he is.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:13.760]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:14.480]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:16.080]   Let's talk about Apple.
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:21.040]   They have an event coming up one week from Monday, the worldwide developers' conference.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:25.200]   We will, of course, do our usual coverage of the stream.
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:26.000]   It's not this Monday.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:26.960]   It's a week from Monday.
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:30.720]   We'll come and we'll watch and we'll talk.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:32.800]   It's expected.
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:36.480]   We know they'll announce the new version of Mac OS X.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.880]   I have a feeling they've been naming it after California Landmarks.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.520]   It's going to be Mac OS S. Condido.
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:45.280]   That's just my thought.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:52.080]   They also will announce the new version of iPhone OS, which I think maybe Ant-Pruit will like
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:52.960]   iOS 14.
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:54.960]   The rumor is we'll have widgets.
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:59.520]   They'll, for the first time in a long time, change that static.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:01.840]   Well, welcome to Android 1.0, right?
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:02.480]   Exactly.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:03.360]   [laughter]
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:07.520]   I'm just going to say you can just piss off all the Android fanboys now.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:11.520]   Back to 2008, Android.
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.960]   There are rumors that they might announce a new Apple TV.
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:17.840]   I love the rumor that they're going to announce a new iMac.
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:18.880]   I can't afford it.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.000]   Shouldn't buy it.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.360]   Happy with my iMac.
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:24.480]   Fortunately, I'm getting a lot of pressure from John and others to buy it.
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:25.120]   Thank you, John.
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:26.160]   Keep that pressure up.
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:30.720]   It's a very narrow-- the rumor.
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:35.760]   Narrow bezel display based on the $5,000 Apple XDR display.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:39.840]   Although this one comes with a stand, which is, hey, that's a good deal.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:41.840]   Thanks for throwing that in, Apple.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.040]   [laughter]
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.680]   I mean, come on, let's find it.
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:46.160]   It's at the wheels.
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:50.480]   You're going to have Apple TV, which is about as popular as a rattlesnite
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.120]   nip in your house.
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:52.480]   I like my Apple TV.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.320]   It's too expensive, though.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:55.120]   Well, it's 200 bucks.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:03:01.200]   But I mean, also, I mean, come on, they're trying to sell us wheels for a computer for 500 bucks.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:02.400]   Most of people don't need them.
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.000]   Why include them if you don't need them?
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.040]   Why charge $500, though?
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.160]   Well, they're special wheels.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:08.400]   Yes.
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:09.760]   Oh, yeah, right.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:10.800]   There's nothing in the wheels.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:11.360]   No, we don't need them.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:11.840]   Come on.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:15.360]   I mean, it's just a very highly engineered look.
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.720]   Especially.
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.240]   It's goodness.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:18.720]   Sike.
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:19.360]   I wonder.
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:23.520]   I seriously wonder whether the accounts in Sarappolo go, come on, seriously.
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:25.520]   How much do you think we can get for this?
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:25.840]   Yeah.
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:26.240]   They are.
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:27.120]   They are.
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:27.600]   They are.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.160]   They are.
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:28.640]   They are.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:28.640]   They are.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:28.640]   They are.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:28.640]   They are.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:28.640]   They are.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:28.640]   They are.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:28.640]   They are.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:28.640]   They are.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:29.440]   I wonder.
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:29.840]   I wonder.
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.120]   They taste like a tr -
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:31.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:32.160]   They just like -
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:33.040]   It's a little appily.
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:33.520]   Yeah.
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:39.360]   The display is $5,000, or if you want nanotexture glass $6,000,
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:43.920]   but it doesn't include a stand, which is an additional $1,000.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:44.480]   $1,000.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:49.600]   I wonder how many people, though, just lean their display on some books and leave it at that.
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:57.200]   I feel like - maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like, you know, because none of us are in the market for
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:57.440]   this.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.720]   I mean, Leo, you might be like some people in your production might actually be in the market.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:05.920]   No, nobody. Nobody. No, nobody. Literally. Right. So, so what I'm saying is like, I -
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:08.480]   Marques Brownlee is the only person in the market for this.
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:12.720]   Well, I was saying like, Hollywood production studios, like, big, big places.
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:16.240]   These are literally the only people who are buying this other than YouTubers who are
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:18.720]   trying to get that that sweet sweet content money.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.840]   So if you're not trying to get, you know, the sweet click juice, like, it's not for us,
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.920]   which I think as a Mac person, this is disappointing.
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.200]   But also when I put it in that perspective, I'm like, all right, charge whatever you want,
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.000]   because I'm not going to ever be able to have this anyway.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.680]   Like, this is not for me.
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:34.240]   Yeah, it's not for me.
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:34.720]   Really.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:37.680]   So anyway, those are - that's - they'll probably be some hardware.
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:42.160]   The big announcement though, and the one I think that's worth spending some time with,
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:46.400]   we did on Mac Break Weekly for sure on Tuesday, is the rumor and this comes from Mark Gurman,
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:50.640]   well sourced at Bloomberg, that Apple will at this point announce the transition
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:55.920]   away from Intel toward their own custom design chips based on the ARM architecture.
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:57.280]   That is a big deal.
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:59.120]   Not the first time Apple's done this.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:02.320]   It's actually the third time Apple changed their chipset.
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:07.920]   They were originally Motorola 68000 based, then they went to PowerPC, then they went to Intel.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:10.960]   And all of those transitions took time.
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:14.000]   I think they were well managed considering what a big change that is.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.200]   I wonder how long this will take the ARM transition and what it will mean.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:22.880]   It's not really - I mean, it makes sense you could do ARM pretty quickly.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.920]   Honestly, the iPad Pro is probably more horsepower than a MacBook Air,
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:31.280]   so you could do ARM on a low end, something like a MacBook Air.
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:34.240]   It's really a question of, can you make an ARM computer that's going to make an app
[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:39.920]   Pruitt happy that my editors would want to use for professional users?
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:45.840]   My question was, you mentioned some of the alleged highlights that they were going to talk about.
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.600]   Did you mention iPad OS?
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:53.840]   Well, I didn't because I mentioned iOS 14 and I forget that they make a
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:57.600]   distinction between iOS for a phone and iPad.
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:58.480]   I don't know.
[02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:00.720]   Is there something new for iPad OS that you know about?
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:05.520]   I hope it is because I still can't quite get used to iPad OS.
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:06.960]   Oh, you know what?
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:13.200]   Did you - I got to get you the - oh, you need first of all the iPad Pro, but the magic keyboard.
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:14.560]   Transformational.
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:17.440]   It's a mere $350.
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.720]   Hey, I don't have an iPad Pro.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:27.120]   It's less than three wheels, but four wheels.
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:32.960]   But for the first time ever, I am actually doing real work, real writing,
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:39.200]   real editing, real posting on my iPad because the trackpad and the keyboard,
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:42.080]   which is a good keyboard, much better than the smart keyboard,
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:44.160]   really do turn it into a decent computer.
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:47.120]   There's software missing, but it's coming.
[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:50.240]   I think the software is getting better and better.
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:55.280]   Well, see, for me, the software is already there for me on iPad.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:56.480]   Like I said, I don't have the Pro.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:57.840]   I should have gotten the Pro anymore.
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:06:58.880]   I think about it.
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:02.000]   I just have the latest non-Pro GM or whatever.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:02.320]   Yeah.
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:07.040]   And it's nice, but the file system just really -
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:08.400]   Well, they don't expose me.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:09.600]   Yeah, you use an - I go it.
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:13.200]   I use Affinity for - Affinity for photo editing.
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:17.120]   And I also use Photoshop on iPad, which has just been recently updated.
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:19.840]   I did not have the curves tool and Gaussian filter.
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:21.440]   And beautiful.
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:28.720]   But it's just such a pain in the - took us to get my files from the cloud and onto the device
[02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:31.920]   where I can find them pretty easily where Android just -
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:35.520]   if I download something from the web on an Android device,
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:38.960]   I go to the downloads folder and boom, there it is.
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:39.360]   You know, it's just -
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.200]   They don't expose the file system.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:43.520]   It's there, but they don't let you get to it.
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:44.000]   Right.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:50.320]   It is a little bit of a - I think it's a - you just have to shift your context because
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.960]   you're used to a real computer with a real file system.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:57.520]   But honestly - But that's what I thought iPadOS was supposed to do,
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:59.760]   was to bring you that new file system.
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:02.400]   I thought they said that they had a press - Well, they have files - a press call for years ago.
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:02.880]   Program.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:06.720]   I mean, they make more of it available, right?
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:09.760]   Like you can - you have APIs now, and it's better than it used to be.
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:11.360]   But yeah, I mean, it's not the same.
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:15.120]   And I think Tileo's point - and I struggle with this myself, right?
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:17.840]   Is that you almost have to go into it with a completely different mindset of saying,
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.640]   "Okay, I'm going to use this device in a different way."
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:24.640]   I can't just use it the same way that I used my - and it's - you know, their computer.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:25.440]   It's not a bad way.
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:26.320]   It's not a bad way.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:28.160]   But those - it's very different.
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:28.320]   It's different.
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:28.400]   It's different.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.760]   Like the surface works, right?
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:31.440]   It's different than the Macintosh, frankly.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:31.920]   Right.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.160]   But it's - it actually makes more sense,
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.160]   especially from a security point of view,
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:40.720]   that documents are owned by programs and visible only to those programs.
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:42.800]   And if you want a document to go from one program to another,
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:43.760]   you have to share it.
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:46.400]   It's different from what we're used to,
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:50.880]   but I think it actually is probably a good idea from a security point of view.
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:52.960]   But I mean, this was Apple's problem.
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:57.360]   I mean, I - I got rid of Apple's from my life in the early '90s,
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:01.040]   because you couldn't muck about with the operating system.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:04.880]   You had to use ResEdit, which was kind of like trying to repair a nuclear act.
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:06.160]   Yes, but it had it.
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:07.120]   Yes, but it had it.
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:07.840]   That's the point.
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:10.320]   Yeah, but DOS, you could do that automatically.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:11.040]   Yeah.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:11.600]   With DOS.
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:16.080]   You can't compare DOS to Mac or System 7.
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:16.880]   That's crazy.
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.600]   I could do a lot more with DOS than I could do with the Apple operating system at the time.
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:26.800]   And even with Windows - okay, not Windows 10, because that's a pile of whatever.
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:29.920]   But I mean, with older versions of Windows,
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.480]   you could still get into the guts of your system and change what you wanted to change.
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:36.080]   I'll give you a wild example.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:38.480]   Apple has always been like - This changed.
[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:39.120]   This is changed.
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:39.680]   This is a way it goes.
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:41.840]   I'll give you a wild example.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:42.960]   So I have a blog.
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:44.960]   It's actually hosted on this computer over here,
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:46.400]   which is running Debian Linux.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:51.760]   It's using a static blog generator called Hugo, written in Go.
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.720]   Hugo runs on the server.
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:10:02.160]   But I am able to modify my blog just by SSHing into that server,
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:05.200]   and either modifying the files directly there,
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:13.200]   or - and I've lately started to do this using a Markdown editor on Mac, Windows, or iOS,
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:18.000]   modifying the file and having - and saving it to this server,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.440]   and then it automatically builds the site.
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:22.080]   It's really a great streamline workflow.
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.000]   Believe it or not, it's the kind of thing you'd expect Linux to be perfect.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.320]   You know, you can mount an SSH file system, and I use eMacs and all that stuff,
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.600]   and I was doing that.
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:36.640]   And then I'm using Panix code editor from Panix software on iOS.
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:38.240]   It's the best workflow I've ever had.
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:38.960]   It's amazing.
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:43.360]   It works beautifully on the iPad with the Magic Keyboard, the trackpad,
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:49.680]   and it's the kind of high-end geeky, direct file manipulation,
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:53.760]   logging into a server using SSH thing that you would not expect on an iPad.
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:57.360]   It actually works better on an iPad than it does on my Linux - on my Dell XPS running
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:59.520]   in general Linux.
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:00.800]   So I think we're getting there.
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:04.640]   I think some of it is contextually you just have to change your mindset.
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:10.000]   And I've been able to work around it, but it was when I hear,
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.360]   "Hey, we're putting a file system on iPad," I think.
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:14.000]   Right.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.920]   You think it's going to be the traditional thing.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:17.440]   And I think that's been the big difference, right?
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:19.200]   It's like if you look at the Surface devices,
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:20.880]   like you look at the Surface Go or other things,
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:23.360]   and you look at how touch is integrated into Windows 10,
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.000]   which, look, I never thought I would be this person,
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.040]   but I actually like Windows 10, especially with the Windows
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:32.400]   Surface and for Linux 2 stuff and some of that stuff.
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:39.120]   But the way that that treats touch is very much as an add-on to the existing paradigm.
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:40.960]   And Apple, it's the inverse, right?
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.480]   Is that they've graphed on the mouse and keyboard stuff.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:46.880]   And the ground up paradigm is touch.
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:49.840]   And so they tab two different approaches,
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:51.360]   and both of them have their trade-offs.
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:55.120]   And I think the big trade-off is if you go into it expecting it to work
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:01.520]   a traditional way in the case of iPad OS, or if you go to a Surface device expecting it to
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:02.800]   work like an iPad.
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:11.200]   So we haven't reached that like nirvana place of that kind of best of both.
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:18.000]   And we might not until maybe somebody else can tell us how to pair it on.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.400]   The proof is if you give somebody who's not used a computer before an iPad,
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:24.400]   they don't have any of these problems.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:24.880]   Right.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:25.520]   They just use it.
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:26.480]   They win every time.
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:26.960]   It's easy.
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:28.480]   Yep, I agree.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:31.680]   So a lot of this is our preconceived notion of what a computer is.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:33.120]   That's what Apple keeps saying, right?
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.720]   What's the key to that?
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:36.160]   And my preconceived notion is right, damn it.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:39.360]   I'll grant you that.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.440]   But no, I mean, seriously, one of the things that really irritates me about Apple at the moment
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:46.240]   is that they will not bring touch to their laptops.
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:50.960]   Because once you have touch on a laptop, it changes things completely.
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:55.760]   I was a skeptic about this, but then I started using Chromebooks and then
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:57.520]   Windows machines with touch laptops.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.840]   So with touch screens and it may rather than just click, click, click,
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:08.240]   you must go, you know, Apple refuses to do that for their laptop line.
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:09.680]   And I understand why they're doing it.
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:12.160]   I just think it's a really lousy decision.
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:16.080]   What was your use case for a touch on a laptop?
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:16.640]   Yeah.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:17.120]   Yeah.
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:17.200]   Yeah.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:17.760]   When do you use it?
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.560]   Because I never use it.
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:20.160]   I have two touch screen laptops.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:20.960]   I've never used it.
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.240]   OK.
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:22.960]   OK.
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:26.320]   I get like about 150 emails every morning.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:31.840]   So I can just put the email screen up and just go, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap,
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:34.080]   rather than getting them with the mouse out and doing it.
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:39.040]   I can drink by cup of tea and do the email clearance.
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:40.240]   You know, routine and the same.
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:42.800]   It saves me a hand.
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:48.320]   And also for things like widening and closing, it's just simpler.
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.840]   It saves you a couple of clicks.
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:55.120]   I'd like to touch interface on some of those laptops that we've reviewed
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:58.320]   for the network when it comes to doing the pension zoom.
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:00.960]   If I'm doing something in Photoshop or whatever,
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:04.400]   and be able to really immerse myself into those pixels.
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:10.160]   But outside of that, I never really found much of a use for touch interface on Windows.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:13.920]   But I was always curious to see why people desired it.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.480]   This is what Christine was talking about is exactly what happened,
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:19.680]   which is that Microsoft was doing desktop operating systems,
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:25.600]   saw the popularity of the iPad, said, let's go on, touch, and tablet onto a desktop OS.
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:26.800]   That did not work so well.
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.800]   It's working better in 10 than it did in 8.
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:31.840]   But it was a weird Apple.
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:37.680]   Apple decided, Apple said, no, we're going to keep macOS non-touch.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.040]   We're not going to do that.
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:42.560]   We already, the problem is Microsoft had given up on their touch OS.
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:44.640]   They had lost the phone war.
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:46.400]   So they didn't have a mobile OS.
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:48.720]   But Apple has a very credible mobile OS.
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:54.480]   And I think part of this ARM transition is we've got this interesting triumvirate here.
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:56.480]   We've got Intel-based Macs.
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:58.640]   We've got ARM-based iOS.
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:00.480]   We've got touch on the ARM.
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:03.120]   We've got no touch on the Intel.
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.720]   I think we're going to see kind of emerge at some point with the ARM systems.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:10.960]   I think what Apple's done, I wanted a Mac with touch.
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.240]   I really did for a long time.
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:16.800]   And now I'm fine because what they did was exactly the perfect thing to do,
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:21.520]   which is the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard with a trackpad.
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:27.920]   I watched myself working keyboard, touchpad, and touch, a trackpad and touch,
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:29.040]   all at the same time.
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:35.760]   And it flows beautifully and easily in a way that it never worked for me
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:38.560]   on desktop operating system.
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:43.040]   They're just in that sometimes you scroll with your finger, sometimes you use a trackpad.
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:45.920]   It all just works and it works so intuitively.
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:46.880]   It's out of the way.
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:50.640]   And so I'm starting to be a believer that Apple did the right thing.
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:56.720]   And that's why I'm very intrigued by this ARM transition because Apple has an advantage on iOS.
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:59.120]   They don't, first of all, they don't have to wait for Intel,
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.520]   which has been a real pain in the butt desktop.
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:02.480]   True.
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:04.560]   They don't have to pay Intel.
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:07.120]   But more importantly than any of that stuff,
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:10.640]   they can design a chip that's tailored for its use.
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:15.600]   Intel sells a general-purpose chip that's used everywhere from SpaceX,
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:21.040]   Dragon, Crew, Crew Dragon to a tablet.
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:25.040]   But Apple could say, "No, this ARM chip is going in a MacBook.
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:26.880]   This ARM chip's going in a MacBook Pro.
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:28.960]   This ARM chip's going in a Mac Pro."
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:34.800]   And tailor it to be more power per watt, less important on a desktop,
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:38.160]   still low heat, more efficiencies, not a bad thing.
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:43.840]   I think that they can actually make their software sing by making the hardware.
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:45.360]   That's always been their point of view.
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:50.240]   Yeah, I was going to say, wasn't that the culture from the get-go-use ago in Apple?
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:51.600]   Yeah.
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:55.360]   It might only concern, and it'll be interesting to see how they handle it.
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:59.760]   I mean, my concern isn't so much how our existing apps going to port over,
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:05.680]   because I'm sure that there will be some outlier edge cases where they won't be able to just
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.400]   use Xcode and compile to an ARM target rather than X86.
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:14.800]   And it's possible that they might be able to bring in similar to what the data with Rosetta
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.600]   when they went from PowerPC to Intel, some sort of translation layer.
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:23.120]   All of that's complicated because doing X64 on ARM is not really a thing,
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.920]   and X86 in general on ARM suffers.
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:31.120]   But I think my bigger thing is I can see how a lot of the applications will be able to move over.
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:34.800]   But I worry that A, this might be a sign that says,
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:38.800]   if it's not in the Mac App Store, you can't run it because that would limit things.
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:42.320]   But B, I do have to feel like, and I realize I'm a complete edge case here.
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:48.560]   I realize that me saying this is the smallest part of their user base,
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:51.840]   but I do worry about losing things that, to me, make a Mac a Mac,
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:55.840]   and those are things like virtualization and things like being able to
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:03.760]   have my own programs that are outside the Mac App Store and being able to run Windows if I
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:10.960]   want to, or Linux or something else. And I could see this being an excuse for them to just drop
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:15.360]   those things and make it just focused on just things in the Mac App Store and other stuff.
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:19.280]   And I have to say, as somebody who deeply loves the Mac and loves
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:25.120]   a lot of the freedom, which I know is kind of an ironic me to say, but I feel like I have a lot
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:32.160]   of freedom with my Mac. I do worry about losing that. It does. Freedom with a slightly bound
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:38.640]   company. No, no, because you have BSD under the hood, you've got a terminal. You could do anything
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:45.360]   you want with a Mac. But if you switch to iOS, you can't get other apps that Apple doesn't approve
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:49.920]   of. And I worry that that's not the case on the Mac. Right. That's not the case on the Mac. I'm
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:53.680]   talking about the Mac. I can actually install any operating system. And I can actually, I actually
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:57.920]   have no idea. And that's why they're trying to. Sorry. I shouldn't interrupt.
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:02.480]   No, I was just saying, like, I look, I get the irony in me saying that I'm just saying, like,
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:06.480]   for me, I actually feel like I have a lot of freedom in my Mac right now. And obviously,
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:10.560]   Apple's made some changes around notarization and some other things to kind of tap that down.
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:15.600]   But at the end of the day, it hasn't been iOS, right? Like it has been this different platform.
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:20.400]   And my concern isn't so much that arm would take that away because there's nothing about the
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:27.600]   chipset that would do that. It's that that would be kind of the opportunity to get rid of some of
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:33.120]   these things that at least for me are what makes an acama. I have always worried about it.
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:38.000]   And I was when the store came, I said, Oh, God, it's just a matter of time before Apple says,
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.000]   you can only just like iOS, you only get things from the store. I think Apple understands that's
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:48.080]   a non starter. And I think what Apple's done is they very cleverly balanced security and gatekeeper
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:54.320]   and a store give you security. So far, and I agree with you, Christina, it would be a nightmare
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:58.960]   if they didn't, but so far, they've always allowed you an escape hatch. Even with notarization,
[02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:04.480]   I can go in and I might have to use a command line ultimately to do it and modify gatekeeper
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:09.120]   to allow me to do whatever I want. And I think that that's Apple's plan. I think they're going to
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:14.640]   always leave it that way, even with an arm Mac, because they know that people buy desktop computers
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:21.520]   want full control, but they are also going to do it in such a way that people who buy desk
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:26.400]   computers who don't want full control and don't want to worry about security have a very secure
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:31.760]   system. And I think Apple's done a really interesting job. I would say the Macintosh with gatekeeper
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:39.760]   and a lot of other lesser known technologies is made is a very stable, secure operating system,
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:44.320]   especially when you compare it to Windows. You see, I worry with Apple that the accountants are
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:49.040]   going to take over and they're going to say it'd be much more profitable if we got everyone into
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:54.560]   this wall garden thing. But that's not what computing is about. And I think a number of Apple,
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:59.360]   I think Apple is playing quite a clever game here. Mac OS, yeah, when you want to play around
[02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:04.640]   with the machine system, when you know your stuff, everyone else stick to iOS, give it a
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:09.840]   good money. Yep. And I don't see any reason for them to change that. They need developers.
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:16.080]   They need pro users. They need people who want power control. They're not going to turn their,
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:19.680]   I would hope even the accountants wouldn't make them turn their back on those people.
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:26.800]   It is interesting though to kind of see like the weird timing where we're presumably going to be
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:32.640]   getting ARM based Macs, but Apple is also selling $10,000 Intel Macs.
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:36.320]   Yeah, they just started. Right. And they don't want to obsolete that right away.
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:41.040]   Well, that is the interesting question, right? Because it's like, okay, when the last transition
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:44.320]   happened, they were able to do it in under a year and it started in January and they were
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:50.800]   basically done by the end of the year when they kind of finished doing things. And it was a huge
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:55.920]   success and actually brought a ton of people, including myself, I became a full-time Mac user
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:22:00.880]   when the Intel transition happened. But you kind of wonder with this, it's like, okay,
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:05.760]   you obviously still want to sell and you need to support this high-end audience that is spending
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:12.000]   $10,000 on a machine. How do you reconcile that with also being like, oh, but we're going to have
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:16.560]   these ARM based machines? And I have no idea how they're going to do it, but that'll be interesting
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:21.680]   to see, I guess, how they delineate and how they differentiate the different platforms and
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:28.160]   that. It's going to be interesting to see how, because I mean, when Microsoft tried the ARM
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:33.120]   based machine thing, it died on its backside. But they were buying almost off the shelf chips
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:37.280]   from Qualcomm. They weren't making their own chips. Yeah, exactly. Apple seems to be smarter about
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:44.640]   this. It's going to be really interesting to see how this turns out. Apple has 1,000 chip
[02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:52.560]   designers. They bought P.A. risk. P.A. Semi, which made the P.A. risk processors. They have
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:57.600]   all the expertise and they have had for some time, all the expertise to make a chip that's
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:02.480]   every bit as powerful as a Xeon. I don't think just because it's a risk processor,
[02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:10.640]   ARM based architectures are somehow lesser. I don't think they can make it.
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:16.160]   No, I mean, one of the things that makes Apple really good at security is they build their own
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:21.440]   chips and they build their own security in the hardware level. And I will criticize Apple until
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:26.640]   the cows come home. But when it comes to security, they're damn good at it because they baked that
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:33.520]   thing in right at the core. And more power to do. I'm this is exciting to me, this ARM transition.
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:38.320]   It's a good question, Christine. Is it going to be the one year power PC to Intel transition?
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:43.440]   Or is it going to take a little longer? I think the bet is it's going to take a few years.
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:48.320]   I mean, I think that would make some sense. And I think in some ways too, maybe that's when
[02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:54.000]   you say like, OK, if you want a really good battery life machine that's going to be lower weight,
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:59.680]   then have really good battery life. But it's not an iPad, then we have this. It will be interesting
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:03.360]   though to see like, how do you differentiate and how? Because I frankly think they do have a really
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:06.640]   hard time right now. I don't think they're doing a great job telling people why should you use an
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:11.280]   iPad Pro and why should you buy MacBook Air? Think that they cost about the same once you add in
[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:17.920]   the keyboard. And I don't think that that story is really frankly well told. And so I think this
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:23.440]   adds complexity to that too, right? Which is like, OK, why do I get an iPad Pro with a magic keyboard
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:31.040]   or an ARM based MacBook? That becomes an interesting question. But I'm looking forward to seeing what
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:36.720]   happens and I'm positive that I'll more than likely be buying one of their devices. I mean,
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:40.560]   that's-- I won't be buying a Mac Pro. I could tell you that right now. No, I won't be getting a Mac
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:45.360]   Pro, but I'm saying that I could almost certainly be seeing that it's like getting an ARM based Mac
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:51.200]   if it's only for, you know, because I look at it. As I'm saying, when I added that magic keyboard
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:57.760]   to my iPad Pro, it got pretty close to the kind of power that I want in any computer.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:02.560]   It got pretty darn close. It's different. That's the-- you're exactly right. It's different.
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:09.840]   And you have to re-jigger your mindset. But considering the financial talk we had about them
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.800]   earlier in the show, if you were to look into your crystal ball because I know you're such a
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:21.920]   maven about the stock market, what happens after this announcement, a legit announcement that,
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:29.600]   hey, we're doing our own chips. Stock market is so complicated right now because it's-- I don't--
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:33.680]   actually, we only have-- we're already an hour and a half. I don't know if I want to start this.
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:38.800]   But it's-- I've actually been thinking a lot about this. And Jim Kramer has said some interesting
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:44.640]   things. You have to understand, there's people with money. There's a very big question mark
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:48.480]   about the US economy going forward. We're in a recession. We are.
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:52.800]   But there's no-- but people have this money. They've got to put it somewhere. They're not
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:26:00.080]   putting their couch. So it's a very interesting time right now. And that's-- I mean, you're also
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:08.960]   seeing like-- we just saw a record high for the NASDAQ. What? Sorry. The US government is
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:14.000]   guaranteeing stock exchange returns. Stock exchange-- That's exactly right. And they put
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.800]   trillions of dollars. That's exactly-- And that's one of the unknowns.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:21.360]   It's like about student debt or anything like that. No, trillions of dollars. No, that's exactly right.
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:28.560]   That's one of the unknowns because come July 31st, when the $600 unemployment check stops--
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:34.880]   So it's a way. And when-- and then, of course, late in October, you're going to have those mortgages
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:40.800]   that people have been able to defer come to. And also the second wave of infections coming in.
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:48.880]   And also people who got the PPE loans will be able to let people go without putting their loan at risk.
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:56.400]   Right. That's right. So I suspect a crash in the fall. My personal decision was to sell all my stocks.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:04.240]   I don't have any-- I got out of the market in like March because I did not want to ride this
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:08.720]   roller coaster. And there are a lot of people saying, "Yeah, but Leo, you're going to miss out
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:13.600]   when the thing takes off." Yeah, but I also might miss out when the thing hits bottom.
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:19.440]   I just don't want to play this game, but I'm also old. I don't have time to recoup any losses.
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:25.520]   This is my retirement money. So I'm in a different position too. If I tell my kids,
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:29.600]   "Stay in it. Ride it." You got lots of time. You got 30 years before you're going to need that
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:36.080]   money, 40 years. No, you buy stocks and you keep them at the same time. I mean, this is when you've
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:41.520]   got headlines like Dow reaches New Heights, unemployment reaches 40 million.
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:47.520]   It's bizarre. There's a serious disconnect. This is late stage capitalism gone mad.
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:51.120]   And let's not forget the part of the reason-- and you just-- I think you just mentioned this.
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:54.720]   No, you didn't. Actually, somebody else in the chat room mentioned it. The shill.
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:59.840]   One of the reasons Apple stock is that Apple's market cap is worth 100 and a half trillions,
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:04.080]   because they have been spending all of the money they're getting on stock buybacks.
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:10.720]   They're artificially inflating it. They're inflating it. So it may-- it has-- this is the problem I
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:15.360]   have with the stock market. It doesn't have anything to do with fundamentals. I mean, we forget that
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:23.920]   it's companies buying their own stock was illegal until 1983. I think it was. But Intel has spent
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:30.560]   $125 billion buying its own stock, yet it still can't produce 10 nanometers.
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:36.800]   Rowing the seriously. Get your priorities straight. That's why I'm not the stock market right now.
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:45.520]   As I get as a CEO, that your salary is put on the-- is based on the salary price, the share price
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:53.040]   of the company. But just invest in basic technology. You can't waste 100 billion. What he can't produce
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:59.760]   chips. This is your job. It is a mystery. Let's take one more break. And then we do have to
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:04.640]   wrap it up. There's still so much to talk about. I wanted to talk about Zoom. Maybe we'll end
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:12.640]   then. And with Zoom. Because Zoom has had another no good very bad week. Our show today brought
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:17.680]   to you by Worldwide Technology. I love these guys. This was the last time I traveled. It was
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:23.200]   back in March. We went out to St. Louis to see their advanced technology center. I was blown away.
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:28.160]   This is something that started in a corner of one building 10 years ago and has grown. It's in
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:34.720]   three or four buildings now. Half a billion dollars worth of equipment from hundreds of OEMs.
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:42.320]   Keep partners ranging from heavyweights like Dell EMC. I saw a lot of storage from Dell in that rack.
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:49.360]   And those racks from VMware, from Intel. But also emerging disruptors like Equinix. It's an amazing
[02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:57.440]   confluence of all these technologies. And there's a reason it's there. Because WWT is a trusted
[02:29:57.440 --> 02:30:02.720]   partner for big businesses, for little businesses all over the world. And if you're going to buy
[02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:07.520]   Dell EMC storage, you want to try it. You want to integrate into your system. And that's what they
[02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:12.320]   do at the Advanced Technology Center. They've been using it for their engineers to spin a
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:18.000]   proof of concept, to do pilots, to show customers what the best solutions are, how this is going
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:23.200]   to work with that. But now you can use it too, which is even more mind-boggling. This is why
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:29.600]   WWT is I think it's actually a secret weapon for the businesses who partner with them.
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:35.280]   It's been kind of my mission to get this better known. I had known nothing about it when I went
[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:41.040]   out there. I was blown away. And now I understand why customers have been with them for more than a
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:45.840]   decade. Because they know they've got a partner here at WWT that's got the knowledge of places they
[02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:52.400]   can go to get the answers they need. These labs are amazing. On-demand, scheduleable labs, you don't
[02:30:52.400 --> 02:31:00.080]   have to be in St. Louis 24/7 anywhere in the world like Dell EMC VX Rail, Data Protection Center and IDPA.
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:07.840]   I mean, the latest in primary storage, but there's hundreds of labs to explore everything from
[02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:13.120]   multi-cloud to hyper-converged infrastructure to networking to secondary storage, data analytics,
[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:19.280]   AI security, it goes on and on. And you get to trial. It's the best playground ever.
[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:26.160]   It's so awesome. You can learn about products before you launch them, reducing the concept
[02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:31.920]   time for months to weeks, your speed to market. And yeah, I know, you know, we're going through a
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:37.200]   weird time, but it still makes a difference to have the best technology. And now may be a good time
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:43.040]   to start looking at your infrastructure, start going to WWT and saying, "How can we make this better?"
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:48.080]   This lab is a service started last summer. Perfect timing, right? Customers can do their own
[02:31:48.080 --> 02:31:52.880]   programmatic testing. They've got one of the cages in there with so-called, I said, "Why is that
[02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:57.120]   cage separate from all the others?" It's got all that gear in there. But it's all locked up. But they
[02:31:57.120 --> 02:32:02.400]   said, "That's the malware cage. That's where we put all the malware. So it has to be air-gapped
[02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:08.400]   from the rest of the ATC. But if we need to know how ransomware works, if we need to do research on
[02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:13.040]   that, we got it all in that cage over there. It's really cool. I talked to a lot of the engineers,
[02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:18.160]   many of them, listen to the show. They all love their job because they get to play with the latest
[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:22.640]   technology. And you do too now. If you want to know more, if you want to take advantage of
[02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:29.040]   this digital platform encompassing the entire advanced technology ecosystem, get articles, case
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:33.040]   studies, hands-on labs, all the tools you need to make a difference in today's fast-paced world,
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:40.560]   go to www.t.com/twit. It's a multiplier effective knowledge and speed and agility anytime, anywhere
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:45.920]   in the world for partner and customers. I have just scratched the surface of the things they do.
[02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:53.200]   Unbelievable stuff. They are there for you. If you needed an enterprise, they've got a
[02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:57.840]   www.wwt.com/twit. www.wt.com/twit.
[02:32:57.840 --> 02:33:02.480]   W-w-t simplifies the complex worldwide technology delivering business and technology outcomes around
[02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:10.160]   the world and modernizing IT infrastructure for everybody in the right way, the rational way.
[02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:14.480]   Thank you, www.wt.com/twit. I guess we'll do this quickly.
[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:20.480]   Unless we want to do the first five-hour twit. I think we should. But nobody minds, right? You
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:26.000]   guys have a fun, right? Anybody's fainting from online? My bad. Sometimes I know I can ramble along
[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:32.400]   with my slow slow pace cadence. Your fault. I'll take the full blame. You're great. You're very,
[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:38.080]   you know what I love about Ant? You're soothing. You make me feel better about life. I love having
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:34:00.880]   you. I know. I'm trying this off because she's cameras.
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:14.160]   Wow. I'm a switch camera. I'm a switch camera. I remember when Zoom a year ago got a lot of heat
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:19.440]   because basically they were installing malware on Mac and Tasha's. I don't think they did it out
[02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:25.120]   of any malicious intent. They wanted to make it really easy to start a Zoom teleconference.
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:30.640]   What they did when you installed Zoom on your Mac, they installed a web server. Hey, what could
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.840]   possibly go wrong? They installed a web server on your Mac and that was so you could click a link,
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:41.280]   would download the software, it would run the conference. You know, when you uninstalled Zoom,
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:46.480]   it left the web server running again so that should you ever want to do another Zoom conference?
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:52.720]   It just clicked. It's amazing. I thought I had installed that. It's still there. It became a problem
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:59.680]   when hackers started to use it as a gateway in the Macs. Apple, Zoom did nothing. Apple eventually,
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:03.760]   nothing. They ignored it. They said, yeah, fine. It's intentional. That's a sign.
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:08.960]   When the security researcher reported to them, they were like, no, this is intentional. This is
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:15.280]   what we want. Yeah, we wanted to do that. Apple actually had to do ship a patch to the operating
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:20.560]   system to get rid of it eventually Zoom capitulated. But that was a black mark for the company and
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:29.120]   made me suspect them as maybe not the best people. There were other issues. Along comes COVID
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:36.240]   everybody's conferencing. Suddenly Zoom goes from 10 million active users in a month in December
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:43.600]   to 400 million. I think it's almost 600 million now. It's huge. The stock price goes through the roof.
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:48.320]   They've got tons of money. They hear people. They say, oh, you're worried about our security.
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:52.320]   We're sending data through China. That's not good. Okay, we're going to hire the best in the
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:57.120]   business. They went out. They hired Alex Stamos. They went out. They got Katie Missouri's company.
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:02.720]   They went out and they bought key base. And they got the best cryptographers.
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:07.840]   And they brought them in all in. But and Steve Gibson was impressed. These guys wrote a white
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:11.920]   paper. Steve said, this is our security guy security now. This is great. This is exactly the
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:22.080]   right thing. This is the way to do it. But then they made some funny noises. Last week, the CEO
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:27.440]   Eric, he won of Zoom said, we're going to have an end encryption. They were always claiming an
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:34.160]   end encryption, even though it wasn't. It was decrypted at the servers. We're going to have an
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:39.120]   end encryption, but we won't have it for free users. We want the literally said, we want law
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:45.440]   enforcement to be able to get into those conferences. Okay. But then they also said,
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:50.560]   and this was the thing Steve got upset on Tuesday. He was reading this. He said, they also said,
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:56.800]   two conflicting things. They said, we'll have encryption for paid users. And then they said,
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:02.560]   but we'll have the keys, which means the whole thing about law enforcement can access the free
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:09.120]   accounts. Law enforcement can access all the accounts. They don't have end to end encryption,
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:13.840]   and they don't intend to put it in. They got they paid for these wonderful people to write this
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:18.480]   white paper, and they're not going to do it. It's my. Well, I'm proud we call it talking out the
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:25.760]   side of your neck. Yeah. Yeah. That reminds me what Blackberry did for for many, many years,
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:29.840]   is the Blackberry would always talk about how great their encryption was on their devices and
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.320]   really, yeah, on their bez and whatnot, their biz. And really, they would just hand the keys
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:38.400]   over to law enforcement. They gave it to China. They gave it to Russia. Anybody who asked,
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:43.280]   oh, yeah, you want the server keys? No problem. Here you go. So I and then now the latest thing is
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:51.440]   on the anniversary of the 10 of N massacre, an American Chinese activist in America had a Zoom
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:56.160]   conference talking about it. Some people in China joined the conference. Chinese government
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:03.840]   went to zoom said, ban that guy, and they shut down an American zoom account. Son of a mother.
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:07.680]   No, they've shut down a lot of American zoom accounts.
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:13.840]   And it's quite frankly shameful. I mean, they're just like, yeah, we'll do end to end encryption
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:18.720]   except we won't and we'll charge you for it. I mean, this is an
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:24.560]   minute president. She comes to us and says, shut it down. We don't now, I understand. Look,
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:31.120]   Apple does that in China. Apple just took two apps out of the app store. Microsoft and Yahoo
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:34.960]   as well. Yeah. But that's because they're in China and they're doing business in China. They
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:38.560]   have to follow the laws of the country they're in. So you could make some case for that.
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:44.640]   But that's different from shutting down American activists in America because China asked you to.
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:50.560]   Now, Zoom is an American company, but all the coding is done in China
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:55.600]   by three separate Chinese companies. I still think Zoom has tight ties to the Chinese regime.
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:59.440]   And I honestly do not after this do not trust Zoom.
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:07.760]   No, I honestly, I avoid it wherever possible. I do find it particularly
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:11.600]   galling when they're just like, OK, well, we will provide end to end into
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:18.160]   encryption. And then they just don't. I mean, as you pointed out, they will hand this over to
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:23.920]   whichever government asks for it. So yeah, don't trust it. It's not in the end. If they have the keys,
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:30.480]   that ain't in the end. I mean, when they first started, I mean, OK, when COVID really kicked in
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:34.400]   and it was kind of like, well, it's a small startup. They can't be expected to
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:39.920]   move. They gave all the security. Yeah, you give them pass on that. But then when they get in,
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:47.520]   stem off some Missouri's and the security aid team and then tell them, yeah, no, we're not going
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:54.240]   to do that. We're going to do what's convenient for us. Hell with them. Just dump the people.
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:40:00.640]   They said they told Bloomberg, yeah, we did it because China asked us to. But we won't do that again.
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:08.640]   Yeah, right. I mean, to me, it kind of goes back to like from the beginning,
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:13.600]   the reason that I got mad at them last year was because like, I really think that they have a
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:19.920]   great product this. But from installing malware, and that's what they did to all of their security
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:26.000]   kind of talking out of both sides of their mouth, as as Ant said, to handing things over to and just
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:32.160]   doing the dirty work of the Chinese government and shutting off a US person's access.
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:40.560]   It just shows that they have always put growth hacking and getting more users and implicating
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:44.400]   others above the actual user base. And people pay for their product. Like, that's the thing.
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.560]   Like, you can't even say this is a Google type of thing where you're the product. No, people pay
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:53.680]   a lot of money for Zoom and Zoom has proven over and over and over again, I don't care who they
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:59.200]   hire. Like at a fundamental level with the company, they really care about getting more users and
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:04.400]   getting more contracts and making more money. And they don't care about the actual customers. And so
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:09.920]   for me, yeah, I won't use it. I mean, if I'm forced to, if somebody sends me a link with it,
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:15.840]   I'm obviously not going to not take the meeting because it's in Zoom. I'm not that hardcore,
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:20.480]   but I don't have an account. I won't give them my information. I'll use it only in a web browser.
[02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:21.920]   And I don't trust them. I just don't.
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:24.080]   Yeah.
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:31.200]   And when the key base acquisition happened, Mr. LaPorte was pretty pissed off about it.
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:34.320]   Yeah. You and I had just started connected on key base.
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:39.440]   Yeah. And I challenged you on being pissed off about it. But I see where you're coming from.
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:46.080]   You saw the history and you wasn't feeling it. And this right here is just looking like
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:48.240]   yet another point of proving you right.
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:48.720]   Yeah.
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:54.800]   Well, I was sad because I used key base, but far more people use Zoom than key base.
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:42:00.880]   So the net was a good thing if the key base guys were some of the best crypto guys in the world,
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:03.040]   go to Zoom and add that crypto.
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:08.000]   That then, okay, you know, the world's benefiting. I'm losing key base and I found
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:11.440]   replacements for it. So it's not the end of the world, but it actually was the stimulus to
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:17.120]   create the server over here and a new website so that I had my own controlled website.
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:23.200]   But and getting all that stuff. But when they I have to say, I've lost a little respect for
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:26.720]   Alex Stamos as well, he was defending this. Yeah.
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:34.160]   And you know, he was the security guy at Facebook who left when he found out about Cambridge Analytica
[02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:40.080]   because they didn't tell him. He was the security guy before that at Yahoo, who left because Yahoo
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:45.840]   didn't tell him about the billion record breach. Seems like Stamos, I don't know why he has such a
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:50.800]   good reputation. He's obviously very smart, but it seems like he's leaving burning buildings quickly.
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:55.280]   And I mean, and I got to wonder how the fire started under his watch, right?
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:57.440]   So say was he striking the match? Yeah.
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:03.760]   No, I mean, I mean, I love I like send a lot of ways because he's a good security guy,
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:09.360]   but he does have this uncanny knack of jumping out of the building just before it goes up in
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:16.960]   flight. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, and collecting the paychecks and signing the NDA is so he can't
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:24.720]   talk about it. So Alex got on Twitter and defended Zoom. But what he said was kind of interesting.
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:31.120]   He basically, if you go through all of these tweets defending him, he basically said,
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:41.360]   we designed a system for them, but we're not implementing it. So I wash my hands of it.
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:47.520]   The money, but you don't have to do it. Yeah, he doesn't have to do it. And then Zoom issued
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:55.760]   on June 4th, a statement that I think causes real cause for concern. They said, Zoom,
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:02.800]   Zoom's AES encryption is turned on for all Zoom users free and paid. Zoom does not proactively
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:08.880]   monitor meeting content. By the way, note that word proactively. Zoom does not proactively.
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:13.360]   In other words, we don't own our own monitor meeting content. We do not share information with
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:20.000]   law enforcement, except in circumstances like child sex abuse, who could argue against that?
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:26.320]   Except wait a minute. If you have end-end encryption, how could you share anything
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:32.080]   with law enforcement at all under any circumstance? We do not have back doors where participants can
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:37.200]   enter meetings without being visible to others. None of this will change. Zoom's end-to-end encryption
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:42.720]   plan balances the privacy of its users with the safety of vulnerable groups, including children
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:49.360]   and potential victims of hate crimes. They're basically saying, it's like,
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:55.040]   I do not think that term means what you think it means, end-to-end encryption. Ending an
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:01.440]   encryption means Zoom can't in any form or fashion see what you're doing. But they've said,
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:09.760]   unless there's child sexual activity abuse, then okay. But that means you have the keys.
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:17.360]   Right. I mean, look, it's not an invalid stance to take. Just don't call it into an encryption.
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:20.480]   Just don't call it into encryption. And I personally bothered and frankly,
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:27.600]   a little bit insulted by the rhetoric where they go, we care so much about privacy and safety
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:31.600]   of this group. And that's why we're going to work with law enforcement. Blackberry did the
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.360]   exact same things. >> Of course. >> And it's always think of the children.
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:38.000]   >> Always. >> Exactly. And it's like, okay, again,
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:44.080]   this is a valid stance to take to say we value working with law enforcement other than other
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:50.400]   groups. That's fine. But don't A try to gaslight us into what you're doing is actually
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:55.680]   the moral and noble thing. And B, claim that you have into an encryption when you obviously,
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:00.560]   by its very definition, do not. >> Yeah, I mean, it's the four horsemen of the
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:06.720]   Infocop, the Infocollips. So you've got pedophiles, organized crime, drug dealers and terrorists.
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:13.520]   And these are always the same excuses which are rolled out for saying, yeah, we should have the
[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:19.200]   right to say everyone's communications. And yeah, come on, we've grown beyond this.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.000]   >> Yeah, and I have to say, it's weird that Alex Stamos on the one hand says, oh yeah,
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:30.160]   there's end-to-end encryption. And then at the end, he says, "At no time to zoom turn over the
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:36.640]   encryption keys to law enforcement." Do they have the keys? At no time to zoom turn over the
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:40.960]   encryption keys to law enforcement, the issue here is whether Zoom's own employees can enter
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:48.160]   spaces they host, which is how all major trust and safety teams operate, and which is precluded by
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:55.920]   good E to E. But they have the keys so they can. So it's not good E to E. Alex, which is it?
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:04.000]   So I'm a little disheartened. I had higher opinion of Alex Stamos before this. And I have to say,
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:10.560]   look, everybody uses Zoom. I have to use Zoom. We use it at work because all our clients use Zoom
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:17.040]   and they want Zoom. I can't convince them to use Jitzy. Sorry, but I can't. I tried.
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:24.400]   So we have to live with it, but understand it is not end-to-end encrypted in the way that
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:30.240]   it's traditionally understood. They have the keys. No, period. Not also, period. And then, yeah,
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:35.440]   I agree with you, Christina. Then just say it. This is a legitimate stance. We have to have the keys.
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:42.000]   It is not end-to-end encrypted because we have to protect you. Is there any, and by the way,
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.000]   Stamos says, well, nobody else is end-to-end either. Yeah, but they're not claiming that they are.
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:47.360]   They're not claiming that. That makes you right.
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:53.600]   They're not telling themselves that. FaceTime is end-to-end one-to-one, right?
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:58.720]   Yeah. Is FaceTime group, are they group meetings? You can only go up to 32 people. Those are all
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:02.720]   encrypted end-to-end, right? Or does that not the keys? Yeah, but also, no, Apple doesn't have
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:07.440]   the keys in it, but also, yes, 32 people. And you can't share it with the web browser. And it's
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:10.560]   not-- Yeah, there are a lot of reasons. There are a lot of things you can't do if it's end-to-end
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:14.720]   encrypted. Right. Exactly. I mean, which is why the other, which is why the other services aren't.
[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:18.880]   When you're end-to-end encrypted, there are trade-offs. Right. And for most business use cases,
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:24.640]   those trade-offs are not worth it. Again, that's okay. And you can explain that. But to say,
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:32.640]   we have end-to-end encryption when you don't, it's disingenuous. And no one else is claiming
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:37.200]   that they have that low of security. And the reason you and I brought up that last year's story is
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:43.280]   because they were disingenuous then, too. It seems to be how they operate. So I don't trust them.
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:47.680]   The sad thing is, in for our business sales calls, who cares?
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:52.720]   So I'm listening in or what. I don't care. But there are therapists and psychiatrists and
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:49:00.400]   doctors who use Zoom to talk to patients. That's not secure. So don't.
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:07.120]   Now, I mean, my next-door neighbors on both sides, one is a teacher for grade school students,
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:12.560]   one is a music teacher on the other side. They rely on Zoom. Yeah. Oh, it really does.
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:19.120]   Yeah. When PG&E cut our twice down the last couple of weeks, PG&E has killed the internet
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:27.760]   access. That's that livelihood, God. So, you know, I don't know. We're all relying on this in an age
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:34.160]   of social distancing. Yeah. Well, just, I mean, it's okay. Because, I mean, honestly, messaging
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:40.640]   isn't secure in most cases. I can't convince everybody to use Signal. But if they want to be
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:46.720]   secure, they should use Signal. Definitely. But and understand that most other, you know,
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:52.800]   Apple messages is mostly secure. It's kind of secure enough. That's fine. Or Telegram, or,
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:56.640]   you know, it's fine. Just don't do it for stuff, you know, spy stuff.
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:50:01.760]   Yeah. And I think there's also, there is a difference when even if you don't have an
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:06.640]   hidden encryption and even if you're not like going that far, there is a big difference in
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:12.160]   basically saying, okay, a country reached out to us and said that someone who lives is
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:17.360]   residing in a different country is accessing a chat that we don't like and is going to be doing
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:22.240]   something and them intervening. Like that, that act right there. I'm sorry. That's really
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:26.960]   problematic to me. Yeah. I would be just as bothered if any of the other companies did that too,
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:32.160]   to be very clear, I'd be just as bothered. But the fact that like their response to that,
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:38.160]   which is basically like, oh, we won't do it again. Yeah. Based on all the other history of things,
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:42.960]   like if that was the first thing. Yeah. I mean, this was the very first thing, kind of like what
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:47.440]   you said, Leo, it's like we go back to what happened a year ago, because this is a pattern of behavior.
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:52.240]   And over time, like, at least to me, every scandal that's happened, they keep saying,
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:57.040]   we're sorry, we're sorry. It's very second. Isn't it? And then another scandal happens. And it
[02:50:57.040 --> 02:51:03.440]   becomes very clear. It's like, you're not sorry. You just don't care. And you're sorry, you got caught.
[02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:09.600]   That's sorry. And I have to correct you. It's not honest engine. It's honest first nations. Okay.
[02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:14.560]   Let's get that right. Yeah, no, I know. And I appreciate it. And you're right.
[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:20.880]   It's just hard. You old habits die hard. And I wasn't really writing on you.
[02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:26.880]   Exactly. But aren't. No, no, no, no, exactly. It's just these things carry on. And it's
[02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:33.840]   up to us to actually make a change and say, look, yes, it was our history. Now let's move on.
[02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:43.040]   Here's some really good news. I know I've been plugging this amazing video game bundle deal from
[02:51:43.040 --> 02:51:54.560]   itch.io. 1,705 games now for $5 independent 1300 independent creators. Donate their games.
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:52:00.720]   It was to raise money for racial justice and equality. The money was divided 5050 between
[02:52:00.720 --> 02:52:06.640]   the NAACP legal defense and education fund and the community bail fund. Their goal was $5 million.
[02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:12.080]   They have to date raise $6.7 million.
[02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:17.440]   All of us. That's what's up. Nice. And they're still a bit ago. Let's get it to 10 kids.
[02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:22.960]   Yeah. I mean, what a deal. Look at all the games. I mean, it goes on and on and on. It's not just
[02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:27.760]   games, it's content, it's all sorts of stuff. Any one of these games would be worth $5.
[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:35.680]   But how about 1,700 of them? This is what's been really interesting about the internet in
[02:52:35.680 --> 02:52:42.560]   terms of fundraising. Yeah. I mean, Bernie Sanders ran an entire presidential campaign
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:49.040]   based on microtransactions. Games are now, you know, you can't sell a game unless you've got
[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:54.160]   microtransactions in there. It's these small amounts of money that add up to something really big.
[02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:59.440]   Go for it. Yeah. I think it's so great. And it's what's really interesting is for all the
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:05.120]   guff gamers get and the heat and the negative attention gamers consistently,
[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:09.760]   this has happened again and again have donated huge amounts to good causes.
[02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:15.520]   They pony up when time comes. And obviously we see those again and again on Twitch. We've
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:24.000]   seen it here. It's really pretty impressive. I T C H dot I O. There's a day and a few hours left
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:28.720]   if you want to help out. I think that's great. And you know what? Most people spend more than
[02:53:28.720 --> 02:53:34.880]   $5. The average contribution is $10. I think that's really cool. Really, really cool.
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:41.200]   Aunt Pruitt, you're really cool. Hands on photography, hands on wellness. He's on Instagram and
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:48.400]   underscore Pruitt. And we love you and we're so glad you're here. And I'm so glad to see
[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:56.480]   Isaac's poster behind you. Isaac Jacob, Jacob, sorry, Jacob. Jacob's the young one.
[02:53:56.480 --> 02:54:03.200]   Jacob's the middle schooler, right? Isaac's. Jacob, Jacob and Isaiah, the two hard kids.
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:13.600]   Sorry. I got the I part. You did. Hashtag Isaiah, not Isaac. Okay.
[02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:20.800]   Rashtag Black Lives Matter. No justice, no peace. Right on. Hashtag we matter. That's awesome.
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:25.600]   That's right. That's beautiful. Thank you for allowing us to share this message. And
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:33.600]   thank you to you and Mrs. LePort for taking a stand and taking a side and saying,
[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:39.360]   you know what? We're against this bull crap of racism and openly putting it out there to
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:44.640]   everyone in the Twitter audience. It really does. For a long time. Amplify the message.
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:50.960]   Yeah. We really, I really wanted to kind of stay apolitical because I thought, well, we're the
[02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:59.200]   toy store. But sometimes something comes along. You can't sit back. Yeah. Go and take a side.
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:07.040]   You got to take a side. And I'm just so proud of our company and our team. Because and you and
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:15.040]   Micah, our two black employees, it does matter. And sometimes you just have to take a stand.
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:19.520]   And you know what we get heat for it, but I don't care. Like Jeff Bezos said, he don't like it.
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:25.680]   Screw you. That's right. I've said it a gazillion times that, you know, I can
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:34.400]   present my message every single day. But it's not as amplified if it's if it's not coming from
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:42.320]   someone like you. We're glad to amplify your message. Or the other non-colored listeners
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:47.360]   out here in the Twitter network. Because that's that's who's going to help us get that message
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:52.720]   amplified and help lead this society to a better change. Great. We all have to stand up for justice.
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:56.320]   It's just the right thing to do. Thank you, Ant. I really appreciate it. Thank you.
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:03.440]   And I also think English lives matter. Yes. But not as much. I just want to say.
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:07.440]   They clearly had the best breakfast. Definitely have the worst breakfast.
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:14.800]   No, no, we have we have the great breakfast. We also have learned from America as the great
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:19.920]   how it's inputted. You can't say neutral on a moving train. So let's get this thing done.
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:25.280]   Yeah. How it's in the people's history of the United States is a must read. I don't know why
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:29.680]   they don't touch it. Oh, yes. They really ought to. Maybe they do now. I hope they do.
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:38.400]   Thank you, Ian, the register.com. He's at Ian Thompson spelled properly. I a I and T H O M S O N.
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:43.520]   But although for some reason the Americans seem to think that's it lane. Who is called lane?
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:49.600]   No, it's not lame. It's an I. He's got more letters than he ought to in the first name, fewer letters
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:53.600]   than he ought in the last name. That's all you need to remember. He's Ian Thompson. Thank you, Ian.
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:57:04.720]   His past participle Thompson. Past part. I have lane. I did lane. Past participle Thompson. I like it.
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:11.600]   You have a new name, Ian. I'm almost to get that tattoo. I don't think it would fit on those scrunny
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:17.200]   biceps. You got to do some lifting first. Yeah, true. I need to get those going. Hey,
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:21.760]   it's so great to see you film girl. You're awesome. I'm glad we got the right. What happened to the
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:26.160]   camera die? I don't know. No, it was overheating for some reason. I think because of the light coming
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:31.200]   in. That's why those cameras turn off after 30 minutes. They say the chip gets too. Yeah. And
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:34.960]   there might be a setting that I need to change because I've been using it for zoom calls for
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:39.840]   weeks and it's been fine, but I'll figure it out. But yeah, there it is. By the way, that in a nutshell
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:44.560]   is the entire tech community. We hate zoom, but I've been you as in zoom calls for weeks.
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:50.720]   And actually, I mean, teams calls and see this is the problem. Oh,
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:55.520]   Oh, yeah, no, I'm not even on zoom calls. I'm on team's calls. But yeah,
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:59.600]   no one knows what you're talking about. I say I'm on a team's call. What do you mean, zoom? Yeah,
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:04.800]   yeah, zoom. Yeah, I'm like, same thing. Whatever. Same thing, whatever. I might be the one person.
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:11.920]   She is great on rocket. You can find that on relay FM. She is great wherever she goes. Channel 9,
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:16.720]   Microsoft senior cloud advocate. And of course, on the Twitter film on your score girl. Is
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:21.440]   anything else you want to plug that I haven't? No, I mean, I think that's, I think that's it.
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:27.840]   Just a black lives matter. That's that's my one right on. Yeah. Yep. Thank you, lady. Right on.
[02:58:27.840 --> 02:58:33.600]   Thank you. I love you guys. Thank you for being here. And we'll see you next time.
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:45.120]   Another twist. Do the Twitter. Maybe. Do the Twitter. All right.
