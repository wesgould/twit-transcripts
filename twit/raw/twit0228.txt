[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.760]   It's time for Twit this week in tech, this decade in tech.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.920]   Our year-end-er, our decade-end-er.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.760]   This is exciting.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.200]   We've got videos from all the Twits and a lot of Twit
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.760]   listeners and viewers.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.000]   Let's start with the Twits who are on the show today.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.240]   And I'm going to start with in the upper right-hand corner
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.880]   of our Hollywood Squares.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.080]   Robert Scobol of the Scobolizer blog and building43.com.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.000]   Hi, Robert.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.760]   Hey, Mary.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.560]   Merry Christmas, Mary.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.000]   Merry Christmas.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.240]   You're a good guy to have on to talk
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.600]   about the big stories of the decade,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.480]   because you were the guru of social media.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.680]   I don't know about that.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.560]   Certainly, I'm the president.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.560]   You just reduced my salary by about 50%.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.200]   That's true.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.680]   That's true.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.560]   Also, we're just really glad to have
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.840]   one of the original Twits on the show today, Kevin Rose,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.360]   from dig.com, another visionary who
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.640]   has changed the world of technology news and news in general.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.680]   Hey, Robert.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.200]   Hey.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.880]   OK, Robert, you have to wave to the--
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.840]   yeah, that's--
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.560]   there you go.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.600]   Yeah, high-fiving each other.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.800]   A Brady Bunch moment, I must say.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.880]   I hope you do see the video, folks.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.840]   So Kevin's at home in Vegas at his family's home.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.800]   And thank you for spending a little time with us
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.320]   after Christmas.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.000]   Absolutely.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.840]   Have you all this?
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.240]   Do you have a good holiday, Kevin?
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.360]   Yeah, great one.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.880]   It's nice.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.880]   It's fun to get out and see the family.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.000]   We're going to be going back down to Vegas for a CES.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.880]   You going down for CES?
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.280]   I think I'm going to stay for the Apple event, actually.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   OK.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.760]   OK, that's a good question.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.520]   That's a good question.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.320]   The ninth and 10th, Apple is 26th, is Apple, right?
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.440]   So that's the big stir.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.200]   Before we get to the looking back--
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   That's next decade, though.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.160]   I thought this really was--
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.520]   We should look ahead.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.000]   So now the rumor is-- and it's still just
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.600]   at the stage of a rumor that Apple has
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.160]   reserved their Bewina Center, where they traditionally
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.240]   hold their iPod events.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.440]   It's the 26th of January?
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.840]   That's the day?
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   I believe so.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880]   Let me double check.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.440]   I don't have to say it.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.640]   But that's a rumor.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.480]   But I'm not surprised that that's leaked out
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.920]   when you book a venue like that.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.720]   Of course, a lot of people know about it.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.360]   It's more than a rumor.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.280]   A guy who knows Steve Jobs has told me about the tablet.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.040]   And he says it's going to be one of those products that Steve
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.840]   has actually worked on for years.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.320]   And my brother-in-law worked at Apple for a while.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.240]   And he knew about the tablet three years ago.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.920]   So--
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.120]   They've been working on its power PC.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.600]   They've been working on its power PC.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.080]   I mean, there's no question about that.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.560]   The New York Times this week reported an Apple employee
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.400]   saying Steve's really happy with the tablet at this point.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.000]   The same guy told me this might be Steve's last major project
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.480]   as well.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.240]   So you know who this guy is.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.840]   It was--
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It'll be interesting to see who--
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.800]   I don't know who was quoted in New York Times.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.440]   I have my other--
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.360]   Oh, your source, I see.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.080]   But I know.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.640]   It'll be interesting to see what Steve says about that.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.840]   Steve, from what this guy who knows Steve--
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   Well, it told me it was a lot closer to death
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.440]   than a lot of us know about.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.920]   Oh, dear.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.400]   And he's--
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.920]   Is this his legacy?
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.040]   That's going to be what will be interesting to see
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.200]   if that evolves his story over the next month.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.760]   Kevin, you have excellent Apple sources.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.640]   Have you heard anything?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.840]   Other than it's just going to be the Kindle killer.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.240]   That's what I keep hearing over and over again.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.440]   It's more like interactive books.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.400]   And it's going to be--
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.840]   My source said to me, expect to see a lot of kindles
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.160]   on eBay the day after the announcement.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160]   Wow.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.680]   So--
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.480]   Wow.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.600]   It's-- you know, the other quote--
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.400]   there's your Kindle--
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.000]   Get ready for the sell now.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I like Kindle.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   You may want to buy it.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.680]   We'll actually--
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.800]   The other quote is that you will be amazed by the user interface
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.640]   and it's not what you expect.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.480]   What does that say to you, Kevin?
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   What does that mean?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.040]   That says buy Apple stock.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.760]   Well, apparently Wall Street agreed,
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.360]   because Apple has soared to a new high
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.200]   and is doing very well in the stock market.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.080]   Apple, you think it'll be the ice slate?
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   That's the other rumor is that they've--
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.720]   Yeah, it's the New York Times drop there, right?
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   One of your speeches.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.560]   One of the guys let's slip the ice late as the name.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.720]   But I'm excited.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.120]   I think that there's a lot of things you could do
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.480]   when it comes to like e-book readers.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.720]   We're very much like--
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.200]   you know, it's still--
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.120]   the Amazon book is very much page to page.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.360]   No social interactions, no sharing.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.640]   It's just-- I think there's so much more they could do there.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.320]   Somebody said--
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.840]   Somebody said-- thought that the UI might have something
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.320]   to do with the camera on the front and just articulating.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.080]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.400]   I bought this after the other day and I'm reading it.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.240]   It's not even an app.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.600]   It's really a book done by the guy who started CSI.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.280]   It's one of the most expensive apps you'll--
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.080]   What's it called?
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.360]   Levi-- what is it?
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.400]   Level 26.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.960]   Level 26.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.760]   And it's an e-book.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.280]   So let me try to click in here.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.760]   But it's--
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.200]   How much was it?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.640]   How much was it?
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.680]   It was $13, which is-- if you're comparing it
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.960]   to a book on the Kindle, it's more comparable to a book.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.360]   But it's expensive for an iPhone app.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.160]   But they're talking with Apple or working with Apple
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.560]   on getting this kind of content on the tablet.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.760]   So imagine you have a bigger display surface.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.000]   Imagine you have ability to look at--
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.760]   you notice there's a video here?
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.200]   I can't unlock it because I haven't read down to that yet.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.120]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.920]   This is sent by the guy who started CSI.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.720]   So they're looking at ways to make books that
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.000]   are interactive that have not just text.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.560]   Let me get back into the text here.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.840]   Not just text with beautiful text.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.480]   And from what my source at Apple told me
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.120]   was look at the quartz APIs because those are all text handling
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.720]   APIs.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.880]   And he said this is the first device that will really
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.320]   use the quartz APIs in any major way.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.520]   So imagine a device that has some new way to swipe and look
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.400]   at text along with video and along with graphics
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.720]   like chemistry textbooks.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.520]   Apple's going through the textbook market as well with this.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.400]   The ability to have embedded rich media and then also
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.320]   to annotate on top of certain paragraphs
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.120]   that you find interesting, share those with friends.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.600]   If I'm reading down a certain page
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   and I see a friend's icon pop up on some text
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.760]   that they've read and wanted to leave a comment on,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.520]   I mean, these are all things that we can do now,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.720]   obviously, with the net.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.480]   I hope Apple's including that in this first release.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.200]   Kind of makes sense that Apple would be involved in eBooks
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.680]   because they're so good at content--
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.520]   soup to nuts content starting with music
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.800]   that they would have an ebook store and all that stuff.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.360]   But Amazon's got 650,000 books on there.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.520]   How are they going to compete against that?
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.600]   Well, I mean, look at what--
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.120]   well, you're at the Amazon--
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.520]   their announcement on Christmas, right?
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.320]   They actually sold more eBooks, physical books,
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.160]   for the first time.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.920]   And the Kindle was their number one selling product.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.120]   I mean, it's clearly that if you're going to say one thing that
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.720]   happened in 2009 or is that the ebook came of age,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.760]   but Apple could turn this all on its head.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.840]   But see, it seems to me that's just one part of what
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.880]   an isolate might be.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.960]   It also would be a surfing platform, right?
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.600]   It's going to have always on web, always on internet.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.440]   Well, and what about a remote control for your TV system?
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.200]   I use my iPhone as a remote control for the Sonos.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.800]   It makes a great remote control.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.520]   In fact, I use it for the Apple TV.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.760]   It makes a great remote control.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.280]   So yeah.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.680]   But also video could be interactive--
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.400]   get even more interactive where you're playing games along
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.160]   with TV shows because on your surface up front,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.840]   you have fun things you could do with the family
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.160]   while watching TV.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.560]   Anything surprising in the isolate?
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.080]   You guys want to make any predictions?
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.440]   I'm sure there will be something--
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.600]   I mean, we saw the patent for a new kind of keyboard that
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.360]   actually looks like a piece of glass,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.800]   but has some sort of feedback to your finger
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.480]   so that you know--
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.680]   Some sort of haptic feedback.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.640]   That's what I was really kind of concerned with in a way,
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.160]   is that I really want--
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.120]   obviously, the e-paper is a big deal
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.080]   because you can read without your eyes getting strained,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.400]   like you get on the Kindle.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.800]   And I'm assuming that this is going to be some type of like OLE
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.480]   or something like that.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.240]   I'm wondering if they're going to run into like,
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.320]   eye-strain problems, but then I was thinking, well,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   you know, I'm on my laptop for eight hours a day.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.760]   My eyes really don't get strained on that so much.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.920]   So I don't know.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.680]   What do you guys think of this?
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.920]   I like the idea of a bright, you know,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.120]   backlit color display that's more interactive
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.880]   than the Kindle.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.720]   The Kindle's not very interactive, you know?
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.400]   It's a page turn.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.200]   Keep in mind this technology is not--
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.800]   is using little balls that turn.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.240]   Right.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.760]   And that's why it uses so little power
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.440]   because it's not shining a light through.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.200]   I think people have overplayed the fact
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.880]   that you can go weeks without a battery.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.080]   I think we're already used to charging up our devices
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.760]   every day now.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.840]   So the idea that it goes weeks big deal,
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.520]   I'll plug it in at night.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.440]   Right?
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.920]   Doesn't bother me.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.000]   I use my Kindle very little to tell you the truth.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I use my iPhone.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.440]   I use it every night.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.080]   I actually just Kindle on my iPhone more than I use Kindle
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.480]   on the Kindle.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.120]   Apple's going to have to make some deals, though,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.720]   with the big publishers.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.920]   Maybe it's a periodical reading device.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.080]   Kindle is not very good for magazines and newspapers
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.240]   because it's for turning pages.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.640]   It's not for what you got, the National Geographic.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.680]   Is that a Kindle version?
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.040]   I have every single issue of the National Geographic.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.960]   Oh, and a hard drive.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.080]   Wow.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.560]   $200 on a hard drive.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.400]   Wow.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.080]   This would be a perfect thing to put on a tablet.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.480]   The UI is sort of goofy.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.840]   So if Steve Jobs got a hold of this UI,
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.000]   you would redo it.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Yeah, Mad Magazine broke my heart.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.640]   They released every copy of Mad.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.600]   You know, the first 500 copies of Mad.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.680]   And UI, they're all PDFs.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.320]   Let me try to plug it in so it's so crappy.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.600]   And in fact, you missed the marginalia
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.560]   because it's covered.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.600]   Oh, it's just awful.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   Can you fold the back page anyway?
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.920]   What good is that?
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.720]   Let's-- one of the things we're going to do today
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.480]   is we're going to hear from many of the tweets, many
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.760]   of our tweet listeners about the big stories of the year gone by.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.960]   It turns out there's a pretty big story ahead.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.280]   I think it's worth covering.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.320]   But we can also look back to-- so Robert,
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.640]   while you're setting up National Geographic,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:58.320]   let me get Patrick Norton and his video on the line here.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.640]   These are Patrick's thoughts about the year and the decade gone
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   by.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.920]   Hey, Leo, everybody in the Twit cottage
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.360]   and everybody out there in the Twit army.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.120]   My story of the decade, Moore's Law
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.760]   applies to everything.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.000]   And my dog's running away.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.800]   I'm better than happening.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.560]   They at the airport.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.440]   I'm thinking that's about an iPhone that
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.480]   does more for my wife over the holidays than my first computer
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.120]   did.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.880]   And I'm sending the video to you over wireless ethernet.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.960]   Mostly I'm stoked without far wireless comms
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.840]   and how cheap everything keeps getting.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.040]   I just want people to put mufflers on their phones.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.240]   Happy end of the decade.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.920]   You guys can see, yes.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.840]   Happy end of the decade, Patrick.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.360]   I like how he's got a muddy shirt.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.080]   I don't know what he would love to before he left that message.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.120]   He's just had breakfast or something.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.840]   Patrick is such a--
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.200]   That's classic Patrick though, right?
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.120]   Classic Patrick.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.800]   He's out somewhere where there's motors, got mud on himself.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.000]   But he makes a very good point.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.640]   I mean, that's absolutely true.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.600]   He's not the only one who thought that.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.920]   Let me see if I can get Randall Schwartz's video on here too.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.680]   Randall is the host of Floss Weekly.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.200]   He also thought that Moore's Law was the big story.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.360]   Now, ironically, Moore's Law is 40 years old.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.840]   So it's not really this decade.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.200]   But what happens when things double every 18 months
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.640]   is that it starts to get faster and faster and faster and faster.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.560]   And Moore's Law means that you're
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.640]   going to see a lot next year too.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.400]   You got the National Geographic up?
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.320]   So here's an issue from 1972.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.520]   And they've scanned in every single page, including the ads
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.800]   and everything.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.640]   And you can just page through it.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.600]   Imagine you had this on a tablet and you could just use your hand
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.040]   to swipe over it.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.560]   Do you think you don't have that?
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.520]   You know, the Tom Cruise hand swipe.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.920]   If it's Apple and it's touch free, it's going to have candy,
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.200]   right?
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.920]   They love the candy interfaces.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.920]   They could.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.480]   I mean, I've seen that at Microsoft using a camera.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.720]   A camera can tell where your hand is.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.240]   So using a device with a camera and just swiping over it
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.240]   would be fairly easy technologically to do.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.400]   Actually, you have something like that for iTunes.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.960]   It was just a little dumb download for iTunes that did that.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.680]   So anyways, this is $200 for the hard drive.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.960]   And you get every single issue of the National Geographic.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.000]   That's funny.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.720]   How big is the hard drive?
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.840]   I don't even know.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.520]   It doesn't say on it.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.360]   I guess I could do Control-I on it.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.560]   That's a hoot.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.520]   That is a crack up.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.160]   It's pretty nice.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.280]   You can search for things.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.560]   You can zoom in.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.840]   And you know, it's pretty--
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.640]   Trying to find Randall's--
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.920]   Shoot, it's not on the list here.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.280]   So Randall had the same point about Moore's law.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.080]   You guys have any thoughts about that?
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.640]   How are we--
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.000]   It's only a 64 gig drive.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.160]   Oh.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.720]   That's why they can make it cheap.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:06.120]   Is it on this list?
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.280]   Yeah, Merlin.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.720]   There it is.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:14.080]   That's why he's using his gnom de plume, Merlin.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.400]   Hi.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.200]   This is Randall Schwartz, host of Floss Weekly.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.520]   What I think the big technology story
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.880]   is for the first decade of the new millennium
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.840]   is the fact that we're in the fourth decade of Moore's law,
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.800]   where everything gets smaller, faster, and cheaper,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.520]   doubles every 18 to 24 months.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.520]   I think this is amazing because we've
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.040]   had exponential growth for four decades.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.520]   And we're starting our fifth decade.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.520]   It looks like there's no end in sight.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.040]   It's this technology increase that's
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.360]   enabling all these other things, like ubiquitous internet
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.200]   and social media and being able to share videos
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.120]   and rich media instead of having to just simply type
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.960]   text characters at each other.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   This is what's amazing to me is that we're continuing to do this.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.040]   And every time it looks like we're topping out,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.640]   we come up with some new technology,
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.160]   like smaller transistors, optical transistors,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.680]   molecular transistors I just heard last week,
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.920]   really amazing stuff.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.600]   So I think that's got to be the fact
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.320]   that we're in our fourth decade going on our fifth decade
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.960]   of Moore's law.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.800]   And of course, it's just going to accelerate faster
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.680]   and faster and faster.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.240]   I thought it's very interesting to watch Patrick's bit
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.360]   because look at all the technology he's using.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.160]   He kind of brought this up.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.520]   He was using an EVDO modem.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.080]   So he had internet out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.920]   He has video.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.480]   He has audio recording.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.000]   I mean, he can record it on the internet
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.160]   and we can get it on the internet instantaneously.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.200]   He recorded it just an hour ago.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.160]   I mean, we're seeing all this stuff converge
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.080]   in a kind of an amazing way.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.480]   One of the coolest tours I ever did was IBM's research
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.320]   in new Almadin and the new Almadin research labs
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.600]   where they let me move a single atom,
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.640]   an iron atom across a piece of copper.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.920]   And they're doing research to try to find new ways
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.200]   of storing data in even smaller spaces than we can today.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.840]   - We can thank the Almadin research labs for our hard drives.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.520]   It was there the Winchester disk was invented
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.720]   and I think really perfected.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.960]   So yeah, they have the first hard drive city
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.800]   in the lobby.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.640]   It's pretty cool.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.560]   - Pretty amazing.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.000]   Did you guys have been in the computer history museum?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.840]   - That's fantastic.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.840]   - I haven't been down there yet.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.680]   - That's so awesome.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.000]   - Yeah, when Bell started that,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.120]   she's since passed away, Gordon Bell's wife,
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.880]   but yeah, that's supposed to be an amazing place.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.720]   - That's great.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.160]   - But they don't have the first hard drive.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.160]   (laughing)
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.520]   - It was, it's pretty big, isn't it?
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.320]   I mean, it's like a refrigerator.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.160]   - Yeah.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.440]   - And it only was like five kilobytes.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.640]   - And they put the surface on.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.080]   - Wait a minute, say that again, not five gigabytes,
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.920]   not five megabytes.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.760]   - Five kilobytes.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.600]   - Five kilobytes.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.160]   - And the platters are huge,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.720]   like the size of this table.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.440]   And they put the surface on it
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.040]   by pouring it out of coffee cups
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.760]   while the thing was spinning
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.960]   and it would spread over the surface.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.040]   - Another big story,
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.840]   you're gonna be flying home, Kevin, in a little bit.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.760]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.120]   - You may want to pee before the last hour of the flight
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.080]   because after this clown from Nigeria
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.320]   set off explosives in the plane,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.480]   the Delta plane to Detroit,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.120]   the TSA regulations changed yesterday.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.280]   And I was watching Jeannie Jardin
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.040]   as she tweeted this from her Air Canada flight.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.720]   And she said that the flight attendants
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.880]   were a little chagrin, they were not happy about this.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.840]   The news is you cannot get up in the last hour of the flight.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   You cannot have anything in your lap,
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.920]   even a book, let alone a laptop or a Kindle,
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.880]   that you can't touch your baggage.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.200]   You're basically, you might as well have your hands
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.880]   in the air for the last hour of the flight.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.200]   - Yeah, our terror is gonna wait for the last hour.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.040]   - It's crazy.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.640]   Bruce and I are the great security expert.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.720]   That's the first thing he said,
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.480]   oh, okay, that's gonna work.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.240]   But he said all along that our TSA,
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.560]   our flight security is really about theater,
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.720]   not about security.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.560]   - Totally.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.880]   - Crazy.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.720]   - Totally.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.560]   - Did you see the myth show?
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.400]   What do you call it?
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.240]   - Mythbusters.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.080]   - Mythbusters.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.720]   They were showing how to blow up things using flour.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.560]   - Oh.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.640]   - And flour and air and light a match.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.960]   (laughs)
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.440]   - I mean, it's crazy.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   I think Bruce helped a Atlantic monthly writer last year
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.040]   break pretty much every law
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.280]   by sneaking knives, scissors,
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.720]   using false passports.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.080]   He had a Hezbollah flag and a death to the infidel's t-shirt.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.240]   I mean, the guy, it was like,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.800]   they didn't stop him for anything.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.760]   It's not about security.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.880]   It's about theater.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.240]   It's about making you think you're secure.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.080]   - Yeah.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.560]   - Yeah.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.360]   - And I, you know, it'd be very interesting to watch
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.480]   because I'll tell you what,
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.320]   forget not going to the bathroom in the last hour.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.600]   You try to take people's kindles and laptops away
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.520]   in the last hour or cell phones.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:59.120]   Let's get another video in here.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.480]   This is from Dan Patterson,
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.960]   who's been on Twitch before,
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.280]   works for ABC News.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.200]   Dan left a message via Bitly.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.640]   - Hey, my name is Dan Patterson.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.840]   I'm a content manager and correspondent.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.360]   And my theory on the story of the decade
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.920]   isn't so much one story,
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.200]   but it's this series of ideas that have coalesced
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   and really created something that is very unique to humans.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.480]   And that is the reduction in the distance
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.160]   and friction between people, other people, and information.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.320]   And if you buy the arguments
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.160]   that people are inherently social,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.880]   humans are inherently curious,
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.480]   and we're all inherently lazy.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.640]   And by that, I mean, we like efficiencies
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.520]   in how we get information.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.040]   If you buy that argument,
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.640]   then you buy the tools that allow people
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.520]   to reduce the distance and friction
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.680]   between people, other people, and information,
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.800]   will inherently be successful.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.240]   And because we like efficiency
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.560]   in the delivery of our curiosities,
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.960]   what we've seen is the growth in companies,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   but really companies that are propelled by ideas.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.200]   And it warms my geek little heart
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.840]   to see idea companies propagate.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.600]   So beyond the tech gossip and the stories
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.680]   that we follow in a cycle year after year,
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.800]   I think the biggest story of the decade
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.080]   was the emergence of organic ideas
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.680]   and how they can propagate and bring people together.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.560]   So I'm Dan Patterson.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.600]   That's my two cents.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.440]   Thanks.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.080]   - You're kind of an expert on that, Kevin.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.120]   I mean, that's a lot about what Dig is all about,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.280]   is using people power to propagate ideas
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.160]   and to choose the ideas that get propagated.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.200]   - Well, not only that, but I think that,
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.400]   you know, I moved out to San Francisco back in 2000
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.760]   in the first dot-com boom.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.800]   - Oh, so this has been your decade?
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.120]   - Well, I'm just, no, what I'm saying is
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.600]   that if you wanted to start a company back in 2000 though,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.440]   I mean, it was a lot more difficult than it is today.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.160]   I mean, you'd actually have to go out
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.080]   and buy dedicated servers.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.760]   And there was no Amazon S3, there was no EC2.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.240]   And to get an idea off the ground today
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.440]   or even just a few years ago or over this last decade,
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.600]   it's been, the barrier to entry has been lowered quite a bit
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.160]   to where, you know, if you have something,
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.760]   you have something new that you wanna explore,
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.480]   it really is, you know, a couple thousand dollars
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   to get something off the ground and launch it.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.520]   - But that's a really good point.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.200]   That's completely changed everything, hasn't it?
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.680]   - Absolutely, especially the way that we scale websites.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.600]   I mean, it was really difficult back in the day.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.200]   And the fact that you can go and just launch new server
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.800]   instances over in milliseconds, depending on what the load
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.320]   is of your current site based on EC2,
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.840]   it's like, it's just so much easier than it was,
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.320]   even just a few years ago.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.600]   - And Rackspace.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.640]   - And Rackspace says, "Rockspace employee,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.120]   "Robert Scoble."
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.640]   - What I was putting up on screen right here is a,
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.800]   is a Twitter room or a Twitter list of a bunch of people
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.760]   who are covering the Iranian protests.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.480]   And this was pretty difficult to do even a year ago.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.640]   And now we can see 346 people all who are covering
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.040]   the Iranian protests, most of whom are actually in Iran.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.840]   It's pretty amazing that we can connect to each other
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.680]   in this way.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.760]   - I think that was a story, in many ways,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.960]   a story of the years of the Iranian rebellion in Twitter.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.360]   And of course, it's flared up again this week.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.520]   But Mumbai, I mean, a lot of things.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.080]   Twitter became, in many ways, a news source,
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.400]   which is a very strange thing,
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.240]   almost an unpredicted thing that this kind of trivial
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.400]   140 character thing would become a news source.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.960]   I call it the internet nervous system.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.680]   I mean, it really is starting to become the way that,
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.200]   the ganglia that we communicate with each other.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.520]   And it has reduced the friction of communication considerably.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.280]   You used to have to blog this stuff, you know,
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.880]   or you'd have to find a blog,
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.440]   you'd have to go to the blog, you'd have to Google it.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.800]   Now it's all there.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.400]   You just follow this real-time stream.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.960]   - Yeah, I have another list of world news brands,
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.960]   218 news brands from like Wall Street Journal, CNN,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.200]   New York Times and others.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.480]   And they are all flowing into a stream here.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.080]   And you get to keep up to date on the world as--
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.360]   - Kevin, I get the sense that the dig
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.960]   is gonna go a little bit real time soon.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.080]   - Yeah, I mean, we do real-time trend detection right now.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.240]   So we'll actually promote stories up in the front page
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.080]   for people to vote on,
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.400]   based on how many incoming submissions there are.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.640]   But we have some deep integrations
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.120]   coming with a bunch of different players
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.200]   and some big announcements in the next few months.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.040]   So--
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.200]   - Every time Kevin's audience got a big announcement
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.240]   that he can't talk about.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.640]   But I think that's the nature of dig.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.280]   You're always kind of reinventing it
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.120]   and coming, going along.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.800]   And clearly real-time is where it's happening now.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.560]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that what we have to do
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.080]   is the company is we have to take a look
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.640]   at all the different sources of information
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.440]   and kind of just act as Switzerland and sit there.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.400]   And if we're seeing a trend happen in Twitter,
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.360]   you know, we can map that to the best stories on dig.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.480]   And if there's other things happening on Facebook,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   another network's wanna be able to pull all that in
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.000]   and kind of do that one. - That's it.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.840]   That's it.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.200]   So you see yourself as an aggregator.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.560]   - Absolutely, we see ourselves as like a neutral Switzerland
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.200]   where we'll sit there and we can be able to pull in
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.560]   all different types of data information
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.400]   from all around the world.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.320]   - I like that model a lot.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.200]   I mean, you see Google's new real-time displays
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.680]   in search result pages as a competitor to dig
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   or a potential competitor to dig.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.760]   - The problem with Google's displays
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.960]   is that they're largely unfiltered.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.560]   So like you'll be sitting there and you'll do a search
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.320]   on something and you'll get whoever just happened
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.240]   to last send a comment. - Yeah.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.640]   - So really what you kind of have to do is you have to take
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.760]   a look at who those users are, how much authority they have
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.360]   on that topic and then be able to rank them
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.320]   within that inside that community.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.480]   So really kind of like the way that Google applies page rank
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.000]   to individual web pages, we're kind of looking
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.480]   at the same thing when it comes to humans.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.720]   So how can we say how much influence someone has
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.560]   in a given area?
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.160]   I was doing a lot of that on We Follow,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.800]   some of the Twitter directory that I started.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.120]   It's actually ranked not by follower count,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.000]   but now based on how much influence they have in that tab.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.240]   - I noticed that, which helped me a lot.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.960]   By the way, thank you.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.080]   'Cause I could-- - It's just one gives a map.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.680]   Yeah, it boosted your way up.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.080]   - I got a lot higher on the ranking than before.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.240]   But so it's two parts, it's aggregation,
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.000]   but it's also curation.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.920]   - And the real question and the question Google asks
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.400]   and you ask is can you automate either
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.160]   or does it have to be human powered?
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.440]   - Well, also it needs to be a picture.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.560]   - It's human power behind the scenes, right?
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.040]   Like all of the tweets and all the data that we have coming
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.640]   in is obviously all from individuals.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.360]   As is it with page rank?
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.440]   I mean, if you think about page rank,
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.920]   it is actually physically humans creating links
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.320]   to other websites. - That's true.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.840]   - So they were really the first one
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.760]   to kind of assign authority to individuals, right?
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.000]   They call it web pages, but it was really individuals
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.200]   and humans that were placing those links.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.120]   - Yeah, what I was showing you before was a Ron protest,
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.040]   a search on Google for a Ron protest.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.200]   You can see some of them look really authoritative.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.080]   Like there's an NPR link in there.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.960]   What we're talking about is this area here
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.480]   that has real time feeds put into it.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.840]   But who the heck is this guy?
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.240]   And he says, "A Ron protests again,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.680]   "many deaths watch oil."
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.200]   That doesn't help anybody. - No, it's horrible.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.640]   In fact, it's like, it's a stock tip.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.960]   - So it strikes me that's one thing
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.520]   Google has not done very well,
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.720]   is harness authority or harness human power?
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.360]   - They're a very engineering driven
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.920]   kind of A/B testing organization.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.400]   They were, if you think back
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.520]   onto kind of the early start of web 2.0
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.720]   and who was really active in this space
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.560]   and from an acquisition standpoint,
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.680]   it was really kind of Yahoo, right?
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.880]   They were the ones buying the flickers and delicious
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.360]   and really looking like the emerging leaders
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.880]   and actually they were the first ones
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.920]   to have the human power directory that they launched with.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.000]   So it's kind of a shame in my eyes
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.680]   to see them kind of fall off.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.880]   And now Google's kind of starting to play with that,
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.760]   but they're playing catch up to Facebook.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.000]   If you take a look at the features
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.240]   and features they've been launching
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.120]   over the last six months to a year,
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.160]   it's all been different ways to combat Facebook's growth.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.200]   - Yep, Heather Gold has something to say about that.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.040]   She's the host of Tummel Talk on one of our shows.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.800]   - Hi, I'm Heather Gold and my favorite tech story
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.520]   the last decade is the democratization of media.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.240]   We've gone from creating streaming in the mid 90s
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.040]   all the way to everybody having their own smartphone
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.200]   that they, well everybody,
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.840]   but being able to broadcast from a phone to Leo
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.400]   having his own studio in a cottage, which is fantastic.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.680]   And I'm looking forward to broadcasting myself
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.080]   and a world where we get media from everywhere
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.360]   and hopefully in another 10 years,
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.480]   the mainstream media looks very different
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.000]   and we'll have more democratic change
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.320]   in around and many other places in part
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.040]   because we've had access to media everywhere.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.920]   - Yeah, I think that's really true.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.640]   That's one of the things I talked about
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.600]   when I went to Dubai to do the TEDx Dubai
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.280]   is the fact that the mainstream media
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.000]   no longer controls everything means
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.160]   that you get to tell your own story.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.880]   In fact, I encouraged the,
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.120]   particularly people from the Arab world
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.440]   who are listening to my talk.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.920]   Here's your chance to tell your story
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.640]   in a way that's disintermediated
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.880]   that American media has a very strong point of view about Arabs.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.960]   You wanna affect that?
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.400]   Here's your chance.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.160]   - Well, now that this year we saw the rise of HD video
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.960]   on YouTube, you can use a camera like this one
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.840]   which is still a fairly expensive camera
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.560]   but affordable to a fairly wide range of society.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.920]   - Minnow HD or the ZIA is good enough.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.280]   That's what you use, isn't it, a lot of the time?
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.640]   - I'm using more of the 5D
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.320]   because there is a difference in quality
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.400]   and also I can zoom in and--
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.080]   - It's the lenses, yeah.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.600]   It's funny, all three of us have Canon 5D Mark IIs
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.840]   and somebody actually said
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.680]   that that was one of the big stories.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.800]   If you begin the decade, I looked back in 1999.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.720]   - Yeah.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:01.120]   - The big digital camera breakthrough was three megapixels.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.480]   It was, remember this, the Nikon CoolPix 950?
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.720]   It was the one that had the twist, the two parts.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.680]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, the twist side, yeah.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.280]   - It was three megapixels
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.520]   and that was a huge breakthrough.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.760]   We began the decade with that
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.160]   and now you'd look back on that and say,
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.600]   "Whoa."
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   And what is Nikon's got the D3, the D70, the D90?
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:28.040]   Canon's got the 5D, the 70, I mean, revolutionary.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:33.040]   - I remember I was actually, well, later '90s, '96.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.320]   I was working at 97, maybe I was working at Best Buy
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.200]   and I was doing all the computer fixing and repair in the back
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.640]   and we'd have people returning digital cameras
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.840]   because the battery life on them, first of all,
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.040]   it was non-rechargeable batteries.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.440]   You had to slide in the double A's, right?
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.840]   So you had to put in like four double A's.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.320]   They were all VGA cameras.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.560]   So like the resolution was like 640 by 480 or something like that
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.360]   and you would get with a little tiny LCD,
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.720]   you would get probably, I mean, this is like
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.520]   postage stamp size LCD.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.880]   You'd probably get maybe two hours of usage
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.280]   or you'd have to put a four new, brand new double A's in it.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.200]   It was just ridiculous.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.000]   - Remember the Sony Mavica that recorded on a floppy?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.600]   I had an Apple- - A quick take.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.560]   - A quick take was a VGA camera, right?
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.680]   Or maybe even half VGA, it was 320.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.280]   - A 3.5 floppy, it was gracemail.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.080]   - You'd record it on a little floppy on the Mavica.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.960]   And I remember we, it was during tech TV
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.480]   because people would come to our events
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.680]   and take pictures of these
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.520]   and it would take forever to save the...
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   - All right, all right, all right.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.840]   - And the floppy.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.720]   Oh Lord, and of course you couldn't even get
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.680]   a quarter of an image on a floppy now.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.560]   I mean 1.4 megabytes, no.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.720]   - Well then later on recording to the CD, right?
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.560]   - Yes. - They started doing that
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.120]   with the video cameras.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.080]   - Right. - Or the camcorders.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.920]   - We're gonna continue.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.600]   - Yesterday I did an interview,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.080]   took 13 gigabytes on my 5D.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.840]   - And it was probably 10 minutes, right?
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.200]   - No, 40 minutes.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.040]   - Yeah.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.920]   - You know, HD video.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.960]   - Takes up some space.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.560]   We're gonna, and how big is a card in there?
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.080]   - 16 gig card. - 32.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.360]   - 32 gig card.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.280]   - 32.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.920]   - Robert, does it stop every 12 minutes or no?
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.080]   - Every 14 minutes. - Yeah,
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.080]   because it's that file system.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.000]   - So two gigs is the max.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.640]   - Four gig, four gigs is the max.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.880]   - Her file, yeah.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   - And so you can only store 14 minutes.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.840]   I think that's a good discipline.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.440]   - I don't think that's a bad thing.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.360]   That's a good discipline.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.200]   You shouldn't be shooting more than...
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.640]   - You shouldn't shoot more than five seconds at a time.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.920]   Why the go see a movie?
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.440]   - You ever sit on a shot for 14 minutes?
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.640]   I don't even sit on a shot for 14 minutes.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.560]   - You should talk Leo.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.320]   We're watching this for an hour every Sunday.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.680]   - Yeah, but I switch, I switch.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.320]   It's always moving, it's always moving.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.720]   Look at that, look at that.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.200]   Hey, speaking of switching, let's take a little break.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.040]   We're gonna come back.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.760]   Kevin Rose from Dig is our guest,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.360]   Robert Scobel from Scobelizer and Building43.com.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.640]   We're talking, and you, we have a lot of videos
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.720]   from all of our viewers and many of our Twitch hosts
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.840]   talking about the decade past.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.080]   This is our year ender, our decade ender.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.240]   I do wanna talk about squarespace.com.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.520]   Talk about a revolution in making websites.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.600]   That's something that's completely transformed
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.400]   over the last few years.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.720]   The ability to make good looking,
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.920]   simple, easy websites that can handle huge traffic.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.320]   It's remarkable, Squarespace the leader here.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.840]   These guys started this in college just a few years ago,
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.040]   and now they're the absolute leaders.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   I know Kevin uses Squarespace for his website.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   They're the absolute leaders in easy websites.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.960]   Hosting plus the software, beautiful designs, drag and drop,
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.200]   allows you to very easily create a site
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.880]   that looks good and then modify it very easily.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.920]   They also make it very easy to import your data and export it.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.000]   If it's not a roach motel, you're not trapped at Squarespace.

[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.200]   The import from WordPress, TypePad, Blogger.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.080]   Couldn't be easier, the export right back out.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.800]   Beautiful photo galleries and more.

[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.400]   that they're doing, the examples are just remarkable.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.040]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.280]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.880]   Let's do another video.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.960]   We've got videos from many of the Twit hosts.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.480]   This would be kind of a fun one
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.680]   since we were talking about cameras.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.760]   Chris Marquard is the host of the tips
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.040]   from the top floor podcast
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.360]   and appears regularly on my tech guy radio show
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.040]   and he has something to say about photography.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.160]   - Hey Leo, hi everyone else out there.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.640]   This is Chris Marquard of tips from the top floor
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.000]   and the by far most important development for me personally
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.600]   and for a lot of other people in the photography
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.840]   and video field is the inclusion of cinema quality
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.400]   video functions in pretty regular DSLRs.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.800]   Not only do they go up to very high ISO's these days,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.920]   they also include video quality
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.560]   that you wouldn't have thought possible
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.520]   from devices like this a year ago.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.800]   So things have really changed big time
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.320]   and this is gonna change the landscape for many people.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.800]   It has started to do that for me and that'll continue.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.600]   So that's it from me, happy new year.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.040]   - I think we're all in agreement on that one,
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.600]   Robert Shaw is at 5D.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.800]   What is that lens you have on there?
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.840]   Is that a wide angle lens?
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.360]   - Yeah, it's a 17 to 40 millimeter.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.720]   - Same here.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.040]   - F 4.0.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.800]   I looked at the 2.8 but the 4 is half the price
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.960]   and lighter to carry and the 4 actually gives you
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.320]   more depth of field which really helps you on video
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.840]   because unfortunately--
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.000]   - It's hard to keep it in focus, I agree, yeah.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.960]   - Yeah, the small monitors don't let you focus
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.880]   really well in video so you really have to work at it
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.720]   and having more depth of field really helps you.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   - Yeah, I actually got the 2.8 but--
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.880]   - That's 'cause you're rich.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.000]   - That's 'cause I got more money than Kevin.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.520]   - Kevin, actually you must be doing all right
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.000]   because I'm seeing your name more and more
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.200]   on angel investing.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.720]   You just put some money into Gowala, right?
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.640]   - I did, yes.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.560]   - I like Gowala. - Gowala.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.040]   - Really cool.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.240]   - You know, I'm bullish on the social kind of location
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.720]   savings space, of course where Gowala,
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.400]   all these guys looped, there's a bunch of them
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.840]   that are getting into the game.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.520]   I think that really if you take a look at what we're doing,
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.520]   how we're bookmarking places that we visit,
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.960]   places that we care about, I mean, when I have kids
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.840]   and Leo, you're using this, when your kids get older
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.000]   and they wanna start looking back,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.320]   where was Dad on this day?
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.600]   You'll be able to jump back into time
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.880]   and see exactly where you were, your favorite hangouts.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.320]   I think it's awesome.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.440]   - That's interesting, I never thought of it.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.480]   - So you're saying that there's Gowala right there.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.040]   - You can see that number 10 right there?
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.880]   - Yeah.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.400]   - That's the number of unique places that Scoble has been to.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.240]   So that means he's actually been to 10 places
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.080]   that he's checked out.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.400]   You might have checked into several of those places
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.000]   multiple times, but mine's at about 90.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.480]   So I-- - Whoa!
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.760]   - It encourages you to go out there and try new stuff.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.040]   I find myself like someone saying,
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   "Hey, do you wanna go try this?"
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.640]   And I'm like, "No, let's just go to the place
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.120]   "I normally like to go to."
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.120]   But then I'm like, "No, I'm gonna get an extra badge.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.880]   "I'll get an extra little number going up.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.960]   "I wanna go check this out, I might as well."
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.240]   And then you go there and you see who else is there.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.120]   The thing I think is really cool about these applications
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.760]   is that you can see who's there
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.480]   before you even walk in the door.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.320]   It's nuts.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.120]   You can go to a bar in San Francisco,
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.360]   and I know it's not like this everywhere,
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   but San Francisco being a very tech-centric city.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.680]   You can go to a bar, choose the bar,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.200]   choose the people in the bar,
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.640]   and it'll show you how many people of your friends
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.880]   or just anyone have checked into that place
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.520]   in the last few hours.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.840]   So I can actually see who's in there before I walk in.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.480]   - I only have 90 badges. - I only have 90 badges.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.400]   You have 90 badges?
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.880]   - Yeah, but you're not, you gotta start checking in my case.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.240]   - Well, I just started using Go Walla.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.920]   Now, we talked to Dennis from Four Square
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.000]   on Net at Night last week.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.280]   You know, this is tough to choose
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.520]   from both of these programs.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.040]   I've been using Go Walla 'cause of you, Kevin,
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.040]   'cause I wanna support you, but both of these--
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.680]   - I'm an investor in both, so--
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.520]   - Oh, you are?
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.360]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.080]   Oh, you're hedging your bets then?
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.840]   - I just, you know, I, Go Walla came a little bit later
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.000]   down the road, and those guys approached me.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.960]   And I went out to dinner with Josh,
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.640]   and he's such an amazing guy.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.480]   And yeah, I mean, I really like what they're,
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   they're kind of going in different directions in my mind.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.000]   - Are they, 'cause they both seem like they're using
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.080]   kind of gaming to make it more fun?
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.840]   - Yeah, but the difference is that Go Walla
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.880]   is doing a lot more kind of item-based stuff.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.560]   So as you collect different virtual items,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.640]   you can see whose hands are passing through.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.880]   They also did this contest thing,
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.200]   where if you check in to certain places,
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.040]   they were hiding real items, like gifts in those cases.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:58.880]   - Well, that's cool.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.800]   Yeah, 'cause I've been dropping items,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.440]   but I didn't know there were real items too.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.280]   That's cool.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.480]   - Yeah, there's real items, yeah,
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.400]   and they hide around.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.200]   You can like, somebody found an iPod
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.800]   underneath the Christmas tree
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.840]   in the center of San Francisco.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.760]   - Wow. - And they picked it up,
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.600]   and then you put in your name--
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.040]   - That's smart. - And they send it out to you.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.840]   - That's smart.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.600]   Now, it's-- - It's gonna be really cool.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.720]   - Both of these work better, though,
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.840]   if you're in a metro area,
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.080]   if you're a hipster, urban hipster,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.960]   like you and Robert.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.720]   - Yeah. - Yeah, 'cause Petaluma--
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.440]   - It's getting better, though.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.240]   Four squared, I use four squared.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.400]   - Look at all the badges you have.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.400]   I hardly have any badges in my four squared,
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.880]   it's just a few.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.600]   I've got newbie, adventurer, explorer, local, super user,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.680]   and gym rat, I'm proud to say.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.920]   - Do you have the player please badge?
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.760]   Have you seen that award?
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.880]   - Playa, please.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.640]   Is that if you go to too many bars?
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.600]   - No, no, no, it's if you check into a location
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.800]   with three members of the opposite sex.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.640]   - Oh!
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.160]   - So clearly, Leo, you haven't checked
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.560]   into any place for the player.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.400]   - Oh, player, please.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.960]   And there's one that says, "crunk, how do I get that one?"
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.560]   - I think you just have to go get hammered.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.400]   (laughing)
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.160]   - Four bars, four bars and one night,
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.200]   you get the crunk's badge.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.400]   - I think that's how you get that one.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.080]   The really interesting thing,
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.520]   I mean, the game is sort of fun,
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.120]   but it gets boring after a while on both of these.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.600]   The really interesting thing is when you check in,
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.840]   other people can leave you tips for near
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.720]   where you just checked in.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.440]   So here's all the tips for the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.960]   And there's done-- - I love that.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.800]   - Of tips for what to do near you.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   This was invaluable when I got to Paris,
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.480]   because I checked in at the airport
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.000]   and it tells you all sorts of stuff about what to do
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.760]   both in the airport and around you.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.080]   And then when we checked into our house,
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.600]   somebody left, "Hey, the best Paris bakery
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.240]   is right around the corner."
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.480]   And that really makes your experience a lot different.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.320]   It's a lot different than anything like Yelp,
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.240]   where you know what you're searching for.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.080]   - Right.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:47.920]   - What they're gonna do though,
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.920]   this is really where they're gonna monetize this,
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   because if you think about it,
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.600]   you'll check in at a bar and they'll say,
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.360]   "Hey, by the way, the bar across the street
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.200]   has a free drink if you show them this on your phone."
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.040]   - Or if you're the mayor of a bar, you get free drinks
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.600]   and then everybody competes to become the mayor of a bar.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.720]   I think that's what Four Squares doing that I think is smart.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.640]   Well, you're smart, you've invested in both of them.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.880]   What else are you invested in?
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.640]   What else do you, I mean, this is the best way to say,
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.000]   to ask what you think the future is,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.280]   is where you put your money.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.120]   What else do you like?
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.320]   - I have to pull up my crunch base.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.120]   There's been a few lately.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.680]   There's probably a lot of the ones that you already know.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.520]   - I'm sorry.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.520]   - I just noticed every once in a while,
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.840]   I said, "Kevin Rose, put some money in it."
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.480]   I think that probably your name is as much valuable
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.320]   as anything else.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.400]   I know you help pounce quite a bit
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.760]   when you invest it in pounds.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.680]   - Yeah, so "Daily Booth" is another woman
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.520]   that's kind of exploding,
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.600]   but that's a little bit younger generation kind of stuff.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.040]   - What is that, video?
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.680]   - It's like a picture of the day.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.560]   It's kind of like YouTube, but just for pictures.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.440]   So you can go in and basically just take a picture
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.320]   every single day, but it's really super social
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.120]   and they throw the photos right in front of everybody else.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.560]   You can see kind of in real time
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.760]   with everyone else to take pictures
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.960]   from all over the world.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   It's pretty cool.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.720]   And some of the ones you know, like in "Gmoco"
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.120]   they make a bunch of different iPhone games out there,
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.900]   touchpets, a bunch of different stuff, Twitter.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.160]   Let's see here.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.880]   "Daily Booth" is very interesting, your life in Paris.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.840]   - Simple geo, which is kind of an S3 for geo location.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.680]   That's not a product.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.440]   - You like location.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.280]   - I do like location.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   I think it's a nice big thing for us.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.400]   - You know, clearly what's important to all of these
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.320]   is you have an app.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.440]   You gotta have an app.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.400]   You have to have an iPhone app or a phone app
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.080]   or maybe increasingly have a Droid app.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.560]   Kim Landware had something to say about that
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.920]   in Kim's post for us.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.120]   Kim used Vimeo to post.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:45.520]   - Okay, for the technology of the decade,
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.640]   I'm gonna choose this little thing
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.760]   along with the apps that are on it
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.520]   and the app store.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.280]   With this, I can do almost anything on the go
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.880]   that I can do at home or at work
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.440]   as far as an office is concerned.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.760]   I can read my email.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:12.280]   I can take pictures.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.320]   - This is an ongoing revolution, isn't it?
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.360]   This, I mean, the idea that you can take this with you
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.240]   and be always connected,
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.280]   you couldn't have any of those location-based services
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.120]   without it.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.880]   - I honestly believe that this is the biggest story
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.280]   of the decade of that.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.160]   The fact that mobile has finally arrived.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   I mean, for the last 10 years, five years,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.840]   we've been talking about the coming of mobile
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.920]   and next generation websites on mobile.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.840]   And it's clear now with the iPhone
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.280]   and now with Android and the Palm Free,
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.560]   it's like we're here.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.400]   Everyone's using it.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.360]   When my mom comes to me and says,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.360]   "Check out this new app that I just installed."
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.400]   I know, I know before I--
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.920]   - It's here, it really is, isn't it?
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.480]   Yeah, yeah, that's really true.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.120]   Martin Sargent had another point of view
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.760]   about the value of the web,
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.260]   maybe something a little bit unexpected.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:02.520]   - Clearly, the biggest tech story of the decade
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.120]   is the fact that thanks to internet,
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.080]   grocery stores no longer exist.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.120]   With web van and pee pod,
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.840]   we now do all our grocery shopping
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.920]   from the computers in our refrigerators.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.240]   Get them delivered, Crispin Fresh by courteous robots.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.680]   The only thing I miss?
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.920]   Not being able to read about my rich and beautiful TV friends
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.200]   in Star Magazine while standing in line.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.640]   Bye, Leo and the gang.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.680]   - Thank you, Marty.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.520]   - Martin Sargent, the host of This Week in Fun.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.240]   And, well, he's absolutely right.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   I mean, look at web van, wait a minute.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.640]   Not to mention buying kitty litter on pets.com by mail.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   - I will say though, I think it's kind of coming back
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.960]   in a way, I'm using the Amazon Prime.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.800]   Have you guys used that?
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.640]   - Yeah, I love it.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.200]   - The free two-day shipping.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.040]   It's awesome.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.080]   - But even better than Prime,
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.280]   I've been a Prime member for a long time.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.440]   What about subscribe?
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.200]   Do you know about Amazon subscribe?
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.440]   - Oh, what's this?
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.960]   - Oh, this is the best thing.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.600]   So you can subscribe to toilet paper or whatever,
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.280]   raise your blades, anything you buy in a regular basis
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.040]   called subscribe and save and you get 15% off
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.200]   because you're an automatic subscription customer
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.680]   and it just comes every month, two months,
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   three months, however often you need it.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.040]   I wish they had more products on there,
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.200]   but it's kind of the grocery,
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.720]   the same idea, the grocery shopping thing automatically.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.280]   - I honestly order my toilet paper
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.880]   and my paper towel is over Amazon.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.720]   - Yeah.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.760]   - Probably, you might know the best for the environment.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.880]   I think it is kind of, right?
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.800]   - Well, the trucks are going around anyway, come on.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.600]   - They're going around anyway.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.480]   Somebody's got to deliver somehow.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.160]   You know, I have to, in all seriousness,
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.280]   Amazon is clearly one of the big stories of the decade.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.480]   I mean, you start the decade with the tech bust, right?
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.080]   The stock market tanking all of these companies
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.880]   like pets.com, web band and people
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.600]   going out of business.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.640]   Amazon, the one merchant just kind of struggling to hold on.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.920]   Even at the time, I think we said,
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.360]   if any company can survive, once we come out of this,
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.440]   they're going to be in a good position.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.480]   Amazon not only survived, they were smart,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.320]   they took all their money and invested it
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.360]   in distribution centers all over the country.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.240]   At the time, I remember people thought they're nuts.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   What are they doing?
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.200]   Boy, nuts like a Fox, Jeff Bezos clearly knew
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.000]   what he was doing now.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.600]   Amazon can affordably deliver you stuff
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.520]   from local distribution centers.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.800]   And you know, people like you and me, Kevin,
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.760]   maybe aren't mainstream yet,
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   but I think we're the kind of precursors of the future.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.600]   This is where I buy everything.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.360]   - Well, you've seen their stock has jumped what 70%
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.480]   in the last six months.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.440]   It's been insane.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.360]   - Yeah, it's become obvious.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.640]   - It just feels as though, I mean,
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.360]   when the economy was kind of taking a dump,
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.240]   I was thinking like, now's a good time to buy Amazon
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.640]   because everyone was going online.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.120]   You save a little bit extra, you don't have to pay sales tax
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   and you get that with prime and get that two day shipping.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.960]   It just made sense.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.320]   And it looks like everybody else was doing the same thing.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.640]   - You feel that way too, Robert?
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.840]   - I mean, you have a little baby.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.320]   Yeah, there's his gift card.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.160]   Was that your Christmas present?
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.840]   - That was my Christmas present from my brother.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.840]   - Yeah, that's a perfect present.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.680]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.600]   - Sure, Alex knows where you spend your money.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.600]   - And I'm not gonna share the back with the coat on it.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.960]   (laughing)
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.840]   - No, and prime is really, prime again,
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.280]   brilliant marketing, right?
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.360]   Because you pay them 75 bucks
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.440]   for the privilege of free two night shipping.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:21.800]   What's the upshot of that?
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.440]   The first place you go is Amazon
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.640]   'cause you know you're gonna get in two days.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.760]   You've paid them for stickiness.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.320]   - Well, no, I talk about using everything that they have
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.160]   at their disposal.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.720]   They've taken their extra servers that they have
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.360]   that they know are idle at certain times
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.600]   and turn it to a resource
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.320]   that other developers can tie into.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.720]   - EC2 and S3.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.080]   - You kind of shocked when they did that.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.040]   Initially, I was like, wait a second, they sell stuff.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:43.880]   Why are they doing this?
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.320]   But now it makes sense.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.000]   It reminds me of watching National Geographic
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.640]   where you see those tribes that use every little piece
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.640]   of the animal. - The cargo cults.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.520]   (both laughing)
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.520]   - Amazon is, right?
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.080]   - You know, there's a precedent for it
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.720]   'cause you might be too young to remember,
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.120]   but H&R Block had a lot of excess computer power
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.200]   during the evenings.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.480]   They would use these big mainframe computers
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.560]   to do tax returns all day.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.200]   And somebody bright, some bright fellow H&R Block said,
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.240]   you know, we could use these mainframes
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.320]   for some sort of public time sharing service
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.920]   and CompuServe was born.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.000]   CompuServe was an H&R Block service
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:19.960]   and it makes perfect sense.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.120]   If you've got excess capacity, sell it off
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:22.960]   to people who will buy.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.360]   And that's exactly what Amazon's done.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.040]   I use S3 like crazy.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.520]   - Yeah, the cloud computing is one of the biggest stories
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   of the decade.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.360]   And a lot of people, it's not a sexy story
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:36.040]   because people don't, you know, they don't buy stuff,
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.240]   you know, like with a gift card.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   But it's revolutionized how business has been built
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   and at Rackspace where I work,
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.080]   we've seen in the last six months, tens of thousands
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.400]   of customers join the cloud.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   And it's amazing what people are doing with it.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.040]   - Well, I think-- - And we're number two.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.360]   So if we're doing tens of thousands of new customers
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.480]   every six months, imagine what Amazon's doing.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.320]   - Not to mention Google, of course,
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.880]   'cause you know, the Google App Engine,
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.480]   you were talking about that, Kevin.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.640]   - Google is less interesting to most businesses
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.480]   than Amazon or a hosting company like Rackspace
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.800]   because they force you to be into their system.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.480]   You have to build-- - You have to use their docs
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.800]   and their-- - And if you're building
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.920]   a dig of the future, that means you can't sell
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.040]   a Microsoft. (laughs)
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.800]   - So-- - But here's a statistic
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.440]   I got from our show this week in Google,
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.120]   60% of state governments use Google Docs.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.120]   And I bet you it's a similar number in business.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.760]   Don't you think Google Docs is a perfect example
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.680]   of a successful cloud computing initiative?
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.400]   - Absolutely, LA just standardized
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.360]   and beat out Rackspace, by the way,
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.960]   on standardizing on Google Docs.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.680]   So congrats to them.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.240]   - Pretty dramatic. - Yeah.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.960]   - Yeah. - We're gonna take a break.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.400]   - You know, before we do, I wanna mention Steve Wozniak.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.600]   He said he wasn't feeling well enough to send us a video,
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.640]   but Woz said, and boy, this is a good point.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.960]   I almost forgot the big story of the decade,
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.560]   the Mars Rover landing and the discovery of water on Mars.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.240]   We forget, but that's huge.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.720]   - That's huge. - I mean, I hope that that's
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.600]   the beginning of exploration of Mars,
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.360]   manned flights to Mars, that would be--
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.440]   - I talked with a scientist at NASA
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.880]   and he said discovering water on the moon
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.440]   was also important for that mission,
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.680]   because the moon is gonna be a halfway point,
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.120]   or not really a halfway point, but a stopping,
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.520]   a stopover point for astronauts
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.480]   or for devices that wanna go on to Mars.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.280]   - So unless you have to take with you,
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.360]   you know, up that gravity well from Earth,
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.800]   the better off you are.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.640]   - Yeah.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.080]   - So who's going on Virgin Galactic?
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.880]   - I'd be there if I had the money.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.480]   What is it, 20 million?
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.960]   - I think it's 200K, right?
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.800]   - Oh, is that all?
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.640]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.720]   (laughing)
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.120]   - When you were in Clinton, you could do that?
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.400]   - You could be a sponsor for that.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.640]   - I would love to go, you know, I'm too old
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.840]   and my eye's that's too terrible and I'm way too fat,
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.200]   but I would love to go into space.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.800]   That would be, even if they said, okay,
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.120]   you can go on a Mars mission,
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.600]   but we can't afford to bring you back.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.040]   It's a one-way trip.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.880]   - You wouldn't go.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.320]   - I'd volunteer. - No, family.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.280]   - Oh, well, this'll be a few years.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.780]   Believe me, my kids don't care about me.
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.360]   At this point, I could go and say,
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.240]   "Dad, we'll see."
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.840]   But, you know, I'd get a call from Abby saying,
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.960]   "Hey, can you give me a ride?"
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.720]   And I said, "No, I'm on Mars, honey."
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.440]   She called, she used to call me in Canada.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.280]   I need to ride home.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.880]   I said, "I'm in Canada."
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.920]   - Is she old enough to drive here?
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.760]   She's getting paid, right?
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.440]   - She is. This was a while. Oh, she drives, believe me.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.280]   She's in France. - She's in France.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.640]   - She's in Paris right now.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.840]   Hey, when she does drive though,
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.200]   and I know Henry wants to do this too,
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.080]   they really want to drive my new Ford
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.200]   because of that great Ford Sync.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.120]   - Smooth, huh?
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.720]   - Let me tell you, this is,
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.520]   I know you guys are probably mocking me.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.000]   I'm sure that Kevin, you drive a Maserati.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.720]   And I know-- - And I know,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.560]   many. - And I know Robert,
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.080]   you drive a Prius.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.080]   But let me tell you something.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.200]   If you ever get a chance to take a ride
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.720]   and afford Lincoln or Mercury vehicle,
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.840]   actually, if you're going to CES,
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.040]   come see it, we're going to be driving the Lincoln.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.080]   I think the MKS.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.440]   And take a look at the Ford Sync.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.160]   This is amazing.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.880]   There's some big announcements coming from Ford at CES,
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.040]   including, I guess, Wi-Fi.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.880]   Not what you would think, not like Wi-Fi,
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.720]   so the car syncs with your home network.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.040]   No, Wi-Fi in the car so that you can compute
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.080]   while you're driving around.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.600]   Now, I don't know if that's a fact,
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.680]   I've just read all the rumors about that on a gadget,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.000]   but I do know that the Ford Sync,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.880]   the way I have it, the amazing hands-free calling,
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.520]   music search, turn by turn GPS built in.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.920]   You never take your eyes off the road,
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.840]   your hands off the wheel,
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.320]   you just press a button on the steering wheel
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.400]   and it tells you where to go.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.440]   It tells you what traffic is,
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.680]   weather conditions, ski conditions, sports scores.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.400]   Even your fantasy football league,
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.120]   it'll tell you how you're doing in there.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.800]   You can ask for songs by name, ask for podcasts.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.280]   It's incredible.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.520]   - There is one thing about the Sync
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.600]   that I think is really cool that I really like.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.200]   It's the Pandora streaming, right?
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.280]   - Yeah. - You don't know that yet?
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.480]   - Yeah, I mean, does it do Pandora streaming?
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.080]   - They just announced it recently.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.760]   I saw that Pandora streaming through the phone sync.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.240]   - Now, the neat thing about Sync, it has USB.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.160]   So you can upgrade it, you go to SyncMyRide.com
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.920]   and you download the latest software you plug in.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.640]   And of course, you can plug in via USB,
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.400]   your iPhone or iPod, it charges.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.080]   And the Sync reads what's on it and plays it back.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.280]   By name, you can, Droid, it works with the Droid,
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.640]   it works with my N900.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.840]   Almost anything that you've got.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.280]   If you've got a USB connection, sync and read it and use it.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.160]   You gotta check it out.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.720]   Go to SyncMyRidepodcast.com to learn more.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.800]   Or, best thing, go to your local Ford,
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.160]   Lincoln or Mercury dealer, say,
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.060]   I wanna test drive, Ford Sync.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.880]   - Actually, Leo, one of the coolest things
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.120]   that came out in cars is the use of radar.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.720]   And I know the Ford--
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.120]   - Flex parks itself.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.640]   - Ford, Taurus, it's not just about parking itself.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.040]   The Ford Taurus, the 2010 Ford Taurus,
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.760]   if people stop ahead of you really fast,
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.880]   it warns you that you're about to get in an accident
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.240]   and actually pretensions the brakes.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.080]   - Yes.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.560]   - Well, your pre-est does that too, doesn't it?
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.800]   - It does, it's, and I think that,
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   that, you know, if you were gonna make something safer,
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.280]   the car industry, I think they should be forced
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.880]   to put radar in every single car.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.320]   - Well, you know what this is all about?
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.320]   We have the technology to do autonomous vehicles.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.760]   We're very close to being able to,
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.000]   it's been demonstrated, have a car that drives you
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.040]   where you wanna go, completely safely avoiding traffic
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.960]   at high speeds.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.520]   I think that the car companies know that
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.200]   this terrifies people.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.040]   - Yeah.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.920]   - So what they do, you know, they put this technology,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.040]   the bliss technology that came from Volvo,
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.720]   it's in the SHO, where it tells you
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.200]   if there's people in your blind spot,
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.640]   the flex parks itself.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.120]   - This is all to get us used to it.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.960]   Just, you know, trust the car, let the car do the work.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.920]   - No, it's true when I interviewed Ford's engineers,
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.360]   they said that they actually have more technology
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.640]   that they can't put in the cars
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.480]   because they do customer research.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.440]   And most of the customers are freaked out about it.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.760]   - I think, I think, when we do this show in 10 years,
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.560]   that's one of the things we'll talk about.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.200]   And by the way, and I've talked to a couple of people,
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.160]   Templeton.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.240]   - Brad Templeton.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.600]   - Brad Templeton, who's this chairman of the EFF,
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.800]   but also among many, he's like a polymath,
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.120]   among many things he's interested in,
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.080]   his autonomous vehicles.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.000]   He has some really interesting things to say
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:23.920]   about this whole notion.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.600]   And one of his ideas is this is a huge energy saver.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.200]   If we could get people used to the idea,
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.560]   not of owning their own vehicle,
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.440]   but calling for an electric vehicle when they need it.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.960]   So it just shows up in your door,
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.880]   you get in, it takes you to where you want.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:43.120]   Kind of like those city car rental things.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.040]   But it drives-- - Zipcar.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.320]   - Zipcar, but it drives to you.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.240]   He says, huge savings in power and stuff.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.320]   He said, the problem is, of course, we know Americans
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.240]   and what they're gonna end up doing
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.800]   is getting bigger and bigger cars pretty soon.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.040]   You'll be an RV that comes to you,
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.520]   and you're living room on wheels. (laughs)
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.760]   And it's not gonna have any energy efficiency at all.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.400]   He says, what you really could do though,
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.760]   is if you're gonna go on a vacation,
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   you could say, okay, and when I wanna get a little car
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   drive there, when I get there,
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.560]   I want that living room to be there waiting for me.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:16.800]   Brian Brushwood, who hosts our great NSFW show,
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.720]   he's also in scam school on revision three,
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.080]   great magician talent, funny guy,
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:25.160]   has something to say about the decade.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.400]   - Howdy guys, Brian Brushwood from NSFW
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.400]   and scam school, and I wanna take you back 10 years ago
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.440]   to this exact day one decade ago
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.320]   when we all sat at home with our shotguns in hand,
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.440]   convinced it was the end of the world
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.920]   because of Y2K.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.600]   How great was that idea that at midnight,
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.200]   as the time zones rolled closer,
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.280]   more and more chaos would come our way?
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.240]   Businesses spent $500 billion,
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.480]   and it turns out that the ones who did stuff about it
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.200]   did just as well as those that didn't do a dang thing.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.960]   Y2K, my favorite story from the last 10 years to the moment.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.400]   - I think I have to agree with him.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   Thank you, Brian Brushwood.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.000]   That was the story that began the decade.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.800]   - Yeah, I bought a few extra jugs of water.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.640]   - Did you?
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.560]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.520]   - You weren't a tech TV yet when that happened.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.520]   - No, no.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.880]   - I remember Patrick and I were on call.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:20.360]   They said, we don't know if there's gonna be a big story.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:23.680]   We're gonna let you go home, but you have to be on call.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.840]   So if anything breaks, you can rush back to tech TV
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.280]   and we can cover it wall to wall.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.520]   And I remember boy, that was nothing.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.680]   It was ridiculous.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:37.280]   I think another big, big story,
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.560]   I'm gonna go to Max Future,
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.280]   because this is, I think, another big story.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.600]   And we've kind of touched on it a little bit for the decade.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:49.680]   - The tech story of the decade is Apple Computers,
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.680]   which came for being a has-been run as a computer company
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.480]   at the beginning of the decade
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.080]   with a really small market share
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.280]   compared to what it is today.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.800]   To now being a company bigger in market cap
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:08.960]   than HP or Dell combined.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:12.640]   And phenomenally changing two areas of technology.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.360]   One is music with the domination of the iTunes store
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.720]   and the iPod in terms of market share from digital music
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.080]   and also dominating smartphones
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:29.240]   with the innovation of the iPhone and the app store
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.680]   and just the phenomenal success.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.440]   So that's why it's the tech story of the decade.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.920]   - Yeah, let's not forget, thanks Max Future,
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.960]   let's not forget that the decade began,
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.800]   2001 was when the iPod came out.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.920]   So Apple began the decade with the iPod.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.840]   In some ways, now I pose it to you guys.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.680]   It's not merely the success of Apple,
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.920]   it's the withering of Microsoft, wouldn't you say?
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.960]   You worked at Microsoft, what do you think, Robert?
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   - I don't know that Microsoft has withered all that much,
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.080]   it's just not been all that interesting.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.680]   They still have $14 billion businesses there
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:08.560]   and still have quite a bit of market share on desktops.
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.600]   I mean, Windows 7 is selling like hotcakes.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   So I think Apple has seen opportunities
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.800]   before anybody else and has done a better job
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.640]   than the rest of the industry.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.520]   - This is where Steve Jobs really excels.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.120]   I mean, he may not inventing the products necessarily.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.320]   Personal computer was around before the Apple II,
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.920]   the MP3 player was around before the iPod,
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.600]   smart phones were around before the iPhone,
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.680]   but he and all three cases created a product, productized it.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.800]   He popularized it, he made it a success.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.160]   And I think the same thing might be said about the tablet.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.680]   I mean, if all these rumors are true.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.200]   - Not before the iPod, there was what?
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   The Diamond Rio?
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.520]   - Oh yeah, I mean, I had a Diamond Rio.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.000]   I remember Patrick and I like doing big stories
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.720]   about how to take a PC and put it in your car
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.600]   so you could listen to music in your car.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.920]   It was a whole computer, you know?
[00:59:58.920 --> 00:59:59.760]   Crazy.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.880]   And then somebody did a hard drive based,
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.680]   it was the PBG player, the PBJ player,
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.400]   something like that, Patrick would remember,
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.920]   hard drive based thing and it was huge
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.840]   and it was very clunky, very hard to use,
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.560]   the user interface was terrible.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.560]   Like six months later, Apple does the iPod
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.440]   and like everything else just dies and Apple owns it,
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.280]   almost instantly Apple owns it.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.120]   - Yeah.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.040]   - Don McAllister, who's our host
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.200]   from a Mac break weekly frequently and also of course--
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.200]   - I think it's Don McAllister.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.160]   - Hold on Don, I'm introducing you.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.840]   He also is from the ScreenCasts online podcast.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.600]   He's really, I'm gonna give him credit
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.840]   for having invented and successfully capitalized
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.080]   on subscription podcasts with ScreenCasts online.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:40.920]   - Go ahead Don.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.160]   - ScreenCasts online.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.520]   My own personal take on my favorite technology
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.240]   for the past decade.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.920]   Now it really is a personal take
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.400]   and I make no excuses for that,
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.320]   but it's a technology that's really changed my life
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.240]   and many other people's lives in the way that it enabled us
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:59.280]   to produce and distribute digital content online.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.520]   And that's real simple syndication or RSS.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.440]   Now RSS was actually developed back in 1999,
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.880]   but it was only in the 2000s.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.960]   In fact, it wasn't a year 2000
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.480]   that Dave Weiner published the RSS spec
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.760]   that included enclosures.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760]   - Wow, that's really--
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.960]   - It's really an easy way of referencing external media
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.240]   within an RSS feed.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.320]   And that's when things really start to take off.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.080]   It really bootstrapped the whole podcasting industry
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.440]   at that time.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.960]   Now the next big thing really was Apple's adoption
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.960]   of RSS and podcasting in iTunes and overnight.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.920]   I think it was 2005.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.200]   Podcasting really became mainstream
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.720]   and iTunes became the de facto client for podcasting.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.840]   Now a double-edged sword really
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.040]   in that it did actually kill lots of the third party,
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.280]   in fact all of the third party podcasting clients
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.520]   at that point, but it did bring podcasting
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.320]   to the mainstream and really we've not looked back since.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.400]   So that's it RSS, as I say,
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.520]   a hugely enabling technology that not just for podcasting
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.480]   but for lots of the social media platforms
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.440]   and all other distribution content delivery mechanisms.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.160]   It's really been an integral part and a huge enabler
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.640]   to change the face of broadcasting as we know it.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.520]   - Thank you, Don.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.520]   And by the way, there's my diamond Rio.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.680]   - Nice.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.480]   - I actually have one somewhere, I gotta find it.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.840]   This is just a picture.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.880]   So what do you think, RSS?
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.640]   I know Robert, you're a RSS fan, right?
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.480]   - Big one, I named my--
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.720]   - But still you kid.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.280]   You named your kid RSS?
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.640]   - Yep.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.560]   - Not just for-- - Should I go get him?
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.640]   Like I can go downstairs and get--
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.800]   - Did you intentionally, I mean,
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.280]   I know you named him-- - A three-year-old baby
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.840]   is Ryan Sarush Skubble.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.040]   - But did you intentionally pick those initials?
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.320]   - Yeah, Dave Weiner's one of my best friends.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.400]   So I did that. - Interesting.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.920]   - That's very cool.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.560]   - Pay him some homage.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.160]   - I thought that was just a happy coincidence.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.200]   I didn't realize you did that on purpose.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.800]   - I mean, I'm a huge fan of R.S.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.520]   (laughing)
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.840]   - No, in fact, I know Robert,
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.320]   you probably don't use a news reader anymore, do you?
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.000]   - I, Twitter is my news reader,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.200]   which Twitter is really an RSS news reader now, right?
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.840]   So many sites bring their feeds into Twitter
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.080]   through one of the various services
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   that convert RSS into tweets.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:10.920]   - I guess.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.680]   - And blog, for instance, I have scoble blog on Twitter.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.200]   It's an RSS feed, though.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.080]   - You don't use Google Reader anymore, though.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.600]   - Not much.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.080]   - And Kevin, you disagree.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.280]   You think RSS is-- - Yeah, I mean,
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.400]   I had RSS on Google Reader for a while,
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.880]   and it was clearly just a geeky thing.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.440]   I don't know anyone outside of our bubble
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440]   that really uses it.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.320]   I mean, there are some people that are technology enthusiasts
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.760]   that are into it, but it really never caught on mainstream.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.000]   I mean, if you ask anyone what RSS is out on the street,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.920]   they'll have no idea what you're talking about.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.440]   The enclosures was a nice addition for podcasting,
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.160]   and it all gave us all a boost,
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.520]   but I think that's the focal point for you.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.520]   - Would anybody have a clue what TCP IP is or what,
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.320]   you know, ATQT is? - No,
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.360]   and I think that's what RSS is at this point.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.800]   It is an underlying protocol.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.400]   It is not, nobody uses a news reader per se,
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.920]   but we all use RSS every day.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.760]   - Really?
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.160]   I mean, just give me an example of like,
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.840]   okay, my mom or dad or even the sister of--
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.720]   - Facebook brings a lot of stuff in through RSS.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.840]   You don't even see it.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.920]   - Really?
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.680]   - Yeah, you can just find a blog.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.360]   - My blog comes in a Facebook through RSS,
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.320]   but anybody who comes over to my page
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.280]   doesn't have any clue it's RSS.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.760]   - But do most people do that?
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.680]   No.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.560]   No people do that. - Yeah, a lot of people do it.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.560]   - Well, they, you know, 'cause they use Facebook
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.560]   or they use Twitter, so they don't know they're using RSS.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.320]   - I don't think they use it to bring their stuff in.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.160]   - Oh, I know.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.280]   - Do people use it as a publisher so much?
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.800]   - And I have to say even-- - I don't know what it is.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.920]   - Even though that this company,
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.960]   Twitt started as a podcast company and used RSS,
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.880]   and still does, from the majority of people
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.720]   who are listening to this show
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.560]   will be listening via RSS.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.480]   And we've created video and people keep saying,
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.720]   "When's there an RSS feed? When's there an RSS feed?"
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.920]   I don't think that the future is
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.920]   of delivery by shows via RSS, or at least not visibly.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.480]   I'm hoping-- - That I do agree with.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.840]   I think Twitter is-- - It's too hard.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.560]   - My reading behavior.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.440]   - It's too hard. - Facebook has changed it
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.760]   for everybody else, right?
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.800]   - Yeah.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.640]   - I guess, you know what, Robert,
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.680]   I will agree with you on this.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.640]   I think that RSS in my mind is all about the fact
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.120]   that it created a structured way for us,
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.920]   geeks behind the scenes to publish content
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.400]   that will come in the form of subscribing to,
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.680]   you know, Twitt on a rock you player or whatever it may be.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.720]   But the in-consumer will never know what RSS is.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.720]   And I think that RSS as a reader,
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.120]   like a Google reader, will never hit mainstream.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.920]   I don't think people will even care that much
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.920]   to go and find that little RSS icon and click Add.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.160]   - I agree, even as hardcore geeks,
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.640]   no longer use readers, right?
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.760]   And we were the guys who used readers.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.880]   - Yeah. - I launched that
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.760]   newswire every once in a while, and I go,
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.320]   "Ugh."
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.160]   - It's like an inbox. - It's like an inbox, right?
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.360]   - It's an inbox. - You're like, "Ugh."
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.440]   - If there's something good here,
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.720]   I'll hear about it through Twitter or--
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.920]   - Exactly. - Or I'll get on gig
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.800]   or whatever it may be.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.280]   You know, there's so many other ways to get our news there.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.320]   - So I get back to my point, which is,
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.240]   it's aggregation alone is insufficient.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.120]   That's what RSS did was aggregation.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.960]   It takes curation.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.800]   That's what, that's the insight you had for Dig.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.760]   That's what Twitter does.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.640]   It's aggregation plus curation that makes something useful.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.640]   And, you know, I think that ultimately curation
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.280]   is where all of us who create content add value.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.160]   It's one thing to create content, but then that,
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.040]   but what you should, what you need to do
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.880]   to make yourself valuable is to curate as well.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.800]   I mean, that's what this show is.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.480]   We're curating a bunch of ideas, bringing them forward,
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.280]   saying these are ideas worth talking about,
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.080]   worth thinking about. - Yep.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.960]   - Catherine Hall is a photographer who has an interesting
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.800]   point of view.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.840]   She's been on Twitch some time, several times.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.840]   Nice, nice, very good photographer.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.320]   - Hello, my name is Catherine Hall,
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.600]   and I'm a professional photographer.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.800]   One of my favorite tech stories is the way that
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.360]   the internet and laptops have revolutionized my business.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:57.600]   And basically giving me the ability to work from anywhere.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.760]   So here I am in the Gulf right now,
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.600]   working from my laptop and here's my internet card
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.240]   and sleeping on a yacht.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.080]   - Show off.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.840]   - And basically able to do my work.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.000]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.280]   - Like Patrick Norton, she's using a EVDO.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.080]   Internet everywhere is huge.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.880]   - That's a big one for the last few years.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.560]   I can't travel without my Verizon EVDO card.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.920]   It's awesome.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.000]   - That's how we're gonna be doing a lot of what we do at CES.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.320]   This will be very interesting.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.240]   We bought a box or a renting a box
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.760]   called the Mushroom Portabella.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.000]   Mushroom's the company, Portabella's the unit.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.800]   And it's weird, you plug in four or more EVDO cards,
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.320]   preferably from different providers.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.800]   It aggregates the bandwidth,
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.080]   then you plug a camera into it.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.840]   We'll actually be using it to Skype
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.520]   so we have two-way connections.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.040]   And now we have a portable unit.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.920]   We're gonna go to the parties.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.880]   - Do these really work though?
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.360]   The member back in tech TV days,
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.360]   we were doing these cable modem routers.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.360]   The two cable modes in and they would combine the bandwidth
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.200]   and give you a faster, and they never works.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.760]   - I'm praying it works.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.560]   (laughing)
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.640]   - I was doing quick videos for the last two years
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.280]   on the show floor at CES.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.120]   - I know.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.200]   - We've created 3G coverage now, which is pretty amazing.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.040]   - Well, Sprint especially is big in Vegas.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.920]   AT&T, not so hot.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.280]   - AT&T, anywhere.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.000]   (laughing)
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:23.840]   - What do you mean?
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.880]   I got five bars here in my house now.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.240]   - That's not the story of the decade,
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.600]   but definitely the story of the year
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.040]   is how AT&T won the smartphone wars
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.880]   and lost all of its customers' loyalty
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.280]   by being just the crappiest.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.680]   - You know, that's gonna be the story next year.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.680]   The big story next year,
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.880]   well, aside from the tablet,
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.360]   will be the fact that Apple switches to Verizon.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.160]   - Oh, good prediction.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.920]   Yeah, maybe not a prediction, maybe just wishful thinking.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.720]   - Yeah, well, the contract's up, so yeah.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.120]   - I think the big story is if Apple doesn't do that,
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.560]   Google's Android is gonna force Apple
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.920]   to be reactionary to them.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.120]   Google's Maps on the Android is car superior
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.600]   to Google Maps on iPhone.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.800]   And so is Google Voice and so are some other apps.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.920]   And if they just shave off the corners
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.640]   of that device, 'cause the device is clunky
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.200]   and the OS is a little clunky,
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:19.320]   they're gonna be the mobile OS next year.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.040]   - I really like Android.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   I really like the Droid phone actually quite a bit,
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.160]   especially because of the Verizon connectivity.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.040]   What about Nexus One?
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.280]   What about the, you've probably seen the rumors crazy
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.480]   that they might be that Google January 5th
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:39.640]   is gonna start offering its own HTC design,
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.200]   HTC built, but Google designed phone
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.160]   and they say buy invitation.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.240]   Does that make any sense?
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.200]   - I think Google is gonna do some really interesting stuff
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.720]   in mobile next year.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.400]   And I, it's where they need to be.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.000]   - I would buy a Google phone, right?
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.840]   - Google has a brand name that everybody
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.240]   in the world recognizes and feels some affinity to.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.960]   And it's really interesting to see that go against app.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.200]   - You'd buy a Google phone, you'd buy an Apple phone.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.160]   Would you buy a Microsoft phone?
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.000]   - No, not in the, not for a while.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.320]   - Hell no.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.720]   - Well, the one wild card Microsoft has is Xbox Live.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.600]   If they can bring out a mobile device
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.760]   that hooks into Xbox Live in some interesting way,
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.600]   that will get me interested.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.480]   But that's the only wild card that they have at this point.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.000]   - Interesting to see.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.520]   Bobby Lew, Bobby Lewellen, who is of course
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.760]   on The Great Red Dwarf, a television show,
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.600]   plays Crayton the Robot and has a great podcast
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.240]   called Carpool, comes to us from UK.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.080]   - Hi, Bobby Lewellen here in the good old UK of England.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.960]   I'm thinking that in the last 10 years,
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.680]   the most influential piece of technology,
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.200]   certainly that affected my life, was YouTube.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.400]   I tried to do video on the internet for many years
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.560]   before YouTube appeared and it was a miserable experience,
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.560]   to say the least.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.880]   I think YouTube rocks, I think it's just an extraordinary
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.240]   new medium that we're still all learning how to use.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.400]   So I think for me in the last 10 years, YouTube has it.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.160]   For the next 10 years, I'd just like to predict something else.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.160]   And no Leo, it's not a new Mustang,
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.600]   so I'd love to have a go in it.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.960]   It's this little baby.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.600]   (water splashing)
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.920]   - That's a Mitsubishi electric car he's driving off there.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.560]   You think electric cars are gonna be the next big thing?
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.320]   (both laughing)
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.160]   - Maybe, I mean, I certainly would love a Tesla,
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.520]   they're too expensive and the infrastructure
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.960]   just isn't there yet to support most Americans
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.560]   getting in an electric car.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.120]   The Tesla goes what, 240 miles an hour on a single charge.
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.760]   That's not enough to get up to the Sierra's,
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.400]   so I can't use it as my only car.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.680]   - Chevy Volt's gonna be interesting because it's got
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.040]   a gas engine, but it's not like a hybrid,
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.160]   it's got a gas engine generator,
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.840]   so you can at least get some power out of it
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.920]   if you run out of battery.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.680]   I would buy a Volt.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.600]   - As long as it's reliable.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.400]   - I kind of regret to be honest.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.680]   - I'm not sure I would sign up to be the first one.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.240]   - As much as I like the Mustang,
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.960]   I kind of regret not buying a Ford Fusion.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.640]   By the way, Ford Fusion sales up 67% this year.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.800]   - Hey Leo, you heard what David Prager did, right?
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:18.640]   - No.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.560]   - You actually put his name on the list
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.960]   for one of the new Teslas.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.640]   I don't know Tesla, but the other one that--
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.720]   - The sedan?
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.040]   - Yeah, the sedan.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.320]   - You're overpaying the boy.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.960]   (both laughing)
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.320]   - They're 45 or something like that.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.440]   - Oh, that's not bad.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.280]   - Oh, that's not bad.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.200]   - I mean, it's expensive, but it's not crazy crazy.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.520]   - No, that's not bad at all.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.440]   No, I'm very tempted.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.280]   I looked at it.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.760]   I was very tempted, but I just, you know,
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.280]   do you really think Tesla's gonna be around?
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.080]   - Well, Ford has some cars coming out after CES
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.360]   that'll be very interesting in this space.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.400]   And Toyota just announced a plug-in hybrid,
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.880]   so all you need is more batteries,
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.720]   which raises the price of the car.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.760]   - I like plug-in hybrids.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.600]   I really think the plug-in hybrid is a good model
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.360]   because then you've got best of both worlds, right?
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.800]   You can still use gas, but you plug it in,
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.920]   so you can only use electricity
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.200]   for at least the first 100 miles.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.440]   - But again, you gotta buy more batteries
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.960]   to make it happen. - Which means more weight.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.040]   - That's more weight and more cost, right?
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.840]   - That's something that didn't happen in this decade,
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.440]   which was an improvement in the least in battery technology.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.800]   Or solar efficiency, solar cell efficiency.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.800]   That's something that has to happen in the next decade.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.600]   And I don't know where that invention is.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.480]   We were talking a little bit last year
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.760]   with Steve Gibson, who's very excited
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.880]   about the idea of ultra capacitors,
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.120]   which are very high power devices.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.280]   Take a while to charge unless you have a high voltage plug,
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.400]   but then can charge very quickly
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.520]   and have a lot of power in them
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.660]   and are much smaller, much more compact.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.960]   - And also-- - And the chat room,
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.080]   by the way, are arguing with you
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.160]   that batteries haven't improved.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.000]   I think they're right that they haven't improved,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.200]   but that our expectations have far exceeded
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.440]   the improvements that have been--
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.280]   - I guess you're right.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.800]   I mean, if you look at the iPhone 10 years ago,
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.520]   I would have had to have a shoulder pack for this.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.800]   So you're right.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.040]   Let the Mion in the,
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.920]   has certainly been a big improvement.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.800]   - Definitely laptops.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.320]   You guys remember the laptops back in 2001?
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.400]   - Oh, God. - Back in 2001.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.000]   - You get 30 minutes. - Yeah.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.920]   - Yeah. - And they were in the backlit.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.960]   Yeah, black and white screens.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.120]   - 'Cause you have a tech runner or whatever they were.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   - Tech runner, yeah.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.160]   - Tech runner, tech runner. - Tech runner, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.720]   - Tech runner, I think was the high end one or something.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.200]   - Right. - And the port is--
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.720]   - They was about the point about YouTube.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.560]   I agree.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.400]   I think YouTube is revolutionary.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.240]   - All of this internet content is revolutionary,
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.840]   but YouTube itself just, boy,
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.680]   did they catalyze something?
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.960]   - I mean, last night I was watching videos
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.840]   of the protests in Tehran,
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.040]   you know, and some of the beatings and stuff on YouTube.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.720]   You know, the fact that we now have the ability
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.040]   to send high def video to each other is just extraordinary.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.800]   - Truly revolutionary.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.760]   - I mean, you know, Leo, when you start tech TV,
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.800]   how much money did it cost to start tech TV?
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.640]   - Oh, I don't even talk about it.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.280]   I think-- - Hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.520]   - By the time Paul Allen was done,
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.520]   I think he'd lost $300 million.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.480]   - Yeah.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.120]   And that wasn't even HD.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.200]   - No.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.520]   (laughs)
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.040]   - That was 640 by 480.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.400]   - Well, get to HD.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.840]   Another very big story of the decade in just a second,
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.920]   but I do want to talk about audible.com.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.640]   Actually, audible, for me,
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.760]   has been an important part of my decade.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.280]   I started using audio books
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.880]   when I had that long commute to tech TV in 1998,
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.040]   and at the beginning I was using cassettes.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.000]   By 2001, audible came along and transformed my life.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.720]   At first, audible played on this, the Diamond Rio.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.520]   That's how I listened to my audio books on audible.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.840]   They also made their own device,
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.360]   which is kind of a clunky device.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.400]   I don't think it's around anymore.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.280]   Now they're on hundreds of devices,
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.000]   including of course all the iPods, iPhones, the Zunes,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   even things, weird things like GPS devices,
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.640]   many of them play audible content.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.040]   Your Kindle plays audio content from audible.com.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:09.240]   Audible is a great resource for people who love reading,
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.680]   especially people who love reading
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.040]   and never find the time to read.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.000]   If you're stuck driving the car a lot,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.160]   you can't find the time to read,
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:18.960]   but you're in the car.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:22.240]   Audible means you can listen to the best sellers.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:26.040]   You can listen to great history, non-fiction, humor,
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.040]   fiction in your car, at work, at the gym,
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.720]   anywhere where you can't hold the book.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:34.560]   - Jim is huge.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.280]   - Do you know rock climb with Audible, do you?
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.600]   - No, I do tread mill stuff.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.320]   - All that boring crap.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.400]   - Yeah, I mean, when you're doing the boring tread mill
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.400]   stuff, there's nothing like it.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.920]   I get all my reading done, frankly, at the gym.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.200]   Audible is great for that.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.640]   Now we've got a special deal for you.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.520]   You can get your Audible account right now.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:55.880]   Sign up for the Platinum account.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.920]   That's actually a really good deal
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.680]   for the Audible sign up.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.960]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.960]   That's gonna give you two books a month
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.280]   and the first two are free.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.760]   Now normally we talk about the gold account,
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.600]   but they let me talk about the Platinum account
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.640]   'cause they know that Twit listeners are loaded.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.520]   They're smart.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.720]   They like to read and they wanna listen to Audible.com.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.880]   Two books.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.880]   It's not that expensive, what is it?
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.840]   15 bucks a month.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.680]   I can't remember.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.240]   That's the account I have.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.720]   It's Believe Me, it's worth it.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.960]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.520]   Take a look at all the great choices.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.560]   Are you listening to the one?
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.200]   How about this one for you, Kevin?
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.280]   Leaving Las Vegas.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.920]   Remember that great Nickliss Cage movie?
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.320]   It's a novel by John O'Brien.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.560]   - Yeah, I just got something off of the other day.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.560]   I got the Book of Secrets by Deepak Chopra.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.160]   - Oh, you've always been kind of that
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.960]   that earthy crunchy kind of guy, aren't you?
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.200]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.800]   - You're very new age.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.160]   People don't know that about Kevin.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.000]   They think Kevin's--
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.920]   - I do like my granola and sine milk.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.520]   - Yeah, and tea.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.920]   You love the tea.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.360]   I bet there's some good books about tea.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.560]   How about three cups of tea?
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.400]   Boy, is that a great book.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.760]   You can get that on Audible too.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.640]   I highly recommend Audible and I invite you
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.560]   to try it absolutely free.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.840]   Two books are yours to keep,
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.040]   even if you cancel at any time.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.440]   Three Cups of Tea by Greg Mortensen.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.520]   I'm gonna recommend this one.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.440]   This is an amazing story.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:21.320]   And in fact, he started a charity
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.680]   that my kids school is very involved in,
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:24.840]   called Schools for Caboold.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.880]   They're building schools for girls in Afghanistan.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.480]   Absolutely transformative.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.240]   This book will fill you in on one man's mission
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.960]   to fight terrorism and build nations.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.520]   Three Cups of Tea is very inspiring.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.280]   Greg Mortensen.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.500]   It's one of many, many, many books you can get at
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.840]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.160]   We thank them so much for their support
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:51.720]   of this week in tech and all the shows on the Twit Network.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.160]   In fact, we thank all of our sponsors.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.920]   It's been a great year.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.720]   How do you get to be a sponsor, by the way, Leo?
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.360]   Give me money.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.800]   You love it, who should we call?
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.600]   No, all our ads go through a pod track.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.040]   So just contract Mark McCrae, a pod track,
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.680]   and why you got somebody who wants to sponsor the show?
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.880]   Yeah, my boss was asking in Skype right now,
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.040]   how do I sell his Rackspace sponsor to the show?
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.040]   I will get used to,
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.400]   text me as a phone number, no salesmen will call.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.080]   However, I will be glad to talk to him about it.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.880]   We'd love to have Rackspace as a sponsor, absolutely.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.680]   I think the world of Rackspace.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.160]   And I'm gonna like it even more when they buy ads.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.680]   Big story, this is from Australia.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.680]   We've got two Australians in the audience today
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.680]   visiting us from Sydney and TechAU sent us this via vidli.com.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.680]   Oh, this is Jason from We're Dungar's Tri here.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.760]   And I think the story of the decade
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.560]   has to be high definition.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.640]   Over the past 10 years, my work environment,
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.160]   my home setup, and definitely my home theater system
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.080]   has significantly changed.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.680]   I'm now running a 52 inch television,
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.280]   Xbox 360, PlayStation 3,
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:04.840]   sitting in front of two 27 inch monitors at the moment
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:08.520]   and love living in a high definition world.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.160]   So for me, it has to be high deaf.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.240]   It's interesting 'cause I didn't realize
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.880]   is high deaf, huge in Australia.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.400]   Everybody's got HD TVs now
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.600]   and the broadcasters broadcast on high deaf and...
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.920]   It's 1080i, okay.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.520]   Because I know that this really started in the US
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.680]   a decade ago when the FCC did the kind of surprising thing
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.240]   they said to the broadcast stations,
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.480]   dudes, you're going digital, whether you like it or not.
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.320]   We're taking that frequency back from you.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.360]   They put it off, they put it off.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.720]   It finally happened this year in June.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.480]   The stations went digital.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.680]   And what they told consumers was,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.240]   if you wanna watch,
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.840]   you're gonna have to get a digital TV.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.720]   Now for a lot of people that meant a new TV
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.800]   and when that meant a new TV, it meant an HD TV.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.280]   And I think that that really,
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.960]   I don't know if it was an intended consequence,
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.320]   but an unintended consequence of the digital migration
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.880]   of broadcast television in the US
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.880]   was the mass adoption of high deaf televisions.
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.000]   If you had to get a digital TV, why not get an HD TV?
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.080]   Everybody's got them now.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.160]   And who would have thought in 1999,
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.680]   if I had told you, Kevin Rose,
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:12.200]   you would be buying a $3,000 TV in 2010,
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.760]   you'd say you're nuts.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.480]   $3,000.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.240]   It's funny though, how quickly, you get used to HD
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.280]   and there's no going back.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.080]   Like if you start watching football and HD
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.840]   and then see it on this inner deaf television,
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.000]   it's like the worst thing ever.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.360]   Yeah, it's fuzzy.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.520]   I wanna see the blades of grass.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.760]   I wanna see the drops of sweat.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.600]   That's right.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.880]   And the thinness of the TVs.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.720]   I mean, did you see the Panasonic TVs?
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.880]   They're like 50 inches in there.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.720]   This thick.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.560]   Wow.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.400]   It's really crazy.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.360]   We're gonna see a lot of those at CES.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.360]   I guess the top one right now is the Samsung 8500 LCD
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.280]   which is I think 1.6 inches thick.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.440]   I just bought a Kuro,
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.480]   'cause you know, Pioneer's getting out of the plasma business.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.600]   I got a Kuro as well.
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.080]   This is your last chance, you know?
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.040]   And these are still the best TVs out there.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:57.960]   Great blacks.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.880]   Yeah, incredible TV.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.400]   We couldn't figure it out.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.080]   I'm kind of embarrassed.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.440]   We couldn't figure it out how to turn it on
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.480]   so we sent it back and then somebody told me,
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:07.840]   "Oh, there's a hidden switch."
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.280]   It's like, "Oh, jeez."
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.880]   (laughs)
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.560]   So they're gonna send us another one.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.400]   Oops.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.560]   Absolutely HD.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.800]   This is the decade of HD.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.480]   And you know, I think we're beginning something new.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.920]   We were talking before the show began.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.720]   You've all seen Avatar.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.520]   I just finally saw it last night.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.840]   I don't know about 3D.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.720]   I'm still, I think the jury's still out on 3D.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.080]   I don't think this is the revolution
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:32.960]   that people hope it will be.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.680]   Even though the motion picture industry
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.040]   and the television manufacturers
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.840]   are all going for it in a big way.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.360]   But I do think that the technology that Avatar perfected
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.440]   that is gonna transform motion pictures is motion capture.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.360]   What'd you, I mean, Kevin,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.080]   you've seen it twice now in IMAX, right?
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.440]   Yeah, unbelievable.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.400]   I mean, the animation was--
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.400]   It's real.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.240]   It's realistic.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.280]   They look like real people.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.800]   Signorating Weavers, Avatar looks like Sigourney Weaver.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.200]   I love how they make the girl aliens
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.680]   like just hot enough to where you're like,
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.520]   hmm, I could definitely ask you.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.680]   Did you have that reaction?
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.000]   I had that exact reaction.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   I thought, oh, she's kind of cute.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.480]   I know she's eight feet tall, but--
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.480]   And blue.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.680]   And blue, but she's kind of cute.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.520]   Totally.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.040]   It's funny that you had that reaction
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.080]   'cause I had that exact reaction
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   'cause normally aliens, you know, well, they're aliens,
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.720]   but they were all very attractive.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   Yes.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.320]   It's the first time I've seen a,
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.760]   I saw Beowulf, which I don't know if you remember that.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.160]   It was kind of a weird movie,
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.320]   but it had, it was all CGI, motion capture,
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.640]   maybe even rotoscoped CGI,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.920]   and it had some nudity in it.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:47.480]   But it was like, eh, eh, eh, it's not real.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.480]   It's a cartoon.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.240]   These guys were--
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.680]   Well, if I was with Angelina Jolie
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.520]   as the main Netflix writer, yeah.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.960]   It wasn't a great movie,
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.720]   but this, I think, shows you how,
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.880]   where Hollywood's going.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.960]   They would love to motion capture
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.240]   all these movie stars and then let 'em go out the pasture.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.480]   Go ahead, go, get old.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:08.680]   We don't care, we gotcha.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.800]   It was really remarkable.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.640]   So you both liked the movie,
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.800]   did you like it, Robert?
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.640]   Absolutely.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.120]   Must see and must see in 3D,
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.160]   and if you can get to an IMAX theater,
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.000]   definitely do that.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.080]   So you liked, so you liked,
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.400]   the glasses didn't bother you.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.560]   Didn't bother me at all.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.360]   It was a weird feeling getting out of the theater,
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.680]   and it was like, wow,
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.160]   I was so involved in the movie
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.440]   that now I'm back in real life,
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.960]   and it felt disranting a little bit.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.440]   I wanted to be blue and eight feet tall.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.320]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.000]   These hot alien chicks.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.400]   I wanna tail, a Jack in tail.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.000]   Oh, yeah, they, oh yeah.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.120]   For the first hour and a half of the movie,
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.760]   I was totally like bothered by the glasses,
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.320]   and more so bothered by the tricks they were doing
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.880]   to show off the 3D, you know,
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.400]   stuff coming at you and stuff.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.000]   I thought this is just distracting.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.160]   I'd like to see this in 2D, please.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.320]   But the story is so gripping,
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.520]   that by halfway through,
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.320]   you just can't, you know,
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.760]   I think it's right when he tames the flying beast.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.760]   It's like, okay, I'm in it.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.320]   I forgot about the glasses.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.720]   I'll be right back.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.960]   I'm gonna go get Baby RSS.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.480]   All right, while you get Baby RSS,
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.560]   let's see what Gina Tripani thinks was
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:22.640]   the big story of the decade.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.960]   She's with Life Hacker, of course.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.840]   Hey, this is Gina Tripani from This Week in Google,
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.200]   and my favorite tech story of this past decade
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.400]   is The Rise of the Blog.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.080]   I mean, Blog started in the late '90s,
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.320]   but it really wasn't until this decade after the 9/11,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.760]   and when Google purchased Blogger.com in 2003,
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.920]   that blogs truly democratized publishing,
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.960]   and gave armchair pundits, you know,
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.480]   like myself, a printing press,
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.680]   an ability to reach thousands of people every day.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:51.360]   Can you imagine an internet without blogs?
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.200]   I can't at this point, and that happened this decade.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.360]   That's interesting, 'cause some might say
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.040]   the blog is kind of history.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.520]   It's been replaced by microblogging
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.080]   and other forms of expression on the internet.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.920]   You still do a blog, Kevin, but like me,
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.120]   you do it once in a while, right?
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.320]   Yeah, I just don't update it as much as I used to.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.400]   You know, I used to be one of those things
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.000]   where you'd think, oh, I gotta get something out
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.160]   every few days.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.440]   Now you tweet.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.080]   Yeah, if you have an important link
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.360]   that you wanna share out, if you have a video even,
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.120]   you post it on YouTube, and then you link to it on Twitter,
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:20.960]   right?
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.560]   Like there's no need to really go out
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.640]   and do that full-blown blog.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:25.640]   Right.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.400]   I think this was the decade of the blog,
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.440]   but I think it's past tense somewhat.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.480]   Robert, you're a huge blogger.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.360]   Is the blog still important?
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.320]   Yeah, it still is important because, you know,
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.120]   every once in a while you have something you wanna say
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.880]   that's more than 140 characters.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.240]   Yeah, you have to have somewhere to write.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.840]   I think what's happened is the blog,
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.520]   blog as a blog is meaningless.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.920]   It's now just a web page, right?
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.880]   Exactly, that's what I was just gonna say.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.000]   The big blogs to me have not,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.800]   I don't still think of them as, oh, that's a blog I go to.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.520]   It's just another website, right?
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.520]   It's content.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.160]   It's not the hub where you follow,
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.960]   like I follow Kevin Rose on twitter.com/KevinRose.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:10.640]   I don't follow him on his blog anymore on his website.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.640]   It's not the hub, but you're right.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.360]   And this is something, this is why I didn't like
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.360]   the word podcast, I don't like the word blog either.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.920]   It's all just content, and why pigeonhole it?
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:20.880]   It's just content.
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.960]   We do stuff, and with Twitter and other,
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.880]   and four square and other sites,
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.960]   Friend Feed, we now have ways of publicizing what we're doing.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.680]   If you're interested, you go read it.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.920]   You might go read it on our blog,
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.080]   you might go watch it on YouTube,
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.520]   but you don't have to get a wise this all anymore.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:41.920]   Dr. Kiki has a thought about the big story of,
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.640]   oops, let me press that button of the decade,
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.280]   host of This Week in Science, and Dr. Kiki says it.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.400]   Hi, my Twitch story of the decade
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.320]   is the Large Hadron Collider.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.680]   Seriously, it is the biggest piece of technology
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.720]   on the planet right now,
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.720]   the most complicated piece of technology,
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:00.080]   and it's going to help us find out about our universe.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.320]   People have been talking about it
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.840]   for the better part of the decade,
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:06.880]   and it came to pass that it actually works during the decade.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:10.440]   So that is my story of the year for Twitch's story
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.280]   of the decade.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.120]   Happy new year.
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.400]   Happy new year, thank you, Dr. Kiki.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.240]   What's interesting is CERN was the story of last decade, right?
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.480]   Where did the web come from?
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.720]   It came from CERN.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.520]   Particle physicists rule.
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.680]   And touring that machine, it's impressive.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.680]   Yeah, I got a tour of the LHC.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.800]   It's a stunning machine.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.840]   Wow.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.160]   And now you can't tour it anymore
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.360]   because it's underground and they don't let you down there.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.200]   But it's stunning.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.800]   And you can't go into the LHC
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.920]   'cause you might drop a bag yet
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.000]   and take the whole thing offline for six more months.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.400]   (laughing)
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.520]   Now you'd be re-rated, that's the problem.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.440]   When it's actually live and they're spinning,
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.360]   your tons are like,
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.640]   Oh yeah, you don't wanna, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.400]   You know why I get in the way of a Higgs boson.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.520]   That thing is a tough ass particle.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.480]   Alex Lindsey thinks that video is also pretty important.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.080]   Of course he's the video king.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.080]   Hey everyone, this is Alex.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.800]   And of course, I think one of the big things
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:06.360]   that happened this last decade is video on the web.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.320]   I mean, I started doing it in 2001 and it was painful.
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.800]   It was expensive, it was ugly.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.880]   And now you have everybody with a flip camera shooting with it.
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.640]   And so I think that, you know,
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.920]   there's still a business model that needs to be created,
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.880]   but some people are, like a lot of us on this show,
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.720]   figuring that out.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:26.280]   So hopefully it's just gonna keep on growing
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.120]   over the next decade.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.520]   But I think that what happened in web video,
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.040]   as far as how it affects the individual
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.840]   and the corporation and the broadcast companies,
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.240]   is pretty groundbreaking.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.280]   - Of course, Alex shot that with a 5D Mark II.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:40.680]   That's pretty terrible. - Right, exactly.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.520]   That's a good saying.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.880]   It's video-less amazing.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:46.160]   - He's got depth of field, he's got detail.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.360]   Guess how he shot that one.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.320]   That's pretty darn obvious, isn't it?
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.560]   - That's funny.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.680]   Figures he'd shoot it that way.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:56.320]   One more from Mark Pelletier, we're gonna wrap it up soon,
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.720]   but Mark hosts our Futures in BioTech.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.240]   And I think this may not have been the decade of BioTech,
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.280]   although it was the decade that the Genome Project
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.360]   finally yielded fruit.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.960]   But I think the coming decade might well be
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:11.280]   the an amazing decade when it comes to BioTech.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.680]   Let's see what Mark Pelletier,
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.120]   a Futures in BioTech has to say.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.480]   - Okay.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.320]   Okay. - Hey, Twits,
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:18.880]   the story I'd like to share.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.320]   It may not only be the story of the decade,
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.040]   but possibly of the millennium.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.720]   I first learned about it when I was researching
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.040]   for Futures in BioTech episode two back in 2006.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.760]   Leo and I interviewed Leonard Granti from MIT.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.440]   Dr. Granti was the first to discover genes
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:36.080]   that could modulate lifespan, the Sootuin family of genes.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.880]   These genes are more precisely the enzymes that they encode,
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.760]   can, when activated, result in a metabolic state
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.960]   that mimics caloric restriction.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.200]   Choloric restriction has long been known to extend lifespan.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.960]   But now we understand one of the important underlying mechanisms
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.720]   thanks to Granti's work.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.440]   A collaborative, his Davidson Claire at Harvard Medical School
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.200]   then went on to search for drugs that could activate
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.520]   the Sootuin's and identified Resveratrol,
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.880]   a compound found in red wine thought to be responsible
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.680]   for the French paradox.
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:07.800]   Sinclair founded a company with Christoph Westfall
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.520]   which sold this year to Glaxo Smith-Gline,
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.120]   a company who's called Sertris.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:15.160]   And Glaxo Smith-Gline bought them for $720 million.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.000]   - Wow.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.200]   - And the Sootuin family of the Sootuin family
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.600]   is a very important part of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.600]   And the Sootuin family of the Sootuin family
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:25.000]   is a very important part of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.400]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.200]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.800]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.400]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:36.200]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.800]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.200]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.200]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.200]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.200]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.200]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.200]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.200]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.200]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.200]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.200]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.200]   And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.200]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.200]   - Wow.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.200]   - And the Sootuin family is a very important part
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.200]   of the Sootuin family.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.200]   - Wow.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200]   - Wow.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.200]   - Wow.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.200]   - Wow.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.200]   - Wow.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.200]   - Wow.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.200]   - Imagine.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.200]   - I've actually heard of a bunch of these doctors
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.200]   that are doing this research are actually practicing
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.200]   caloric restrictions themselves.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.200]   - Right.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.200]   - And anybody can do that at home obviously,
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.200]   but it's gonna take years and years and years
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.200]   before we find out whether or not it's working.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.200]   - Well, but that's the thing about resveratrol
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.200]   is that it mimics the effect of it without caloric restriction.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.200]   So you continue to eat.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:38.200]   You get to eat normally,
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.200]   because you know caloric restriction,
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.200]   you have to reduce your calories to about,
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:46.200]   you know, like 30 or 40% below what you would normally eat.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.200]   You're basically starving.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.200]   - Apparently you look horrible and lose a bunch of weight
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.200]   and it's just not really healthy, healthy,
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.200]   but you live forever.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.200]   - You may not live forever,
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.200]   but you may not live forever.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:57.200]   You may not live forever.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.200]   You'll feel like you live in forever.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.200]   You'll be miserable.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.200]   - Right.
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.200]   - So this--
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.200]   - I don't want to live forever.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.200]   - No, no, no, but this drug in effect
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.200]   duplicates that result because obviously
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.200]   caloric restriction isn't, well, maybe not obviously,
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.200]   but apparently with caloric restriction
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.200]   isn't what extends life.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.200]   It's a side effect of it.
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.200]   And if they can perfect these sirtuins, these drugs,
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:19.200]   these hormones and give you the hormone
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.200]   without actually perpetuating, you know,
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.200]   this caloric restriction.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.200]   Now we're talking.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.200]   - When I first heard this, I mean,
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.200]   a few years ago, I was pretty stuck because in theory,
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.200]   you just drank a bunch of red wine,
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:34.200]   but the amount of that rest of all that's in the red wine is--
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.200]   - No.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.200]   - So slim.
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:38.200]   - Yeah, I was stuck too.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.200]   (laughs)
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.200]   Any stories that we didn't cover that were,
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.200]   you think, huge stories for 2000?
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.200]   Actually, let me etch you who is one of our Swedish viewers.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.200]   I want to get him on because this has to do with you
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.200]   and HDTV, and I love Sweden.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.200]   - Hello, I'm Dennis from Sweden,
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.200]   and I think one of the biggest tech stories of the decade
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.200]   was the whole HD DVD debacle on the dig.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.200]   It really showed the impact and the effect
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.200]   that the community have.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.200]   It transcended the dig and showed what was possible
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.200]   in the new era of the internet.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.200]   - Dig the code.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.200]   I think he's talking about dig the code, right?
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.200]   - That was crazy.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.200]   That was the time when the HDD DVD key leaked down the internet.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:23.200]   People started posting stories to dig,
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.200]   and we took it down because we thought--
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.200]   - You thought you had to?
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.200]   - You thought you had to.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.200]   - Material will be a synesthetist, decent assist, you know,
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.200]   like take it down and we'll see you and we have,
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:34.200]   you all know how deep pockets the people that were backing
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.200]   at the time HDD DVD had.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.200]   So, yeah, I mean, it blew up and there was nothing
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.200]   we could do to stop it.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.200]   I mean, there was thousands of submissions, comments,
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.200]   YouTube videos of people singing the key.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.200]   - Callynose sang the key.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.200]   - It was just crazy.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.200]   - We named that Twitter episode with the key that week.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.200]   Although I think I've changed one letter
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.200]   because I didn't want to get sued either.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.200]   - I mean, it just goes to show you that the masses
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.200]   can assemble on the internet now and take action.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.200]   You know, that was really kind of the big story there.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.200]   - Yeah, in some ways that was a precursor
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.200]   to what's happening in Iran.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.200]   I mean, not as important obviously, but still in many ways.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.200]   - I think the one story that we haven't really heard
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.200]   underlying is Facebook.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:16.200]   I think that's the company of the decade.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:19.200]   Google was a company that came along last decade that clearly
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.200]   has changed all of our lives.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.200]   And, you know, my wife, I watch her, she talks to all of her
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.200]   elementary school friends from Tehran, you know, who are now
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.200]   all over the world.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.200]   And that's just a little tiny story when I go anywhere in the
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.200]   world, everybody's on Facebook.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.200]   And it's one of those companies that comes along once every
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.200]   decade or so.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.200]   - It really is huge, isn't it?
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.200]   That's a very good point.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.200]   I mean, there's--
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.200]   - I mean, that and the founder behind it too.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.200]   I mean, think of how young Mark Zuckerberg was when he started
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:52.200]   the site and just what he's done at that age is just insane.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:55.200]   - Every time I see video of Mark, I go, "My God, he's a kid."
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.200]   - He is a kid.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.200]   - I mean, he's 12 and was a kid.
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.200]   - I thought Kevin was a kid.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.200]   - Yeah, this really, I mean, geez, Louise.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.200]   - They're best software designer.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.200]   Chris Putnam, I knew him when he was 16 and he would let me
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.200]   listen to him play piano, you know?
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.200]   - Oh man.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.200]   - I've got an awesome story that I don't think I've ever told
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:21.200]   anybody, but I was at South by Southwest two years ago or three
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:26.200]   years ago and two years ago and Mark Zuckerberg was there.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.200]   And we were hanging out at this bar and there was just a bunch
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.200]   of people around and everyone was about to do a shot.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.200]   And tequila shots were coming down the line and Mark leans over
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.200]   to me and because everyone was kind of doing the salt thing and
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.200]   he's just like, "How do I do this?"
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:44.200]   And I'm like, "Okay, look with your hand, take the shot,
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.200]   take the line."
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.200]   And I think something was so awesome.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.200]   - You know I said, "You have no idea."
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.200]   - "You have no idea."
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.200]   - Well, that's pretty good.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.200]   That's your claim to fame, Kevin Rose.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.200]   You taught Mark Zuckerberg how to do tequila shots.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.200]   - Right.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.200]   - And I might have taught you how to do tequila shots.
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.200]   - I think that actually works.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200]   It's filtered down.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200]   - You're gonna do it.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.200]   - I'm sorry.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.200]   (laughing)
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.200]   - And David Chung taught me how to do tequila shots.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.200]   Hey guys, really, this has been a great way to end the year,
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.200]   the end, the decade.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.200]   I can't imagine a more fun way.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.200]   I thank everybody who sent videos.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.200]   We've run out of time.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.200]   There are many other videos.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.200]   Maybe I'll play a few as we wrap up because so many people
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:29.200]   tweeted their videos and we thank you all for doing so.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.200]   I thank Robert Scobel for being here.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.200]   My old friend, I've known Robert for two decades.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.200]   We're entering our third decade as friends.
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.200]   - Before blogging.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.200]   - Before blogging, that was this thing called the chat room.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:44.200]   And Robert Scobel and I hung out together.
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.200]   It's great to talk to you again.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.200]   Robert Scobelizer.com, of course, is your blog,
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.200]   but don't forget building43.com.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.200]   That's where all the video is going,
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.200]   that Robert's shooting these days.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.200]   And great stuff too.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.200]   Kevin Rose, I've known since he was Mark Zuckerberg's age.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.200]   - 2002, I think, is one of his best friends for a long time.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.200]   - Yeah, a long time.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:05.200]   Now, of course, world famous founder of dig.com
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.200]   and revision3.com and host of Dignation.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.200]   I do have to apologize for beating Dignation out as a best video.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.200]   That was an accident.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.200]   - It's...
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.200]   - I didn't do it on purpose.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.200]   - It's all good.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.200]   We're coming back strong next year.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.200]   - Yeah, you won last year.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.200]   I think it's...
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:23.200]   You know, we got to rotate a little bit.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.200]   - That's right.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.200]   - So this is the family.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.200]   It's all good.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.200]   - It's all in the family.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.200]   That's the point.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.200]   Kevin and Robert have a happy new year.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.200]   I hope you have a wonderful new year's even, new year's day.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.200]   And I look forward to working together with you in 2010 and beyond.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.200]   And I thank all of you, the Twit family,
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.200]   that's made this possible for the last five years.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.200]   Twit was started in 2005, April of 2005.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.200]   And so we really have this decade.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.200]   We span and it's been an amazing decade for all of us at Twit.
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.200]   We just had a blast doing it.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.200]   We're very grateful to you for letting us do this.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.200]   We began the decade with Tech TV.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:03.200]   We're ending the decade with Revision 3 and Twit.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:07.200]   And I really think that's a great way to sum it all up.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.200]   - The viewers that we had on Tech TV, right?
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.200]   - Many, many, between the two of us are you kidding?
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.200]   - Pretty cool.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.200]   - Many, many more, yeah.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.200]   And I think much more interesting stuff too.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.200]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:18.200]   We'll see you next week.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.200]   Happy New Year.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.200]   - That's been a year.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:21.200]   - Another Twit here is in the can.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.200]   Bye bye.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.200]   - Hi, this is Scott Born from Photo Focus.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.200]   The top tech story of the decade, well for me,
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.200]   it's the decade of digital photography.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.200]   Cameras with six times the resolution,
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.200]   $500 cameras with ProCalibur results,
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.200]   post-processing capability that's beyond belief,
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.200]   the ability to shoot and darn near no light,
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.200]   and now cinema quality video,
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.200]   everything from aperture, light room, Photoshop,
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.200]   HDR, panoramic stitching.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:54.200]   It's been a great decade for photography
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.200]   and I can't wait to see what happens next.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:58.200]   See you next time on MacBray.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:00.200]   - Hey everyone, Patrick Begga here,
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.200]   and the most important tech story of the decade,
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.200]   to me, is the issue of net neutrality.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.200]   Now it might seem like it's not a huge problem
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.200]   and it's only come to our attention recently,
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.200]   but I do think that it could redefine the whole internet
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.200]   if it's not handled properly and if we don't pay attention to it,
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:23.200]   so I do think it deserves the spot of number one
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:26.200]   most important tech story of the decade.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.200]   - Hi, this is Dane Gold and Leo's producer here at TWIT.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:32.200]   This week we're talking about the big tech stories of the decade.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.200]   One of those big stories in my opinion has got to include
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.200]   the Googleization of everything because,
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:41.200]   while 10 years ago, Google was just an upstart,
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.200]   most people used Yahoo.
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.200]   Today, Google's involved in everything that we do, almost.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:51.200]   Hey Leo, this is Al Malbantano from PC Perspective.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:54.200]   Best tech news story of the decade, huh?
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:57.200]   Well, I got into it a little bit of a late start there,
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:00.200]   and sort of the technology, but I'd have to say
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.200]   solid state drives, for sure.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200]   That's the one.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.200]   It's led to a whole bunch of tech news stories
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.200]   over the last couple of years, at least, maybe not the whole decade,
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:12.200]   I'm sure it's going to be a hot item in the next decade as well.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.200]   - Hello, my name is Brian Kilby of TF Radio.net.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:17.200]   What's the biggest tech story of the decade?
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.200]   Well, that's easy.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.200]   The proliferation of high speed internet.
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.200]   If it wasn't for that, we wouldn't have all this.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.200]   - Hey Leo, I think without a doubt, the tech story of this decade
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.200]   was the fact that Twitter and Viddly and TWIT Pick
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:34.200]   and all these other great services that allow us to be journalists
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.200]   have essentially democratized the press
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.200]   and put us all on a pretty equal level.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.200]   I mean, you see big time reporters from the major networks using Twitter,
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:46.200]   but you also see people in Iran and in Afghanistan
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.200]   and all these countries where the news is happening,
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.200]   you see them going to the scene and you see them putting their content up
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.200]   for public consumption straight from the event.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:58.200]   And I think that the idea that Twitter and Facebook
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:01.200]   and these other platforms are allowing us to be journalists
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.200]   is an exceptionally interesting trend to watch as it progresses.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.200]   And I know I want to be a journalist when I grew up,
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.200]   preferably in the tech sector, just like yourself.
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.200]   So that's something I'm definitely watching,
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.200]   and I'm hoping it's good to just continue as we move into the next decade.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.200]   So thanks Leo and keep up the great work.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.200]   - Hi Leo.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:26.200]   Best tech story for the decade has to be the 3G iPhone.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.200]   Being that I'm in Canada, I've only had it for two years
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:33.200]   and it is definitely an integral part in everything I do.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.200]   From email to the iPod to the camera,
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:40.200]   I already use it as a phone to the GPS to everything.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:44.200]   This is definitely the biggest tech thing of the decade by far.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.200]   - The biggest tech story in the last decade?
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.200]   Screw you, Arrington!
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.200]   Screw you!
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.200]   (laughter)
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.200]   (music)
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200]   Round the horn.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.200]   All right.
