[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.520]   Boy, what a big week this was.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.320]   Bringing together some of the best tech journalists
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.280]   in the biz to talk about the stories of the day,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.320]   starting with Christina Warren.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.440]   Welcome back, Christina.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.040]   The last time you were on, we actually had to punch you
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.800]   because you just not punch you, punch you.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.760]   Yes, I punted myself because my connection was so bad.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.280]   But this time, I'm wired in, and bad lighting aside.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.040]   I'm happy to be here.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.400]   I'm also very tired.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.000]   You sound good.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.480]   You look at Utah because you were out here
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.880]   and just flew back, right?
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.400]   Senior tech analyst from Mashable.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.080]   You were covering WWDC.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.960]   We're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.600]   Looking forward to that.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.240]   Also here, Ed, my old friend, good friend for many, many years.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.440]   Ed and I were just comparing notes.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.160]   I think I've known him for more than 20 years.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.880]   Ed bot from ZDNet is here, author of the Ed Bot report,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.800]   at Ziff Davis.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.200]   And I've known him since he was editor in chief at--
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.600]   what was it?
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.240]   PC World, Windows, Weekly.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.640]   Windows PC computing.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.840]   PC computing, that's it.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.320]   Editor PC computing before that managing editor of PC World.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.360]   And I think we were doing--
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.840]   whenever John was not able to do his Saturday morning show,
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.720]   I stepped in.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.160]   That's right.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.320]   Off-orack on computers in the early '90s.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.800]   That was--
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.480]   When it was take questions from people,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.920]   should I upgrade to Windows 3.1?
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.560]   This Windows 4 work groups, what does it do?
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.160]   Yeah, it's really--
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.720]   3.11 really better than 3.1 for my business.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.600]   Exactly.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.760]   Actually, I remember from that he were looking at 3.1,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.280]   and thinking, you know what?
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.160]   Because I was a Mac fan.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.040]   I bought a Mac in 1984.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.640]   And 3.0 was not quite it.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.000]   But when I saw 3.1, I said, this is bad for Apple.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.520]   This is Microsoft's caught up.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.520]   And it's been a tough battle ever since.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   We are going to talk a little bit about WWDC, of course,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.880]   in a bit.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.120]   But before we get there, I think more importantly,
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.520]   did you see "Halt and Catch Fire" this week?
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   Yes.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.920]   Did you?
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.360]   Oh, good.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.880]   You're like a show.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.720]   I like that show.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.000]   See, I like it.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.200]   When it first-- in the first five minutes,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.120]   I was telling Lisa, this is horrible.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.840]   I'm so-- because they had a sex scene right away--
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.320]   Right.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.600]   --with the woman who you know is going
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.400]   to be the smartest person on the show.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.440]   Yeah, before the moment.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.840]   And you know--
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.840]   And you know she's going to do whatever--
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.800]   she's going to be the one who says, I'm in.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   Right.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.520]   In some future episode.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.360]   And I had-- Leo, it's funny, because I
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.440]   had the exact same reaction after five minutes.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.040]   I looked over at Judy and I said, this is not grabbing me.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.520]   Yeah, well, I was pissed.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.080]   I felt like, god, this is what-- to me,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.600]   this is exactly what happens when networks get
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.920]   ahold of technology, technical material.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.800]   They don't trust that the audience will be interested,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.600]   so they sex it up.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.400]   Fortunately-- and it's obvious, AMC said, you know,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   can you just start with a sex scene?
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.800]   They got it out of the way.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.520]   And that--
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.920]   And they're great.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.240]   And then the rest of it was great.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.360]   I was really surprised.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.480]   I enjoyed it.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.800]   And they got the font correct.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.880]   What did they get correct?
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.680]   I want to see next weeks.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.320]   I'm not going to say it's great yet.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.760]   I've seen a few episodes.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.680]   I got some screeners.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.200]   And no, the thing that impressed me most--
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.960]   and this was even from the previews that they sent out
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.800]   and some of the trailers, I guess--
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.840]   they got the font correct on the terminal.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.120]   And that was, for me, no, because here's the thing.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.840]   Most people, when they do-- like, especially
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.040]   recreating 80s tech, they don't get that stuff correct.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.120]   And I talked to Christopher Cantwell, who's
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.840]   one of the creators of the show.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.040]   And he actually has a history making 80s looking stuff.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.160]   And his father was actually worked in Texas in the 80s
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.240]   as a computer engineer.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.480]   So he actually grew up in Texas, where his dad did
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.680]   some of the stuff that was similar to Halton Catch Fire.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.840]   And he said that the researchers were very dedicated,
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.680]   and that they made sure that they got the correct font
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.880]   for all the terminal scenes.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.480]   It's funny that you should say that--
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.040]   That's correct.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.800]   I forgot.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.120]   But the IBM PC had a unique font.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.720]   It was designed for IBM.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.640]   And it was a serif font.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.240]   And you're right.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.240]   It was very distinctive.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.560]   And to get that right is critical.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.280]   So I didn't even notice, but they did get that right.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.600]   No, I showed it to my husband, who's
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.320]   like an old school computer nerd.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.440]   And his first computer was an Atari 400.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.920]   Me too.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.640]   And he learned a program that way.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.140]   And whatnot.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.200]   Me too.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.840]   He's very, very particular about making sure
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.720]   that the stuff is correct.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.160]   And he won't even watch a show if it's off.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.080]   And so he was even more critical than I was.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.640]   And he saw the point.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.360]   It was like, OK, cool.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.280]   We can watch this.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.560]   So I don't think it's spoiling.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.280]   And we'll be careful not to spoil anything.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.080]   I don't think there's that much that you could spoil,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.400]   frankly.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.600]   It's not that kind of show.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.200]   But I don't think it spoils anything
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.600]   to say that the plot-- it's a fictionalized story
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.440]   of how the original IBM PC, which came out in 1981,
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.920]   was cloned.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.000]   By Compaq, yeah.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.600]   Well, I don't think it was Compaq.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.240]   You know, I did some research.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.000]   Because the company on the TV show is Cardiff Computer, right?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.480]   Right.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.840]   I mean, they apparently live in a world--
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.200]   Cardiff Electric.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.320]   They apparently live in a world where
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.440]   Compaq still exists.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.760]   But a lot of the stuff--
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.960]   I recently read some book from one of the Compaq co-founders.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.560]   And he actually did an interview with a guy who
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.760]   does the retro internet podcast or something.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.440]   And he talked about what the guys at Compaq
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.920]   rather did to reverse engineer.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.840]   They came out later than-- and I remember this
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.120]   because I had an eagle computer.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.480]   And the first clone was something from--
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.120]   do you remember this?
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.120]   You might remember this.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.120]   Columbia data products.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.240]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.320]   And it was, I believe, Columbia that
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.280]   was the first to do this clean room reverse engineering
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.760]   of the BIOS.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.120]   Right.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.720]   There were definitely earlier people
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.520]   in Compaq, but Compaq was the first one.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.200]   You could get it to work with DOS or with some of this stuff,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.000]   but it wasn't completely--
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.520]   I see.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.760]   So the Columbia--
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.240]   see, they did say the Columbia reverse engineered it.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.120]   But maybe it didn't do-- it wasn't a very--
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.600]   I don't know if it was a perfect-- I don't remember that.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.320]   Are we watching the under 35 readers just--
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.600]   or viewers just like--
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.960]   What are they talking about?
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.600]   Is this before--
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.400]   I'm under 35.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.280]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.520]   But then I'm a weird person.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.280]   Christina Warren is very weird.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.680]   No, this-- remember, the Apple came out in '84.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.080]   The first-- and the Apple II had come out in '77.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.960]   The Apple-- Macintosh came out in '84.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.280]   The first personal computer from IBM, non-Apple,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.680]   you know, this was a big deal, came out in '81.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.200]   One.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.680]   Right.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.000]   '81.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.240]   And the thing that IBM did that was unheard of,
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.640]   they used off-the-shelf parts.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.720]   There were no proprietary parts in it.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.240]   And I think they did this on purpose.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   You were around it and this time period was up.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.160]   Part of the rest, yes.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.360]   And the reason-- oh, I knew all the-- in fact,
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   one of the original members of the IBM PC team
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.400]   used to live across the street where I live right now.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.160]   I moved here nine years ago.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.080]   And for the first five years that I lived here,
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.120]   he was a neighbor of mine.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.960]   So we used to have dinner regularly.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.680]   And we would talk about those early IBM PC days.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.760]   And one reason they used off-the-shelf parts
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.600]   was because they were staying under the radar.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.600]   It was a skunk in Boca Raton.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.160]   They went down to Florida.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.280]   IBM's up in New York.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.800]   Yeah, they were in Armunk, New York.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.320]   And if anybody had known what they were doing down there,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.440]   they probably would have shut them down.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.160]   So it was, in a way, it parallels that first episode
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.680]   of "Haulton Catch Fire," where they were kind of trying
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.720]   to do this in secret and literally in a garage.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.200]   And the IBM guys were trying to get this thing shipped
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.840]   without too many red flags showing up in Armunk.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.400]   Because it makes sense because they
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.760]   would undermine IBM's business, which was mainframe computing.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.120]   And if you put a real computer on somebody's desk,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.560]   that's bad for business.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.000]   Right.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.440]   And from what I understand-- and you guys
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.920]   would know better-- but from what I understand,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.920]   in addition to trying to do it under the radar and prevent IBM
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.400]   from knowing that it was kind of done,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.560]   they were trying to do it as cheaply as possible.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.080]   Right.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.280]   It made sense to use off-the-shelf parts
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.320]   rather than building their own custom ship.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.000]   And then IBM, once they did release it,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.960]   IBM really didn't expect it to be successful,
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.720]   or even want it to be successful.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.920]   And its success kind of was like, well, what do we do now?
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.400]   And then--
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:14.960]   Oh, crap.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.720]   We have to manufacture.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.240]   Right.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.120]   And then all the many computer guys,
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.600]   all the digital equipment core guys,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.560]   everybody else are just like, oh, this is no big deal.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.480]   And then a decade later, none of them,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.880]   including IBM, are making computers.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.680]   Did you know Don Estrich by any chance, Ed?
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.880]   I had met him.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.800]   He passed away just a few years later in a plane crash.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.960]   But he led the Boca Raton team that built this.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.720]   And they not only used off-the-shelf parts,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.680]   but they documented the one proprietary part.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.720]   In fact, it's so funny because they're scanning the board,
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   looking for the proprietary part.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   They buy an IBM PC in the show.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.120]   And they're scanning-- somewhere in here, there's a--
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.280]   yes, the one with a big copyright IBM.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.400]   You could see it even--
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.480]   so yeah, that's the part.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.160]   It was an 8K ROM chip, the basic input-output system
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.120]   that IBM wrote.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.720]   But they even, in their manuals, documented all the calls.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.840]   So IBM was really open about this in a way
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.000]   that you wouldn't expect an IBM to be even in those days.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.360]   Yeah, shockingly.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:22.800]   Now--
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.880]   They got they were, but I'm sure they regretted it afterwards.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.040]   Well, maybe because, yeah, the clones came--
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.560]   I had an Eagle, which was never reliable.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.440]   It was one of the early predated compact--
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.600]   One of the early clones.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.520]   A leading edge.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.400]   Leading edge, remember that?
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.320]   Yep, yep.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.080]   Hyundai, I think it was Hyundai who made those.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.640]   The reason the Eagle was cool, the IBM 8088
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.560]   went at 4.77 megahertz.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.400]   The Eagle, I think, was at nine.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.040]   Dude, that's fast at nine.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.120]   That was like eight or nine.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.960]   It's like, oh, it's twice as fast.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.280]   But it never was reliable.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.160]   So it's a trade-off a little bit.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.960]   But Ed, do you remember--
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.800]   And this is one thing I wasn't sure about.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.520]   Maybe, Christina, you know.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.280]   The way they do it in the TV show
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.480]   is, looks kind of a little bogus.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.440]   They have an oscilloscope, and they test the leads,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.240]   and they've set up some kind of goofy LED readout,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.880]   and they're writing down hex code.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.840]   I gather, I guess, what they were doing
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.560]   is looking at each memory location in the ROM chip
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.440]   and writing down its hex code.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   Is that how you would do this?
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.600]   That's how you would--
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.040]   Seems like you would dump the chip.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.120]   They were basically disassembling it.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.640]   Well, what would you dump it into?
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.880]   I guess.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.600]   I mean, all you need is a chip reader
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   that would just do this, I think you could have,
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.920]   even in those days, just read the chip.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   It's ROM code, unless it was somehow encrypted.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.200]   But that was--
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.520]   We were talking about this.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.200]   My wife and I, as we were watching it,
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.480]   was that as he's writing this down in this notebook,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.320]   how many of these are there?
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.960]   65,536.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.640]   And he goes, OK.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.480]   And he's writing them down in this notebook,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.000]   and we're saying, if only he had a personal computer.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.880]   Be so easy.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.120]   I think even in those days, you could get a ROM reader
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.200]   that would give you.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.520]   So then you get the hex code, and now you disassemble it.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.240]   But now you've got a problem, because the engineers who
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.400]   do that now know the code.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.440]   They are contaminated.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.680]   They're contaminated.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.840]   You go back to a decision just the year before--
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.880]   actually, it may have come down that year--
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.480]   between Apple and a company called Franklin Computer.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.160]   Remember this?
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.520]   The Franklin Ace was a clone of the Apple II.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.680]   And Apple sued them saying, but wait a minute,
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.080]   your ROM code is stolen.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.000]   It's exactly the same as our proprietary code.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.040]   The first court that heard it, the argument Franklin made,
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.800]   was, well, it's not human readable.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.960]   So you can't copyright it.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.160]   You can only copyright something that a human can read.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.280]   The first court said, yeah, you're right, Franklin.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.520]   But they went on to Circuit Court.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.640]   The Circuit Court reviewed it and said, no, no.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.120]   You could still copyright own machine readable code.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.360]   That decision held-- and Apple was
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.960]   able to put Franklin out of business.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.840]   So the folks, whoever it was, Cardiff, Columbia, Eagle,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.480]   Compact, that were reverse engineering the code,
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.880]   knew already what the law held.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.280]   You cannot copy the code.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.720]   It's copyrighted.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.480]   So what do you do?
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:29.040]   So you take the APIs or take the functional description
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.680]   of the output of the machine, and you literally reverse
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.720]   engineer it.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.640]   You say, what does it take to take input and turn it
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.200]   into this output?
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.080]   And if the output is documented well enough,
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.640]   you can engineer the part in the middle.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.160]   And where this show, I think, is going to go
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.120]   is about how you can get it 90, 95% right.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.960]   But then you discover the places where
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.080]   you reverse engineer the right result for the one thing
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.440]   that you knew, but then something else happens
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.480]   and it behaves differently.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.400]   Undocumented APIs and odd behavior, maybe buggy,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.080]   even behavior.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   You have to duplicate the bugs.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.600]   You have to duplicate the bugs.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.560]   In the code.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.120]   Don't you duplicate the accurate code.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.080]   You have to duplicate the bugs as well.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.280]   And I mean, this is in silicon.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   Right.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.000]   There's a book by Rod Kanlon, who
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.600]   is one of the founders of Compaq called Open, How Compaq
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.760]   ended IBM's PC Domination and helped
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.120]   reinvent the modern computer.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.360]   And I read that on the plane, actually,
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.040]   on the way to WWDC.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.080]   It's a really good read.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.200]   And he goes into the whole story about what
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.600]   they did to reverse engineer.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.360]   And White rumor, reverse engineer, the bios,
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.120]   and the whole configuration.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.760]   And what made Compaq unique, as you said,
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.320]   they weren't the first clone, but they
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.000]   were the first one who made it fully compatible with the software.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.800]   And beyond that, they were more compatible than future
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.920]   IBM's were with older software.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.320]   And that was funny.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:57.680]   Right.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.520]   And so that was actually how they were able to outsell IBM.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.520]   That and the fact that they went to the 386 first.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.240]   You know, IBM--
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:05.720]   I remember that.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   --catch wanting to do.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.680]   The second one was 286.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.800]   And they didn't want to move to the 386.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.640]   And Compaq saw, as Microsoft did, that, hey, this
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.840]   is going to be the chip.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.920]   And so they had the 386 first.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.120]   And so that was basically how they became.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.640]   So you've seen more than we have.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.760]   You've seen more than we have.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.880]   You actually got some screeners.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.000]   You've seen how many episodes have you seen?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.360]   Three.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.680]   Does it get good?
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.480]   I mean, are you record--
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.400]   Yeah, I mean, I really like the show.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.280]   I mean, you know, but I'm somebody
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.880]   who's a total nerd about retro computer history.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.640]   But I also feel like they're doing a good job
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.120]   at the characters and things like that.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.480]   But I like the show.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.800]   It feels like AMC said, all right, mad men's over.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.160]   What are we going to do?
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.640]   Totally.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.140]   Totally.
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.960]   They're like, OK, mad men with computers.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.480]   But--
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.400]   Even this guy is like Don Draper.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.240]   This says--
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.400]   Oh, completely, completely.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.320]   It's funny because they've got the more difficult thing.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.920]   And I was talking to one of the co-creators about this,
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.400]   is that how do you show how people program
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.840]   or how they reverse engineer things or whatnot.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   Right.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.680]   So boring.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:07.700]   It is.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.000]   And so that becomes a really interesting creative challenge.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.800]   And the social network did it really, really well.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.080]   I thought so.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.120]   They did probably the best of any of any--
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.040]   Writing the code on the window.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.080]   I loved that.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.880]   And you know that's not exactly how it works,
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.320]   but that can really visualize experience
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.680]   rather than just somebody who is in front of typing,
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.440]   because you don't want to see that.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.800]   And I would say that probably that's the best representation.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.280]   And actually, War Games, which also just celebrated,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.000]   it's a 30th anniversary or 31st anniversary, I guess it was.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.960]   Yeah, I was playing an AP.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.680]   Exactly.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.360]   Yeah, that just turned 31.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   You know, did a really good job of showing that sort of,
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.200]   you know, how computers work sort of thing.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.640]   I interviewed John Badum, the director on the screen savers
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.440]   some years ago.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.080]   And he had brought a photo album of War Games.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.760]   It was so fun to see.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.760]   Wow.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.280]   And what's interesting about Badum and the director--
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.440]   is it was a did Fincher Direct--
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.240]   Social Network.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.520]   --is that they both cared a lot about the technology
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.440]   and even though it was kind of behind the scenes,
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.560]   they wanted to get it right.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.160]   There was a scene in the Social Network,
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.520]   you may remember, in class at Harvard, Mark Zuckerberg walks in
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.080]   and Professor Poses a very challenging question.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.560]   Nobody can get it.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.040]   Zuckerberg in the back of the class stands up and says, well,
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.200]   they shot the whole scene and the technical expert who
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.320]   was on set to advise them said, you know, that's wrong.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.760]   And they said, well, Fincher said, well, what's wrong?
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.120]   And he said, well, it should say this, this,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   and they reshot it.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.560]   They did it because they wanted to be right.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.160]   I knew talking to the Halton-Ketch fire creator,
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.920]   he said that when they were working with the technology,
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.680]   A, they had to make sure that they sourced all the stuff that
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.000]   was of that era.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.160]   But B, they worked with experts to make sure
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.800]   that the actors were holding them correctly
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.880]   and were using them correctly.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.320]   Because it was really important to them
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.600]   to make sure, like, for instance--
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.040]   and again, this doesn't ruin anything,
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.480]   but in the opening-- in the first episode,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.320]   the wife is taking a part of speak and spell.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.640]   And they wanted to make sure that she was holding it
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.280]   and holding the tools the right way.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.080]   And they did that across the board with the series,
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.400]   because they really wanted to make sure
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.920]   that they got those details correct.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.080]   And is it feelable weird now?
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.880]   This is not for you, Christina, but it feels a little weird.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.960]   As somebody, both of us are old enough to actually
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.400]   lived that era, and we're covering technology in that era,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.200]   and we're writing about this stuff,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:37.040]   it feels a little weird that that's now ancient history
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.040]   for people.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.040]   Did it feel that way?
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.640]   I mean, I dressed like that.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   I had the side, Brian, the clothes, the music.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.720]   To me, I was telling you this, that was just the other day.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   I remember that quite well.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.680]   That was right before I went into tech.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.600]   So I was in the publishing industry then,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.440]   and I was working with consumer electronics
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:04.320]   and social-- it was a men's magazine
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.600]   that I was working for at the time.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.360]   What men's magazine were you working for?
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.760]   I was working for Playboy.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   You're kidding.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.080]   Awesome.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.600]   I did.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   Yes.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.560]   Did you do technology?
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.560]   What did you consider electronics for Playboy?
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.000]   Were you the stereo guy?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.640]   For the young men's version, because I was only 22 or 23
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:30.680]   at the time, I did stereos desktop and car stereos.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.520]   And I think the first Walkman came out a couple years later
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.080]   than that, and I covered some of those,
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.000]   and all sorts of little gadgetry.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.560]   And the first Atari computers came out then as well.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.520]   And I remember doing an article about how to--
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.440]   for a young man's audience--
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.360]   and this is relevant, having just completed the Triple Crown--
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.600]   the handicapping horse races on a computer.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.680]   And you type it in in Q basic.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   Great.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.760]   Oh, well, you know, I mean, I can look back on it.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.600]   I think I still have some actual typed--
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.000]   and typed them on a damn select trick.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Right.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.920]   From the center to someone who then typed them
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.000]   into a lineotype machine.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.800]   And so you--
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.480]   I'm going to get one character wrong.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.000]   Right.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.520]   Right.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:20.520]   Right.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.760]   Now, I have some old--
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.400]   I collect retro computer magazines,
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.320]   and I have some old ones that have pages and pages of code.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   You know, there's--
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   Christina, I love your professor.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.880]   You are in the club.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.240]   You join the club.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:32.740]   Holy--
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.720]   I hear you with two old men who actually were there.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.560]   And you're still-- and you collect this stuff.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   I wrote for "Bite" and "Info World" in the mid '80s wrote--
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.380]   I mean, I wrote about Atari for "Bite" and "Info World"
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.260]   wrote about the first Macintosh for "Bite."
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.920]   But see, it didn't seem--
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.880]   it's not-- it's 30 years ago now.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.680]   It didn't seem--
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.480]   Doesn't feel like 30 years.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.640]   It doesn't feel that long.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.160]   Anyway, you'll see in about 30 years, Christina.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.720]   You'll look back at this, and you go,
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.880]   god, that doesn't seem so long ago I was on Twitch.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.060]   I would be staggered to imagine what things are going
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.140]   to be like in 30 years.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:05.940]   Can you imagine?
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.100]   Because the curve--
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.180]   The acceleration of change in that 30 years
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.620]   is hockey stick.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.060]   Absolutely.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.860]   And so I think it's possible that in five years,
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.820]   our world will be as different as it is compared to 30 years
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.860]   ago today.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.740]   That's how fast things are changing.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:33.440]   And that's how fast we have to be willing to adapt to that change.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.740]   Adapt or just--
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.500]   Adapt or die.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.740]   --going over.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.160]   I'm waiting for that data to come.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.580]   But so far, I've been able to keep up.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.780]   And I love it.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.160]   Well, I was going to say, that's why you guys are so great.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.900]   Because so many people-- and it's not just
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.900]   in tech, but in other industries-- as things progress,
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.140]   they don't keep up to date with what's happening.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.140]   We've fossilized.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.780]   I personally think it's awesome that you guys
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.620]   were around at the beginning and are still on top of it
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.300]   and are covering things now.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.900]   Because that gives you context that people like me--
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.700]   I only have it from reading stuff and being a fan as a kid.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.700]   But you have the real context and the real knowledge of, hey,
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.420]   this is how far we've progressed.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.220]   And that's so useful, I think.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:15.020]   I'm really feeling it.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:15.980]   We'll get Jerry Purnell on the next--
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.820]   I'm not trying to make it go on.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.420]   I'm just saying that.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.340]   You know what, the next time you're
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.780]   going to Jerry Purnell will join us,
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.700]   and we'll really have it all the time.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.980]   Because then he was like, Mr. Bite, right?
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.660]   Right.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.700]   Chaos Corn, Garth Manor, yeah.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.660]   Oh my god, every month, get--
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.820]   Love, Bite, Augustine.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.340]   Love, Bite.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.980]   And go, holy crap, how many words did Jerry Purnell
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.300]   write this month?
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.220]   He just--
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.220]   He just loved Jerry.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.700]   He was the Stephen King of tech in many ways.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.540]   He really was something else.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.620]   Loved him.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.380]   Love him, still.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.100]   And he's been on 28 times.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.060]   And he's still around.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.460]   In fact, Chad, that reminds me.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.300]   We're due to have Jerry back on Twitter soon.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.340]   Let's get him back on Twitter.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:52.940]   Let's take a break.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:53.220]   We'll come back.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.420]   We have lots of news to talk about.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.820]   WWDC, I think the love fest may end in a moment.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.820]   Well, we'll--
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.140]   There is other history, too.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.980]   This is the 30th anniversary of Tetris.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.220]   We could talk about that.
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.860]   And what is that thing that Amazon is going to announce
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.460]   June 18?
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.100]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.220]   But first a word from our friends at Squarespace,
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.340]   the all-in-one platform makes it very easy
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.860]   to create your own professional website, your portfolio,
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.140]   or do e-commerce.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.100]   Squarespace is everything you need.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.060]   It's the best hosting you can get.
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.940]   We try every time I do a Squarespace app.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.220]   We try to bring the Squarespace sites down.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.840]   Everybody go to inside.twit.tv, our blog,
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.420]   and try to bring it.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.940]   You cannot bring it down.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.220]   Because the software that's running on the site
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.700]   is so tightly integrated with the hosting software
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.100]   that the minute more bandwidth is needed, it's provided.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.300]   It is an amazing technological design.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.580]   We've been with Squarespace.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.020]   It's almost the very beginning of the days
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.900]   that they came out of the college dorm room.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.820]   And I still think every time I see it,
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.860]   gosh, it's better and better and better and better.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.380]   New features, new designs, better support.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.580]   They support all coming from the Squarespace offices
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.500]   in New York.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.420]   You're talking to knowledgeable support people who actually
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.620]   work with the software, work with the designs, the templates.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.500]   It all starts off at the Squarespace site.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.060]   You'll see a big get-- oh, that's cool.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.300]   Did you see that parallax effect?
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.100]   Wow, as you move your mouse around?
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.020]   That's built in.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.380]   Little CSS magic there.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.820]   The neat thing about Squarespace,
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.140]   you don't have to know CSS or JavaScript or HTML.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.260]   You use their software.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.140]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.060]   Start by clicking the get started button.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.300]   You'll be choosing from 25 gorgeous designer templates.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.260]   But I have to tell you, it's not just how gorgeous
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.340]   the template is.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.500]   It's what is going on behind the scenes.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.380]   It's actually quite sophisticated.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.420]   This is very modern web design, as an example,
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.660]   mobile responsive.
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.300]   So it looks good on any size screen.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.940]   In fact, when you upload a picture to your Squarespace site,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.420]   they automatically size nine different versions of it.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.060]   So they can serve the version that's
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.820]   right for the screen, whether it's a four inch iPhone
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.020]   or a 30 inch QHD display.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.140]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.260]   They always look good.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.020]   But don't think because I'm starting you with a template,
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.540]   you're going to be look like 25 other sites.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.420]   Every site's unique.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.620]   You'll see these are all using the template that I selected.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.460]   Each one has its own unique feel and look.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.500]   They're very visual because today that's
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.820]   what consumers want.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.940]   They're great for a photographer and an artist
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.700]   because they'll reflect your style.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.260]   You know, you completely can customize it, drag and drop.
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:33.580]   Add widgets to do social media, whatever you want to have in there.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.700]   Metrics, SEO, everything's done so beautifully.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.860]   And yes, they have e-commerce.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.620]   The best e-commerce I've ever seen.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.220]   This is a perfect example of Squarespace.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.700]   Didn't have e-commerce for a long time
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.460]   because they wanted to get it right when they introduced it
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.660]   last year, it was easily the best e-commerce solution anywhere.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.220]   Let me take you through the pricing, too.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.980]   Now, you're going to be able to try it for two weeks
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.020]   without a credit card.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.540]   That means you could try everything.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.220]   You can even import your existing content
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.620]   from any other blog API and write in there.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.700]   So you can see the comments.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.420]   You can see the images.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.580]   You can see what it would look like.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.460]   Change the template.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.900]   They're not integrated.
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.340]   They're not wired together.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.260]   The content and the style and design are completely separate.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.740]   So it's very easy to try all the different designs.
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.020]   As little as $8 a month with the annual plan,
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.740]   that will give you a domain name registration.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.780]   You can even do e-commerce on the $8 a month plan.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.580]   One product, or you could accept donations
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.300]   great for a wedding register, cash registry, or a nonprofit.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.220]   The professional site, unlimited pages, galleries, blogs,
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.340]   unlimited bandwidth.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.340]   And then if you really want to do the e-commerce,
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.140]   you've got to take a look at the business plan.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.140]   $24 a month.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.620]   You get real-time carrier shipping.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.220]   You get label printing.
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.020]   You get integrated inventory and accounting.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.620]   They set up the credit card for you.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.940]   So if you don't have a merchant account,
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.100]   they'll help you with that going through Stripe.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.980]   And all of this, they don't take a cut of your business.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.060]   All of this $24 a month.
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.820]   I think Squarespace is really amazing.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.260]   I want you to try it today.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.540]   All you have to do is visit squarespace.com.

[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.740]   You don't need to give them a credit card,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.660]   or even our offer code.

[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.820]   The secret behind some of the most beautiful websites,
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.380]   the most modern websites in the world.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.860]   WWDC was this week.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.340]   Christina, you came out for WWDC?
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.220]   I sure did.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:24.740]   I sure did.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.180]   And I was very fortunate that I got to attend the session.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.780]   So I won the lottery.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.660]   So I got to the lottery they had for attendees.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.820]   So I was able to attend sessions and really
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.860]   get more of an idea of what some of the new stuff was
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.700]   that they know.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.700]   That's something new because in the past,
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.580]   journalists were able to go to the keynote,
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.580]   but then they kicked us all out.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.380]   Right, right.
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.140]   And they did actually let some journalists
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.380]   get developer badges.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.260]   In this case, I'm a registered Apple developer.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.340]   So I won the keynote in that respect and I paid for my badge.
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.500]   But what was different was that they lifted the NDA
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.380]   on discussing who was in the sessions.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.180]   See, that's where you would be at a disadvantage
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.380]   because you don't want to be a developer
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.980]   because you could go in there and you maybe know everything,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.300]   but you can't say a word.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:07.700]   Right.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.900]   So you still can't put up screenshots
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.660]   and you still, they don't want full reviews of stuff,
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.900]   but we could talk about everything that they announced,
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.100]   you know, the APIs and whatnot, which is frankly,
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.140]   it's about time because so many developers have felt,
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.300]   I think, encumbered and afraid to, OK,
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.660]   how do we talk about this stuff now?
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.380]   You know, because they announced so much stuff,
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.220]   I mean, they announced so much stuff
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.300]   that I think they try to keep it all under wraps
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.820]   until the fall would be A, it would be
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.540]   untenable, everybody breaks in D.A. anyway,
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.540]   but B, it really wouldn't be good for the developer ecosystem
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.380]   as a whole.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.780]   Did you, you didn't go ahead?
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.260]   You know, my ticket never arrived.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.780]   It's a little known as a Windows guy, I'm afraid.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.780]   Oh, you were a build though, right?
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.620]   So, you know.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:52.740]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.260]   I was a build and in fact, John Gruber did an episode
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.620]   of the talk show with me.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.180]   We at Build, we did a live--
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.260]   Wow, good for John.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.980]   --on one discussion.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.180]   It was so much fun and it was so interesting.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.540]   And it really, I think, a few heads exploded over that.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.700]   But the reality is that Mr. Gruber and I
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.740]   have a tremendous amount in common.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.500]   We both love technology.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.620]   We both happen to be experts on the platforms
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:29.300]   that we've spent time serving the users and developers of.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.700]   But that doesn't mean that we're somehow
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.980]   agents of those platforms.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.420]   We just happen to be experts in them
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:43.060]   and advocates for the people who use them.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.700]   And so we had a lot in common and it
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.500]   was a tremendous conversation that we had there.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.900]   And he made a joke at the end.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.660]   I've got to get you to WWDC.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.620]   And maybe next year, because I did watch--
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.860]   I watched the entire keynote.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.740]   Made a few snarky comments on Twitter.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:05.940]   But overall, I was quite impressed with a lot of what I saw.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.860]   Not all the jokes.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.860]   Yeah, some of which were Windows expense.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.620]   And so I would understand why you made it.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.700]   It wasn't even that.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.700]   There was only, I think, one joke about Windows.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.740]   There was a lot of anti-Google stuff there.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.740]   It was very-- in fact, that was, I think,
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.740]   one of the big themes, among the big takeaways of everything
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:33.660]   from WWDC for me, was that Apple has said,
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.940]   quite clearly, what the things that it's doing here.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.260]   First of all, we want to make it,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:43.020]   if you are fully invested in the Apple platform, Mac, iPad,
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.380]   iPhone, and all the apps and services that pertain there,
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.220]   too, we're going to make your experience as good as possible.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.420]   The more of our stuff you buy, the better your experience
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.500]   is going to be.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.860]   But the other thing that they've done
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.260]   is to open things up, both in terms of apps,
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.580]   but in terms of services.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.780]   So there's a lot of synergy now between Microsoft and Apple.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:11.380]   And it's almost like, despite the one pie chart up there,
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.780]   there was a great deal of respect and synergy
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.500]   between Apple and Microsoft products.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.140]   And there was literally no respect or synergy
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:30.340]   between OS X and iOS and their counterparts, Android and Chrome.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.940]   Christina, did you get that takeaway?
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.460]   Completely.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.900]   I mean, it was very clear.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.100]   I mean, and it makes sense, too, right?
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.380]   Because John Gruber, as you mentioned earlier,
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.540]   his app, that's what he does with Brent Simmons
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.540]   and with Dave Whiskis, the new sync that was just released,
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.300]   is built on Azure.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.580]   And I mean, I caught itself as an Azure.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.580]   Can you confirm that?
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.940]   Because that's been said for a long time,
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.860]   but we've never confirmed it.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.740]   I can confirm that.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.700]   I can confirm that.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.180]   I'll just say, source is close to Apple.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.020]   Very interesting.
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.820]   Yeah, because neither side, neither Microsoft nor Apple
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.060]   has ever said officially.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.780]   But Azure, which is Microsoft's cloud platform,
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.500]   powers Apple's cloud platform, my cloud.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.540]   Right.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.460]   But it was also interesting that they were almost going out
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.100]   of their way to, as Ed said, very much make it
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.820]   so that if you're a full Apple person, like I am,
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.540]   for my personal use, everything works together better.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.580]   But also, the underlying thing was almost to say,
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.300]   we can take Google out of the equation as much as possible.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.460]   So that comes with some of their search stuff
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.660]   of Spotlight and how it'll search other parts of the web, too.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.820]   That comes with adding these extensions
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.340]   and adding these additional features
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.140]   that it's not so much because users and developers
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.980]   want to need them, because they do.
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.860]   But it's about, OK, well, this might convince you
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.540]   to no longer use Chrome or this might convince you
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.140]   to not switch to Android.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.820]   And I thought that was really interesting.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.980]   Even it's like the iCloud Drive that people
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.020]   have been wanting for ages, it almost
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.860]   seems more of a response not to Dropbox so much.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.460]   But so Google Drive and wanting to keep people
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:09.420]   from migrating to the new enemy, which is Google.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.220]   Yeah, it's interesting how both Apple and Microsoft
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.860]   are now aligned.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:15.860]   Right.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.860]   And the new access, a new alliance against Google.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:23.620]   But what I do like is it seems as if both companies are saying,
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.540]   we will provide an alternative for people who
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.900]   want Google-like services but don't
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.500]   want to give Google all that information.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:30.940]   And that's--
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.460]   Definitely.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.340]   At least from a marketing point of view,
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.140]   I'm not going to speak technically.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.380]   But from a marketing point of view,
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.060]   that's a good position to take.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.860]   No, I mean, and it comes out of very advantageous time,
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.380]   because people care about that more than they did a year ago.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.380]   It was just a year ago this time that this Snowden stuff
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.260]   started leaked.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.980]   And I think that in a different universe where
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.100]   we didn't have all this new stuff and the paranoia
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.380]   around privacy and security was so high,
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.900]   that the fact that you have to give certain things up,
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.820]   namely aggregation of your data to get these access
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.140]   to these services, most people were more than willing
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.100]   to make the trade off.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.620]   And I think that still most people
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.060]   are willing to make the trade off.
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.340]   But in that climate and with this increased conversation,
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.460]   there is a real opportunity from a marketing standpoint,
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.460]   whether or not it's true technically or not.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.460]   Well, that's my question.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.140]   It's a good alternative.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:25.180]   Can you say that it is more private, safer,
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.140]   to use Microsoft or Apple than it is Google?
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.700]   I don't know if you can say it's safer.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.180]   I think that you can say it's more private only
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.460]   and so far as they are not selling services and paying
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.660]   for things based on what your data sets.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.620]   Well, they make their money in hardware in the case
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.660]   of Apple and the hardware software in case of Microsoft.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.980]   But they do-- Apple has iAds, Microsoft sells ads.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.060]   Of course, of course.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.980]   And that becomes the big question,
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.020]   is to say, OK, they are taking this data.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.900]   Are they storing it?
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.660]   And are they manipulating it in other ways?
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.660]   Because I think that would be the big question.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.300]   From what I understand and what I've seen,
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.740]   I don't think that they are.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.180]   But it doesn't negate the possibility
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.380]   that they could at some point switch things around and say,
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.180]   now we want to do more of what Google's doing,
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.300]   which is offering you a more custom experience based
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.060]   on the data we have on you.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.420]   I mean, but that's the thing that--
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.940]   That's one advantage to giving Google that information.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.260]   Yes, it is.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.780]   They could do things like Google Now and say, hey,
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.020]   I know you're looking for pants.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.860]   You're passing a pants store with a sale right now.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.820]   Apple would never do that.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.060]   Microsoft would never do that.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:26.420]   No.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.100]   And I think that Google is a little bit ahead on that.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.660]   I think that that is a very great--
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.460]   that's an awesome feature of Google Now.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.780]   But what's really, really--
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.860]   it's creepy, though, because right now, anyway,
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.380]   to me, Google Now is creepy because I don't enable it.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.540]   If I enabled it and said specifically, I want this to work,
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.700]   then I would feel better about it.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.700]   But the fact that it's just on, that serendipity thing
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.460]   that might be awesome and is quite frankly,
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.180]   really probably the direction we're all moving in
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.900]   in terms of privacy and how things work.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:00.500]   Because we're not at that place--
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.900]   Apple will get to a point where-- and maybe Microsoft
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.220]   too-- where it wishes it did have that data.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.340]   Yeah, at that point--
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.380]   OK, good.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.180]   So you said-- Christina says, no, and Ed says yes.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.900]   So go ahead, Christina.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.740]   Or do you want to let Ed-- you want to think about that?
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.620]   I just wanted-- I wanted to go on Ed.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:24.100]   Well, so Google's revenue--
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.740]   once the Motorola deal closes to Lenovo,
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:32.020]   Google will be back to making 90% of their revenue
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:37.060]   from information that they gather from their customers
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.740]   and sell it to other people.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:44.540]   It is literally their revenue stream is information.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.540]   Apple's revenue stream is hardware, software, and services.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.500]   They have displayed consistency through the years
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.140]   about taking information that they gather about their customers,
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.660]   credit card numbers, and so forth,
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.780]   and using those to make those experiences better.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:07.180]   Microsoft tried to compete with Google in the advertising realm
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:11.420]   with the acquisition of a quantitative back in 2007.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.940]   That acquisition ended up writing off for billions of dollars.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.340]   They wrote off $6 billion.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.340]   They wrote off one third of a WhatsApp on that.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.380]   And I think--
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.860]   Half of us have--
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:30.220]   And I know from doing the reporting during that time
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:34.900]   that there was a great deal of fighting within Microsoft
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.420]   over, this is not us.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.940]   We should not be doing this.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.580]   And it was-- well, let's see.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.300]   If this is the future of the internet,
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.780]   then we need to be here.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.900]   And they tried to do it, and they couldn't succeed.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:52.580]   And so they said, let's exit the dark side.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.660]   They still sell ads because advertising
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.380]   drives the modern internet.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.420]   You can't be a player in the modern internet,
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.180]   even Apple, even Microsoft.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.380]   If they still sell ads, then it's just a matter of degree.
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.580]   It's not that they're not collecting information.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.420]   No.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.420]   No.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.420]   Well, no.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.420]   Go on, Ed.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:17.540]   If your goal is to gather as much information
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.620]   about your customers as possible and put it into databases
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.620]   and allow those databases to become as large as possible
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:30.820]   because that is your product, then that's different from,
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.740]   let's collect information to help us serve more effective ads
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:40.220]   and throw it away and not exploit it in the future.
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.460]   Those really are pretty bright lines that
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.980]   are pretty far apart.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.780]   So you say Google is not merely collecting information
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.820]   to show ads, but they're saving it for some future use?
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.300]   Absolutely.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.900]   I think that's without question.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.100]   I mean, that's one of the reasons why they are so successful
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.500]   right now is that they've been taking our information,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.900]   our searches, our destinations, our activities.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.660]   And that's why Google now works.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.420]   They claim that's to improve search results.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.620]   Well, and it does.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.620]   And it certainly does.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.980]   But at the same time, something like Google now
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:16.420]   would not work if you didn't have this backlog going back
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.660]   a decade of information.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.420]   Well, and then my question, aren't consumers
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.940]   going to want Google now like features?
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.060]   And won't Microsoft and Apple be hobbled
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.460]   but by the fact that they haven't been saving this information?
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.380]   Yes.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.380]   And that's what I agree with.
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.700]   I think that no question at some point
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.700]   that will probably become the expectation.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.580]   But I think the big key difference--
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.060]   and this is what I think Ed is saying--
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.620]   is that Google also-- it's not just
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.900]   that Google uses that information.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.940]   It's that they also sell that information.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.180]   However, it's anonymized.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.740]   But your still information about you
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.180]   is then sold to other people.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.980]   And I think that's the disconnect
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   where ads that AI ad is not a very successful product, first
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.300]   of all.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.740]   But it doesn't mean they didn't try.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.940]   It just means they didn't succeed.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.420]   No, of course they did.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.900]   They didn't try very hard.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.500]   I mean, if they did try hard, then wow.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.060]   Because that was--
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.340]   Again, it seems a matter of degree--
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.340]   Yes.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:05.980]   --in 10.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.860]   But sure.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.660]   But I think that it's one of those things where
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.940]   you can sell ads without making the user database
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.980]   information available.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.660]   And whether you can be successful, obviously you can't.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.660]   But they have a lot of information.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.020]   Well, Google would say we don't give personal information
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.220]   about Christina Warren and Ed Bot to anybody.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.900]   We sell it in aggregate, as does Facebook.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:23.500]   Right.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.540]   I mean, except for the things like the plus ones
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.020]   and some of the other information.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.260]   You might not be able to identify it directly
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.940]   with a person, but all of your information for your profile
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.460]   is linked together and sold to an advertiser, which to some people
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.620]   is so creepy.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.340]   So I think that Google's core business
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.700]   is all about advertising and targeted advertising.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:42.940]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.020]   But that's their core model.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.700]   So as much data as possible and making
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   that available to as many people as possible
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.900]   and getting as many people as possible to use their products
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:50.780]   is their business line.
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.740]   Whereas Microsoft and Apple, obviously,
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.620]   they might be able to use that stuff internally.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.340]   But they don't make it accessible externally
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.460]   to other companies.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.140]   And that's because they have other legs, so to speak,
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:03.980]   on their chair.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.500]   Right.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.340]   They can sell software, they can sell services.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.940]   In the case of Apple hardware.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.180]   And I think the big difference is the one
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.300]   is primarily an ad information company.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.980]   And the others, it's an ad hoc thing.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.380]   And if they are going to use that customized information,
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.740]   it's what they are using.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.900]   And it's not something that they could make available
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.380]   to a third party, so the third party could use it.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.060]   I'm a Google fan, and I like Google now,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.540]   and I don't care what Google knows about me.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.700]   But I do think that this is a very great position to be in one
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.140]   respect for both Apple and Microsoft,
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.580]   because you now provide an alternative to people
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.260]   who are discomfited by what Google does.
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.140]   No, I think absolutely.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.380]   Google is essentially to the private sector.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.100]   And I am not trolling here, I promise.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:55.180]   Google is to the private sector what the NSA is to government
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.180]   information.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:00.020]   They're the NSA without jails and tanks.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.420]   The NSA doesn't have jails and tanks either.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.380]   The NSA is signals collection.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.020]   I understand, but they act as an agency of information
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.380]   for people who do have jails and tanks.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.500]   And Google owns double click.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.820]   And worst Google can do is advertise to you.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.660]   They're not going to arrest you.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.020]   No, but it's-- well, except they have information
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.940]   that they turn over to the police as well, which--
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.260]   But so does Apple and Microsoft?
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.060]   Absolutely they do, absolutely.
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.340]   None of these companies are successful as much as they
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.780]   might try in keeping the government's hands off
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.900]   of this information.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:33.900]   I completely agree.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.100]   I think the difference is just the level--
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.660]   That's trained left the station longer ago.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:37.500]   Absolutely did.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.740]   No, I would argue that that's--
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.140]   I would agree that that's a big issue of privacy issue.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.300]   I would argue that's one we should be concerned about.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.020]   But no company gets away with that.
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.020]   There's nobody saying no to the NSA.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.380]   Oh, you're-- no, there's a--
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.740]   I'm not-- but there's no question.
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.500]   Everybody's complicit.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.340]   But when you have so much more information,
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.260]   I think that's where it changes so much.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.860]   Where's Google knows more about me than anybody?
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.860]   I type in G--
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.260]   No, you know who knows more about you?
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.460]   You're internet service provider.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.340]   Should they choose to collect that information?
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.220]   And most do on behalf of the government.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.860]   They know a lot more about you because they know everything
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.380]   you do as opposed to Google, which only knows
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.140]   what Google thinks you do.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.060]   Well, what's interesting, Leo, is we--
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.020]   and we have this every time I'm on.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:18.500]   I know.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.300]   Eventually, we get around to this--
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.900]   Well, I just wanted to defend this side of it.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.220]   Because I agree--
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:23.700]   I agree.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.380]   All of these positions are completely legitimate.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.180]   I don't mean to dismiss your position at all.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.660]   It's the thing.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:34.460]   Google is actually a small part of an industry that's even
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:39.140]   larger, which is the data aggregation industry, which
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.100]   is dominated.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.500]   There's companies out there whose names you have never
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.540]   heard before.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.140]   And they're gathering information from Google
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.060]   and DoubleClick and advertising providers,
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.500]   but also offline sources.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.020]   Yes.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:45:00.700]   Government agencies, public records, private surveying
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:05.380]   companies, and all of this information gathered together.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:10.060]   And if you talk to people who know intelligence gathering,
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.740]   people in the government and outside the government
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.340]   who know intelligence gathering, they'll say, when--
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.940]   your ISP actually knows a relatively small amount about you.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.460]   But when you aggregate all of this information
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.540]   and the offline and online stuff together,
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.460]   the inaccurate picture that you can build of someone
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.620]   is much more frightening than the accurate picture.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:36.260]   And that's the--
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.140]   So give them more information, Ed.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:43.020]   Well, let's make sure it's an accurate picture.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:49.980]   Yeah, the trouble is that you don't know what information
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.420]   they own.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.820]   You're not in control of it.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:52.740]   You don't know.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.500]   And so either if something erroneous gets in there
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.420]   or something that could be misinterpreted--
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.820]   You just look at your credit report
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.820]   if you want an understanding of how this can happen
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.820]   and what it could be.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:03.320]   Sure.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:03.820]   No.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:08.500]   Or that guy who, after the Boston Marathon bombing
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.940]   was a year ago, who was at his office--
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.340]   he was married to somebody else.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:14.940]   And that's how it became a story,
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.980]   because she wrote something up on Medium.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.460]   But he was curious about whether this was possible.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.940]   Well, he was turned in by his employer, by the way.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.340]   Right, the keynote.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.620]   Understood.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.420]   But there's the point.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.300]   So imagine he hadn't been turned in by his employer,
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:36.100]   but that had simply gone into a database of search behavior
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.220]   that then got linked with something else
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.700]   and linked with something else and all of a sudden that's--
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.700]   I feel like there's not much recourse to that.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.780]   If you're-- the only recourse is to get off the internet.
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.780]   No, you're dead on.
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.860]   And what I always say about this is
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.940]   that I acknowledge that any guys that have security
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.140]   and privacy from any of these companies is a facade.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.180]   And I acknowledge that no matter what I do,
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.620]   whether I avoid Google or use other things that is a facade--
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.580]   You could be all Apple and only use Siri for your searches
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.300]   so that Google doesn't see those searches.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:06.820]   Of course.
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.620]   It's a complete-- but even though I intellectually
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.860]   know it's a facade, there's something, I think,
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.660]   that this is why I have a problem right now with Google Now.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.140]   Even though I intellectually understand
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.700]   that the information is available and is being aggregated
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.620]   by someone not Google anyway, there's
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.700]   something about seeing it presented without me giving
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.620]   my implicit or explicit rather permission--
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.100]   It's the creepy factor that you don't want.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.100]   Right.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.380]   Now, in 10 years, it probably won't be creepy.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.060]   In 10 years, it'll be the expectation.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.660]   But the problem is-- I mean, it's kind of the same thing
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.180]   with Google Now.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.740]   I'm living in the future because I love it.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.980]   I want to bathe in Google data.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.460]   Totally.
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.140]   But it's kind of like the thing the expectation is
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:41.980]   sort of like Google Glass.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.620]   It's like, this might be where things are going.
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.420]   But if you're too early, you can creep people out too much.
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:51.220]   Did Violet Blue go too far in her rant against Google?
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:51.860]   What was it?
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.900]   Thank you, jerk face.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.780]   Did you read that?
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.900]   Oh, yes, I did.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.460]   Well, it's on the same network.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.340]   It's CDNet.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   At CDNet.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.060]   Thanks for nothing jerk face, she writes.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.180]   Thanks for nothing jerk face.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.580]   And I know where she's coming from.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:11.980]   It was very heartfelt.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.300]   There was a great deal of factual accuracy in it.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:19.820]   My colleague, Jason Perlow, has written a follow up piece
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.580]   to that for a CDNet.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:25.660]   Consider it an op-ed that you might
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.980]   be able to find it there and post the link.
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:32.220]   What is his response?
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.900]   I mean, basically, it's Violet.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.940]   You knew what you were getting into when you signed up
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:36.900]   for this thing.
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.060]   And one of the reasons Violet Blue has a particular ax
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.140]   to grind here is she was a victim of what
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.940]   she calls the Nim Wars.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.340]   Early on in Google+, she wanted to use her name, which
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.980]   is obviously a pseudonym.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.380]   And Google said, no, no, you have to use your real name.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:51.580]   And this was a big problem.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.940]   Her point, though, and I think it's an interesting point,
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.980]   is that Sergey Brin, who apparently
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.860]   was a big proponent of Google+, admitted last week
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.780]   that Google+ was a mistake, he said,
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.660]   it was a mistake for me to be working on anything tangentially
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.140]   related to social to begin with.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.780]   I'm kind of a weirdo.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.140]   In other words, he didn't get it, as I think Mark Zuckerberg
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.500]   doesn't, the idea of privacy.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.460]   And he designed Google+, in a way that made sense to him.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.900]   One of the policies, of course, the real name policy.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.780]   Now, you could say, well, of course, Google
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.100]   wanted real names, it's the best way to collect data,
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.220]   is to have a single definitive name.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.020]   We can stack all that data underneath.
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:34.300]   She calls it their Velvet Glove Cast in Iron Policy.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.740]   She, of course, was a victim of it.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:42.060]   But at the end, I think it's very emotionally
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.420]   charged what she's talking about.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:49.020]   There's one fact in there that I think
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.780]   goes back to what we were just talking about.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:55.020]   What's the problem with them collecting all this information
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.980]   from you?
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:00.580]   There were a bunch of people who had either YouTube accounts
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.020]   or some other sort of Google account.
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.220]   Whistleblowers.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:09.060]   People who were a transgendered, who hadn't revealed that.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.780]   They were people who were not out at work
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.500]   as being transgendered.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.460]   And then all of a sudden, Google flipped the switch
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.740]   and said, guess what?
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:22.060]   Now, your name is going to be attached to everything
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.860]   that you've ever done in any Google service.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:29.220]   And so people said in graphic four letter words,
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.620]   oh, my goodness.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.860]   Well, she refers specifically to a person who says,
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.500]   I'm really pissed right now.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.740]   I was not ready to tell any of my coworkers.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.700]   But she was outed in effect because her real name
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.420]   was associated with her handle.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:48.540]   And the whole thing was, this wasn't like--
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:52.500]   it wasn't like someone said at Google, oh, by the way,
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.900]   we're going to do this.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.340]   You've been using this service all along.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.100]   They've allowed you to have a name that
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.740]   allows you to remain relatively anonymous.
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.420]   If someone knows who you are, they can come and find you there
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.260]   and track you down and play private detective.
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.260]   But all of a sudden, Google flipped the switch
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:12.420]   and told everyone in these people's offices
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.780]   that they're in the early processes
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:21.900]   of doing transgender assignment, gender assignment surgery.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:26.020]   And that's-- there's the nightmare scenario,
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.620]   is something that you thought was--
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.860]   you've been discreet about that you certainly
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.220]   don't want your neighbors, your friends, your family
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.100]   to know about.
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.340]   It's not because it's illegal or immoral.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:39.900]   It's because you have the--
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:40.900]   You have personal--
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:41.900]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.460]   --privacy.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.100]   Absolutely.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:43.780]   Absolutely.
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:44.820]   It's a real problem.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.300]   I mean, Netflix was sued.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.380]   And this was the case.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.020]   I actually don't think Netflix should have been sued.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.860]   But it ended up killing off that whole 1% project
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.060]   that they were working on, and it
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.480]   increased the accuracy of Netflix predictions, which
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.460]   was a great program because a woman
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.700]   said that her Netflix history--
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.900]   Netflix recommendations for her out
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.580]   of her to her employer.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.060]   I think that that is a little bit different
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.660]   than because nobody can see your Netflix recommendations.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.220]   I'm not sure how the employer saw them.
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.140]   But I think that that is a little bit different
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.740]   than what Google has done with some of the real name stuff.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.380]   But it is a real problem because, yeah,
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.820]   we all have a right to privacy.
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:24.500]   And it becomes yin and yang between how much--
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.740]   I think that most of us would be OK if a service knew our name
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:31.060]   but aren't OK with them revealing it to the broader internet.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.740]   And that's where the disconnect happens.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:37.580]   I think that Violet Blue really describes this
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:39.300]   in a strong emotional way.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:42.740]   But I think also her feelings are probably
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.140]   and will increasingly be echoed by others.
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.980]   Google searches no longer the clean.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.740]   She writes clean, high performance tool
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.420]   we once relied on and admired.
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:56.060]   Now it's a fetid stew of Google+ littered, screwed up
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.260]   mystery mechanics running under the misguided assumption
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.460]   that anyone and everyone only wants more of their own location,
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.580]   their connections.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.100]   Google's clumsily guest interests
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.140]   and Google+ favoritism and the results served back to them.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.900]   She says, Google+ tells us we are--
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.500]   Google thinks of us as little more than webs of flesh
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.220]   spun over packages of salable data.
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:22.460]   Whether that's accurate or not-- and I think it actually--
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.660]   you probably can't say it's inaccurate--
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.260]   I think this is a sentiment that is going
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.700]   to be increasingly popular.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.820]   And I think this is an opportunity for Microsoft and Apple.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.340]   It is.
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.020]   It is.
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.540]   I was having this conversation with somebody last week at WWDC.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.300]   And we were talking about DuckDuckGo,
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.340]   the alternative kind of search engine.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.660]   And even though they are a very small team
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.980]   and it's basically one guy trying
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.920]   to compete against the likes of Google
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.580]   and they're doing a good job at it, the scariest part.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.060]   And I mean this not in like, oh, my privacy or whatever.
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.260]   But one of the reasons Google has such a huge advantage
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.860]   is because they totally changed the way that search engines
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.300]   and recommendations and those things happened.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.580]   Back when Google kind of debuted in '99,
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.940]   when they were powering Yahoo's search,
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.220]   the aggregators and the search systems then
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.140]   worked in a completely different way than they do now
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.220]   where you crawl everything.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:13.180]   And for me, I understand her emotional argument.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.140]   But I think maybe the better, unemotional argument
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.180]   is that for me, anyway, Google searches
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:21.020]   have not become as good because they are so tailored.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:22.540]   I want to see the best result.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.780]   I don't really need it.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.540]   Eli Parriser's filter bubble notion
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:28.940]   that you're now kind of living in a bubble
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:29.660]   of your own creation.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.020]   Oh, without a doubt.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:31.540]   Without a doubt.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.460]   I mean, bias confirmation is a very real thing.
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.260]   And if I'm trying to find information about something,
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.580]   I don't really want to see my own results first.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.940]   I want to see what's best from the internet as a whole.
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.300]   And you do get that from data aggregation.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.500]   I think that's really good.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.020]   But I think that if you just personalize,
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.060]   you can do two deeply personalized things
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.780]   where it no longer is serving the best info.
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.220]   But at the same time, how do you really
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.060]   compete with Google?
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.100]   Because even Microsoft has been trying
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:56.940]   to do search for a long time.
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.340]   They've had such a huge head start
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:02.340]   and they have so much data that for anybody else to compete.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.860]   I don't know if it's possible without many, many years
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.780]   of doing things.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.020]   And also, frankly, probably collecting as much information.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.980]   I don't know if it's even possible to come up
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.940]   with the alternative that is as accurate,
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.340]   whether it's personalized or not.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.860]   Well, I think Apple must have sensed this change
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.460]   in the zeitgeist because it seems very clear they're
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.620]   taking air aim straight at Google.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.740]   It's toxic.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.300]   Hellstew and Android.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.820]   And there was another--
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.860]   There was another zdnet quote that was actually on stage
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.300]   at WWDC.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.060]   Adrian Kingsley Hughes.
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.140]   There was Adrian Kingsley Hughes.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.060]   Yeah, zdnet's getting a reputation this week.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.540]   I guess I better say something--
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.100]   Start writing some inflammatory prose here.
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.100]   You're not using enough--
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:51.380]   You know, when I'm the calm-measured guy.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.820]   You know you got a problem.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.500]   Well, I think Apple-- we're going to take a break.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:55.900]   But come back.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.180]   We will talk about actually some of the things Apple announced
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:58.980]   at WWDC.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.780]   But I think this is a real opportunity for Apple.
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.100]   And it's very clear they see this as an opportunity.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.660]   And one of the main points of WWDC,
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.660]   both with Yosemite, the next version of OS 10,
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.420]   and with iOS 8 is we're going to get the Google out.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.340]   Even if you do a search in Spotlight now,
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.860]   you might have some Google search results in there.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.860]   But they will be disintermediated.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.860]   Apple will show up in the Google search result, not you.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.780]   Or read my Google search information, not you.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.300]   They do offer DuckDuckGo.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.900]   And so-- can I get some clarification?
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.540]   Isn't DuckDuckGo using Google?
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.940]   Are they just sanitizing the results?
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:36.460]   Correct.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:36.980]   Both.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:37.780]   Yes.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.260]   From right now, they're basically using Google.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:39.820]   But they are--
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.620]   It's kind of cheating.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.620]   It's kind of cheating.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:43.860]   If you want to use a Google service,
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.780]   the deal is you give them information.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.700]   And it's kind of cheating.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.980]   Say, well, I'm going to keep the information myself.
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:51.020]   And I want to use the service.
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:51.740]   Don't use Google.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.100]   We get sidetracked.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.620]   We get sidetracked on this for an entire segment.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.940]   But there's companies like ask.com,
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.660]   which have built an entire business
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.580]   around taking Google search results.
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:03.980]   And repackaging it.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:07.540]   Putting their own crappy ads on top,
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.180]   which are served by Google.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.420]   Right.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:15.620]   And so delivering an ad-heavy, horrible--
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.780]   OK, that's crappy.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.620]   Very important.
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.580]   But DuckDuckGo's results are just repackaged Google results.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.860]   For the most part, for the most part,
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:26.340]   I mean, Google, most people don't realize this.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.700]   As many APIs as they have, there's no actual search API.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:32.540]   And that's probably to prevent more of exactly what
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.780]   Ask does and even DuckDuckGo.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.820]   So you have to kind of creatively kind of reverse
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.700]   engineer or scrape different results.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.020]   But from what I understand it-- and I might be wrong.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.580]   And so if I'm wrong, I'm sure people in the chat
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.220]   or on Twitter will tell me.
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.900]   But I think that DuckDuckGo is also
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.780]   looking to increase its own scraping and capabilities
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.700]   to offer their own results, too.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.140]   They would have to, because if all you're doing
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.660]   is having an anonymized Google results,
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.380]   then for a lot of people, that's not
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.740]   going to be enough of a good experience.
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.140]   This is one advantage Google has.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:05.100]   There's a huge barrier to entry for creating
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.180]   an equivalent to Google.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:08.100]   And it gets bigger every year, especially as Google
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:09.940]   aggregates personal information and other things.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.460]   Right.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:10.740]   Right.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:11.340]   I mean, that's my point.
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.420]   I don't know if anybody--
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.780]   I don't think the next Google, at least in the model
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.100]   that works now, I don't think it's
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:17.500]   possible that anybody could really
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.380]   build or truly compete with it, building it from the ground up
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:24.060]   unless I actually don't even think--
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.740]   because there's just enough time.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.580]   So much of-- it's maps the same way.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:30.380]   Apple Maps was a problematic product for lots of reasons.
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:35.100]   But one of the main reasons is that Google Maps had a decade,
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.620]   almost, of built up information.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.220]   And also, for many years, users themselves
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.580]   sourced a lot of the location and destination information.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:46.100]   And that made the product so much better over time.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.060]   So trying to build your own with buying companies
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.580]   and say, no, we can just put this together
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.020]   and it will be an equivalent.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:52.860]   We'll know actually it won't.
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.180]   So this is what DuckDuckGo says.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.380]   They get their results from over 100 sources,
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.540]   including DuckDuck bot, our own crawler,
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.900]   crowdsourced sites like Wikipedia, Yahoo through laws.
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.100]   That's the cousin of mine.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:07.620]   Yandex, which is another search, Wolfram Alpha, Yelp, and Bing.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.140]   But they do also say, while our indexes are getting bigger,
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:12.820]   we do not expect to be wholly independent from third parties.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.340]   Bing and Google each spend hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:15.840]   a year.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:16.700]   I think it's more than that.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.660]   Crawling and indexing the deep web
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.300]   have cost so much that even big companies like Yahoo
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:24.340]   and Ask are giving up general crawling and indexing.
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.820]   Therefore, it seems silly to compete on crawling.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.940]   Besides, we don't have the money to do so.
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:34.460]   So don't expect an independent competitive search engine
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:36.820]   from DuckDuckGo, Yahoo or anybody else, frankly.
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:38.900]   Although I have to think, somewhere
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.300]   in a laboratory in the basement at one infinite loop,
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.260]   there is a team trying to create Apple Search.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:46.340]   It really feels like that.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:47.380]   You don't think so?
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.700]   No, no, I don't think so.
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.460]   That's--
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:54.060]   Then it feels like they're stealing Google's results.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.540]   Christine is absolutely right.
[00:59:55.540 --> 01:00:00.260]   That is so-- the resources that it takes--
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.380]   it's an entire business to build there.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.780]   Very expensive.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.180]   And you can do mapping.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:13.820]   You can do a lot of specialized types of information
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.500]   that you can do.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.060]   But to be a general purpose provider of information
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:24.740]   at your fingertips is a massive business all of itself.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:28.540]   And it's a tar baby, too.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.340]   Because once you get involved in it,
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.140]   you can't let go.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:37.540]   You have to just keep throwing money at it.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.220]   And if you're competing with Google for whom
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:45.660]   it's the primary source of business,
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.260]   they're going to break you.
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:54.340]   It's going to be like the Cold War, where you finally
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.260]   put the Russians out of business because they couldn't
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:59.540]   keep up with the Cold War.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.060]   Well, take a break.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.060]   I do want to talk about some specifics from Apple.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:03.980]   There's a lot more to talk about.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.460]   The Turing test--
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.500]   I know.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:06.940]   You know what?
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.300]   This show should be eight hours long.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.020]   And even then, I think we get to enter.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:14.620]   The Turing test is Uber worth $18.2 billion.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.460]   There's a whole talk about barriers to entry.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.420]   There are none.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.860]   There's a whole lot more to talk about.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.380]   We've got a great team, though, to do it.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.340]   Ed bot is here from ZDNet, Christina Warren from Mashable.
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.540]   Great to have you guys on.
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.340]   I'm really-- this is fun.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:30.740]   Our show today brought you by GoToMeeting, folks.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.180]   You got to meet.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.620]   You may not like it.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.100]   But if you're in business getting the heads together,
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.060]   all in the same room around the table
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.340]   is probably the only way to cut through the Gordian
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.780]   not of confusion and disagreement.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.580]   We have a three-email policy.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.980]   If you can't solve it in the email,
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.580]   you're going to get together in the same room
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.580]   and hammer it out.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.180]   It's where creativity happens.
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.540]   But nowadays, everybody's on the road.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.700]   There's offices all over the world.
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.420]   How do you get people in the same room when they're not
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.100]   in the same office?
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.460]   You do it with technology.
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:04.060]   Millions of small business professionals, big businesses
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.300]   to rely on Citrix GoToMeeting.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.900]   The solution, the one we use and recommend
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.940]   for meeting and collaborating online.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.820]   With GoToMeeting, you share the same screen.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.700]   So you're on the same page with documents, presentations.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.460]   With built-in HD video conferencing,
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.740]   you can see each other face to face, just like you're in person.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.020]   And because you pay one low flat monthly rate,
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.420]   you get to have as many meetings as you want as long as you want.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.540]   I know many teams keep going to meeting running all day long.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.340]   You can present, demonstrate, and just simply
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.300]   meet anywhere with any Mac, PC, tablet, or smartphone.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.260]   You can even present from an iPad.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.740]   See why millions choose GoToMeeting.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:42.820]   You could start hosting your own meetings within seconds.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.020]   Right now, it's very quick to sign up.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.380]   And you've got it free for 30 days.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:50.300]   Just visit GoToMeeting.com, click the Try It Free button.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.420]   And just do me a favor where it says,
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.180]   what's the promo code?
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.460]   Use the promo code TWIT.
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.420]   And they'll know where you heard it.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.540]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.140]   30 days free when you use the offer code.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.340]   TWIT.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.180]   So let's see.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.020]   iOS 8-- no hardware was announced.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.620]   Contrary to some rumors, Mark Herman at 9 to 5 Mac said,
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.500]   there's going to be hardware.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.340]   Nope.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.340]   And Apple's done it before.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.940]   Wouldn't be unreasonable.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:20.300]   Mark Herman is usually very good about those things.
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:24.860]   He is not Gene Munster.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.780]   Notoriously bad.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.020]   No, in fact, I was surprised.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:33.020]   We had Mark on the TN2 techniques tonight that afternoon.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:37.940]   And he said, well, he said Apple changed the name of HealthKit
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.580]   to Health because of him, which I think is going a little far.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.580]   But it wasn't called HealthBook.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.580]   It was called HealthKit and Health.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.340]   And they did not announce any new hardware.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.620]   But they announced so much in software
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.260]   that I think that that's probably fine.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:57.860]   A two-hour jam-packed keynote that went off without a hitch.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.380]   I thought was very well done.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:04.660]   I think Apple was very on point in the presentation.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:10.260]   I have to point out, though, that it's all air until Apple does it.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.460]   And they can say, we're going to do iCloud Drive.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.620]   And we finally get the cloud.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.820]   But their history shows they don't.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.900]   So the home automation's great, but you've
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.460]   got to get everybody to sign up.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.700]   HealthKit is great.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.340]   But if you have no health devices of your own,
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.140]   it relies entirely on third parties.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.780]   And they didn't mention of any eye watches.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:39.460]   They say, you're going to be able to work in the iCloud
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.700]   Drive, just as you do with Google Drive or Dropbox.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.060]   Not available yet.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.460]   They say you can say, hey, Siri and Siri will respond.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.620]   You'll be able to take a picture of your credit card
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.180]   with your iPhone and pay that way.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.100]   But you guys believe this is all going to happen.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.180]   Well, I mean, execution is always the problem with Apple,
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:58.680]   right?
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.480]   I mean, especially when it comes to the cloud stuff.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.800]   And it's the problem for everybody.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.600]   I mean, you don't know until you execute.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.960]   I think that, for instance, iCloud Drive, there's absolutely
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.320]   no reason to believe that it won't work as well or better
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.400]   than Dropbox does.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   Why do you say that?
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.240]   They have never been able to do this.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:12.800]   No, no, no.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.280]   What I mean is the integration with Finder.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.640]   I don't mean that the cloud services itself.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.140]   I mean--
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.000]   But I'll give you an example.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.200]   iCloud was supposed to have documents synced
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.400]   for the last three years.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:21.900]   No.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.760]   Oh, I'm not talking about the sync in the services.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.800]   I mean, what I mean is that--
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.840]   I'm just saying they have no track record to say
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.280]   that you should have confidence.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.640]   No, and cloud, absolutely not.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.880]   But what I mean more is as how it natively integrates
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.360]   to Finder.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.040]   That's all I mean.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.040]   You know why it's going to work?
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.840]   Because it's based on Azure.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.160]   But all of it's been based on Azure.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:39.520]   I know.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.320]   I'm just kidding.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.360]   Right, of course.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.520]   But I mean, so I mean, execution is the big key.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:47.120]   And that's where I'm the most, I guess, skeptical
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.160]   is with any of the cloud stuff, whether it's cloud kit
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.840]   or iCloud Drive or anything else.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.080]   The crop taken a picture of your credit card thing,
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.840]   yeah, that's going to work because they've
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.320]   had the ability to do that with their gift cards
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.040]   for several years.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:00.440]   That's true.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.640]   You just hold up your barcode.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.160]   You're right.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.400]   I forgot to the camera.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.400]   And it registers it.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.600]   Well, and every bank can do that with checks today.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.100]   I know.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:09.600]   I do.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   I do.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   I do.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.100]   I do.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.040]   That's not exactly--
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:11.540]   OK.
[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:12.040]   All right.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:12.540]   All right.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.040]   All right.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:13.540]   All right.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.040]   All right.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:14.040]   All right.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:14.540]   All right.
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.040]   All right.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:15.540]   All right.
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:16.040]   All right.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.040]   All right.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.040]   All right.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040]   All right.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040]   All right.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.040]   All right.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.040]   All right.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040]   All right.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040]   All right.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:24.540]   All right.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:24.540]   All right.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:24.540]   All right.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:24.540]   All right.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.540]   I think they'll all sign up.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.240]   But again, it comes down to execution.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:30.340]   And is this going to be the best way we do things?
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.140]   So I mean--
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:31.640]   How excited?
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.140]   They said everything right.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.140]   No.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:34.140]   Totally.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:34.940]   But I mean, but you're right.
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.340]   I mean, the proof is once the stuff launches,
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.740]   will it work the way we say it well?
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.980]   I'm most excited about things like handoff and continuity.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.140]   But I'm also--
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:43.840]   That's cool too.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.740]   You can be working on your desktop.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.500]   Now, of course, this promotes the idea
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.780]   that you have only Apple hardware.
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.500]   But if you have an iPad and an iPhone,
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.660]   you can hand off documents as you go
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:54.980]   to various devices.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:55.780]   Can we do that?
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.220]   We can do that in Office 365.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.420]   Can't we end?
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:06:59.220]   Well, yeah.
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.900]   So there's two different approaches to things here.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:06.860]   And it's solving the same problem from two different ways.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.940]   Microsoft's approach to continuity
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:12.140]   is to say everything is in OneDrive.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.220]   And so if you--
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.540]   And it saves automatically as you go.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.660]   So if you are working on something on your phone,
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.580]   and then you walk into your office
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.620]   and set your phone down and sit down at your computer,
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:28.540]   you can open up Word or Excel or whatever you are creating
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.860]   that document in.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.660]   And there it is in your--
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:34.500]   you just click the file thing.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.180]   And there's the file that you are working on,
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.780]   and you click it, and you're right exactly where you left off.
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.980]   There's a slight amount of friction in there.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:47.780]   But I'm not sure that the absence of friction
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:54.860]   that comes with walking in and having my document magically
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.380]   show up on my Mac when it was on my iPhone
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.460]   is anything more than demoware.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.420]   Right.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.020]   It does feel like demoware, doesn't it?
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:04.180]   I don't know.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.260]   I'm frequently in a position where
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.140]   I'm working on something either a document or an email
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:09.860]   or something else.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.700]   And I get called into a meeting, and I
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.180]   have to make a split-second decision.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.540]   Do I take my iPad?
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.500]   Or do I take my MacBook Air with me?
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.860]   And the ability to pull it up instantly where I am
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.140]   without having to go through that friction--
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.340]   and I agree it's minimal.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.260]   It's definitely minimal.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.580]   But I think having a lack of that is a good thing.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.820]   But I think the bigger thing is that if you can do it,
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:31.980]   it'll work with iOS and Mac apps, obviously.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.660]   But it'll also work with a web page.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:37.380]   So that means that you can send off where you are in a web
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.500]   page or a web app, too.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.100]   And that's really useful, especially if the web page
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.140]   has maybe an iOS counterpart.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.900]   So I think that there's a lot of potential there
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.540]   for the handoff stuff.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.020]   But I also really like the fact that, for instance,
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.060]   I can answer my phone call--
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.100]   my iPhone from my Mac now.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.220]   And I can make an outgoing call from my Mac
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.140]   without having to use a third-party tool
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.820]   or go through other gyrations.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:05.900]   And those might be edge use cases, but that is right.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.740]   I mean, the way that Apple and Microsoft
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.780]   are approaching this sort of continuity thing--
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:12.460]   and Google, for that matter, too--
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.820]   are all taking different approaches.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.340]   Google, it's always about the cloud being first and foremost,
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.460]   that the web browser is the destination.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.300]   Microsoft, it's all about OneDrive.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.740]   And with Apple, whether they'll succeed with the execution
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.260]   or not-- and again, the execution here,
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.860]   I think, more important than anything else,
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:27.820]   is absolutely key.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.700]   If you can't rely on it, you won't use it--
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:32.740]   is to make the service aspect, the cloud part,
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:38.740]   disappear, and just make it app-based so that it will be able to
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.860]   kind of work seamlessly.
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.140]   But I think that part of it is probably demo-aware.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:45.540]   But I can see real use cases, especially when I'm working on
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.980]   something and then have to immediately switch locations.
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:52.260]   And I might not want to take the same machine with me.
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:56.580]   And even if it is demo-aware, it certainly sells Macintosh,
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.180]   iPad, and iPhone, because you--
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:09:59.860]   Definitely.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.020]   Even if you never use this, you do want everything to work
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.860]   together smoothly, don't you?
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:04.740]   Yes, in a way.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.340]   I wrote a column about this week, and I--
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.220]   about that this week, and I should have put it in the show
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.380]   notes.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.180]   Sorry, I think we could find your column.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:23.020]   What's interesting to me is that there's some neat, new stuff
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.940]   and some interesting borrowed stuff in OS 10 Yosemite.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:34.540]   But a lot of it is just basically refining what we all
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.700]   know as a desktop operating system.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.740]   There's very little that's new in there.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:45.500]   The desktop operating system, Yosemite, it has become, in
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:52.260]   many extents, an extension of the primary device, which is
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:52.980]   the mobile device.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.980]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.580]   What a switch that is.
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:59.460]   Yeah, and so one of the big slides I think I put it at the
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.220]   top of the column that I wrote--
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.860]   this should be the most recent one on my page there--
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:13.180]   is Tim Cook standing there, 80 million Mac install base.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:20.980]   80 million is the same number of phones, Windows 8 phones.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:21.700]   Isn't that funny?
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:24.380]   It's got the same penetration as Windows 8 phones.
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.500]   Yeah, and so--
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.620]   That's wild.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:32.660]   200 million iPads and 500 million iPhones sold.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.100]   That's not the install base, but it's actually pretty close
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.580]   because they're both new categories and so very few of
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:41.420]   those devices have been retired or destroyed.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.940]   So you've got something probably 600 million Apple
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:52.060]   mobile devices and only 80 million Mac devices.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:56.900]   So the continuity thing, although it's interesting, it
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:03.580]   really seems to me to be more of a way to appeal to us
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:08.900]   journalists who still carry around the big purpose--
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900]   all purpose devices.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:14.380]   Well, is it also that a lot of Mac, iPhone, and iPad users
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.180]   don't use Macs, they use Windows machines?
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:16.460]   Yes.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.900]   Of course, there's no continuity.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.060]   And there's much--
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:19.780]   --pretty for that.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:26.340]   And so that to me was the thing there was almost a, OK, I
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   like the way this is working together.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.460]   If you happen to be all in--
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:34.260]   It's your reward for being all in.
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.620]   Your Apple Platinum.
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.740]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:41.140]   You got an Apple Platinum account, baby.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:42.860]   And--
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.140]   You do have to wonder--
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:48.140]   I got to say, you do have to wonder if Apple will respond
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.060]   to this by putting more of their services on Windows.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:53.340]   My guess is they will not.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.700]   I don't-- yeah, I agree.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:55.700]   I think that--
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.020]   iCloud drive is there.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.340]   But it's barely-- is it there?
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.940]   iCloud's really--
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:01.440]   Really?
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:01.980]   You think so?
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:02.300]   OK.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:02.980]   They announced--
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.060]   And it's not--
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:07.620]   --scroll down that same article, and you'll see the screenshot.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:13.740]   And what's interesting about that screenshot is that--
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:14.860]   There you go.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:20.220]   iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch Mac, or PC?
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.420]   And they even showed a demo or a very brief Windows
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.380]   screenshot during the keynote.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.460]   I mean, to be totally fair, before I call Drive,
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:31.620]   managing your iPhoto stuff, like your photo stream
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:34.340]   was actually easier on Windows than it was on the Mac,
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.300]   because you had a visible place where you could see all
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:37.940]   the photos.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.460]   And on the Mac, they've had kind of a hidden directory
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.420]   that you've got to go through a bunch of gyrations
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:46.140]   to try to find if you want to just see your photo stream
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.420]   and pipe it in from the web.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.900]   I mean, you know, make no mistake-- and I wrote about this
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.180]   when retained to the Apple buying Beats thing.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:58.820]   You know, the iPod was a success for one-- primarily
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.060]   for one reason or one reason only.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.020]   It had Windows support.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.900]   I mean, like, we can't forget that.
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.780]   Much of Steve Jobs didn't want it.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:06.780]   No, but he realized that's the only way it could work.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:10.140]   And the same thing, the iPhone more clearly--
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:11.740]   I mean, just looking at the in-number of install base,
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:16.100]   clearly, you know, more people have a computer running Windows--
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:16.980]   But that's my question.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.980]   --who I've run on Earth.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.940]   Maybe because--
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.220]   Aren't we in that post-PC world where maybe they don't
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.340]   have Windows or Macintosh?
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.780]   Yeah, I think that what Apple's take us--
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.820]   and it's decidedly different than Microsoft's--
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.860]   is that we are in a post-PC world,
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:33.460]   but we aren't in the world where it's all one system yet.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.100]   Whereas Microsoft seems to be wanting
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.140]   to say that we are all in the system
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.460]   where you can have the same interface,
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:41.140]   the same basic code base, the same everything,
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.780]   and you can access, you know, all of your devices virtually
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:47.020]   look the same and have some of the same features.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.580]   Apple is taking a very different approach
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.260]   in that we can make these things work better together,
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:56.020]   but a laptop still has a different use case than an iPad
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:56.820]   or a phone.
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:01.340]   And I personally-- and how I use things, that's true.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.860]   I think that it's very hard to say
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.020]   that more people might be using their primary devices
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.180]   as a phone or tablet.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:06.980]   That's totally fair.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.780]   But I think that when you are using a laptop,
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.660]   most people don't use it when they're doing things
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.700]   on it other than web browsing.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.060]   Most people use it considerably differently
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.020]   than they do when they're on a tablet or phone.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.740]   So rather than having the artist formerly known
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:24.100]   as MedFro interface, kind of dominating the entire thing,
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.140]   it's about, rather than having everything
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.780]   have the same interface and feel like it's
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.180]   part of the same platform, this is all about,
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.020]   you use these devices for different things,
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.980]   but we're going to make it easier for you
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.780]   to use those devices together.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.180]   And then at some point down the line,
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.460]   maybe it makes more sense to unify everything
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:43.140]   under one name and one core interface.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:48.140]   Let's see, home, this is something that Google's trying
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.980]   to do, Microsoft's been trying to do for more than a decade,
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.020]   the idea of unifying home automation systems,
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.340]   nobody's succeeded.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:16:00.340]   It's a tower of Babel of different protocols,
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.460]   nothing talks to anything else.
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.740]   Going back to the days of the X10,
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.340]   can Apple unify this system and make it work?
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.500]   I think they will do a better job than anybody else has
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.820]   in terms of getting people to sign up,
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.860]   getting manufacturers to get the MFI,
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:19.380]   made for iPhone, made for iPad, made for home certification,
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:21.340]   which is one big part of the challenge.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.940]   And it's interesting because HomeKit has two parts.
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.620]   So one part is that you can use your iDevice
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.540]   to be your interface controller
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.740]   and that you can use that to control everything.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:33.060]   But the other thing is you can still have
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.540]   your individual apps.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.900]   And there are a lot of people who are trying to aggregate
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.180]   and create a central dashboard for home automation.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.100]   There's zone off, there's a ball, there's a smart things.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.420]   I think that Apple will probably have more success
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.820]   just because they're Apple
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:49.060]   and the people who are buying right now anyway,
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.380]   home automation things still tend to skew more Apple
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:53.900]   than other types of devices.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.900]   That doesn't mean that won't change over time.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.300]   But as we're finally entering a place where,
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.340]   the idea of home automation is no longer a crustron
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:03.580]   and other super expensive, super difficult situations,
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.900]   but Phillips Hue bulbs and the Nest thermostat
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:08.980]   and things like that, drop cam, things like that,
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:11.540]   they will have a better chance of getting everybody
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.060]   under one roof.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.140]   I don't think ultimately they might be like the name
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.380]   in home automation, so to speak,
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.460]   but I think they can definitely push things
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.100]   towards a certain standard.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.140]   And that's desperately needed.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:25.260]   I think that I've always argued that being late
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:27.740]   is just as bad as being early rather,
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.020]   is just as bad as being late.
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:32.260]   And I think that as much as Microsoft has put into
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.540]   a lot of the home automation stuff,
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:35.060]   they were just too early.
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:35.900]   And now--
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.460]   - As they were with tablet computing?
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.660]   - Completely, completely.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:39.740]   And timing is everything.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:42.420]   And I think that right now, the reason that I think
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.900]   that Apple could succeed has less to do with the fact
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:47.180]   that their technology or that even their approach
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:51.300]   is any different, but it's because it's the right time.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.380]   The stuff has gotten easy enough to use
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.980]   and affordable enough that it's the right time.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:57.780]   And I think that Apple also, by setting certain--
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.900]   by making it very clear that all the devices
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.020]   that are home-kidded enabled can talk to one another
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.940]   and see one another, is something that the other platforms
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.620]   that are trying to kind of bring everything
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:10.220]   that are one roof have not done.
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:13.260]   For instance, if you change the name of a device
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:15.260]   in its connected to home-kidd,
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:18.780]   every other device in your system will see
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:19.860]   that the name has changed.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:23.140]   So that it's not gonna display, say you have,
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:25.980]   living room one and you change it to basement.
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:28.260]   That basement will show up across things
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.660]   without anything having to update.
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:31.020]   And those are the sorts of details,
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.980]   especially when it comes to trying to do
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.820]   more complex setups that I think are really important.
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:40.820]   So Apple brings to a more humanized approach
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.780]   to making things work together
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.740]   so that your mom can use it.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:49.740]   But I think the timing is probably the biggest reason
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.300]   they will probably be successful,
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.900]   at least at getting people signed up.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.100]   Again, executions, everything.
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.980]   If it doesn't work correctly, then no one cares.
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:58.180]   But I think that the timing right now
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.660]   and the fact that they do have such a good name
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:03.100]   when it comes to getting people to adopt things,
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.540]   especially early adopters,
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.700]   will probably bode well for them,
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.540]   at least in getting all the major players
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.900]   to sign up and agree to maybe not at the expense of others,
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.860]   but to add home-kidd support
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.420]   into their devices and software.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:21.380]   - I would buy an iPhone 6 if they make it a bigger screen
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.620]   that could talk to all my devices.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.740]   - And it ran Android.
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:26.980]   - And it ran Android.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:29.500]   (laughing)
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.660]   You took the words right out of my mouth, Ed, but.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.500]   - We're gonna take a break.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.340]   We got lots more to talk.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.940]   - Are there any other announcements that Apple made
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.660]   this week that you guys that I have overlooked?
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.500]   - Swift.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.500]   - Swift, I was just saying.
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.260]   - New programming language.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.100]   - Awesome.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.700]   - Oh, everybody's got new programming languages.
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.900]   - Well, but a new programming language,
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:51.540]   this is one, this one just cracks me up.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:56.540]   Because, and I think it's great that they're doing it
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.380]   and I'm completely understanding of
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.660]   and supportive of the reasons for doing it,
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.100]   but I will tell you what,
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.140]   if Redmond had done the same thing,
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.860]   the machine gun fire would have been relentless.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.820]   - But didn't Redmond do the same thing with C#?
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:15.420]   Isn't that essentially what C# did was take these old C
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:19.180]   cruft out of the language
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:21.220]   and make it more modern and more secure?
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.300]   Isn't that what C# was doing?
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:23.300]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.140]   - You did.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:28.020]   - Basically, and took fire for it.
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:29.700]   But this is what you have to do.
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.380]   And so what Apple has done is to say,
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.140]   well, we're introducing this new language
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:38.780]   and you should learn it now
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.740]   and start writing programs in it now.
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.540]   But a year from now, a lot of the stuff that you've written
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.980]   will probably be deprecated
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.340]   because we're still learning and-
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.900]   - Do they say that really?
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.580]   - Yes. - That's not good.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.220]   - No, I mean, I think it's just the language.
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:55.380]   - Who would write the language is gonna be deprecated.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.180]   - That's how pro-
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.180]   No, it's not the language.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.020]   - It's about the calls.
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:58.860]   - It's gonna be deprecated.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:02.420]   - The calls, but that's how languages have to evolve.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:03.740]   You have to try them.
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.340]   And then when things don't work,
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.900]   you fix them.
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:09.460]   And the only way you get it.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.140]   So I completely support Apple's approach on this,
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.580]   but it is also one of those things.
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.660]   It is remarkably Microsoft-like.
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:21.300]   In fact, one of the themes of WWDC that I saw was,
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:25.940]   you know, Microsoft, with such an Adele out coming on board,
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.020]   he picked up the one Microsoft thing
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.380]   where the different divisions are not responsible
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.340]   for different products.
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:33.700]   They're responsible for making sure
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:36.660]   that all the technologies work together on all the products.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:40.220]   And I thought you could have just as easily put
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.980]   a big one Apple slide at WWDC,
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:48.940]   with people saying, this is no longer just for iOS,
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.700]   this is no longer just for OS X,
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.660]   this is no longer just for this piece of hardware.
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.540]   Everything has to work together
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:59.620]   and everything in our frameworks and languages
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:03.020]   and even down to the chip level support
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.500]   is going to work together that way.
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:10.540]   And I think, you know, it's funny how,
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:14.100]   although the companies are as different
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.060]   as they could possibly be in many ways,
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.540]   they're converging on a lot of the same ideas.
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:19.380]   One Apple.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:20.620]   - That's the same business.
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.220]   To be fair, Apple never had the inner nice even warfare
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.940]   that really, I think, hobbled Microsoft for a good way.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.500]   - No, it's not a doubt.
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.100]   I mean, if you hadn't had the DOJ thing,
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.940]   then Microsoft would be in a different position
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:31.780]   than it is now.
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.980]   I mean, that made a lot of challenges.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.300]   Now, correct me if I'm wrong on this one, Ed,
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.380]   but I think that one of the things
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.620]   that I really like about Swift,
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.140]   and this is something that even though,
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:40.860]   well, eight, there are two reasons why they're getting
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.780]   this response they're getting and Microsoft's not.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.780]   One, the number of developers who in the enterprise
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:48.220]   work with Apple stuff is almost nonexistent,
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.660]   whereas, you know, when Microsoft introduced C#,
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.180]   you have a much bigger, you know,
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.900]   contingent of active working developers who are going,
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.980]   "Oh my God, you've just screwed up
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.700]   "everything I'm going to do."
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.780]   But the second thing is, and this is what I think Apple
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:01.940]   has always been great about,
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:05.940]   and this goes back to when they switched from, you know,
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.940]   power PC to Intel, and it even goes into the, you know,
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.780]   carbon to cocoa transfers,
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.420]   is they make the things work together.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.660]   So your Swift code will compile and sit and work directly
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:17.060]   with Objective-C code.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.380]   Now, and they will be supporting Objective-C
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:22.620]   until, you know, it comes to a point where it's so used
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:25.380]   minimally if it ever comes to that point that it won't be used.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:30.180]   So there's not as much of a risk if you're building a new app
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.220]   to try to say, "Well, I want to go ahead and learn Swift
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.900]   "because it, so it can't do everything Objective-C can do,
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:36.980]   "but you can use the parts together."
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:39.260]   When C# came out, and again, please correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:43.660]   but I don't think that it could sit side by side in the editor
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:47.940]   and in the IDE and work alongside, you know, the C
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.740]   and even like the, you know, VB stuff.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:54.300]   I, you know, it seemed like it was a completely new thing.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.140]   - Yeah, right.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:58.380]   Well, different era, different customer bases
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:01.300]   and different even size of applications.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.140]   - Right.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:07.140]   - You know, I mean, so the simplicity of the app model
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:12.100]   in the modern era is in the favor of making a change like this.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.580]   - I think Swift is sort of interesting for other reasons too.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:18.540]   It's an attempt to make a language that...
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.380]   - The developers don't hate.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.300]   - Hey. - Hey.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:24.340]   - No semi-colons, but also that promotes
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.100]   secure programming eliminates a lot of the constructs
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.700]   and the things that programmers do that give them in trouble.
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:35.060]   I love the playground, the idea that you can,
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:38.020]   I think this is a smart move because it encourages
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:41.500]   young people who are learning to program to do it with Swift.
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.340]   - Yes.
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.500]   - And so that could be a great way to kind of grow
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.660]   a body of Swift developers.
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:51.380]   I downloaded from Git over the weekend a,
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:53.820]   somebody wrote Flappy Bird in Swift.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.180]   - So cool, so cool.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.300]   I love that they did that.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.660]   And I personally, I learned languages by taking stuff apart.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:02.420]   And I was looking at it and I was so impressed
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:03.700]   that they were able to do it so quickly.
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:04.700]   - Quickly. - Like in a day.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.180]   - It was up in less than a day.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:07.980]   Like Swift had been out for less than a day
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:08.820]   and there was already a Flappy Bird.
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:11.180]   - Which may say more about how simple Flappy Bird is
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:12.020]   that have good Swift tips.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.340]   - But isn't that why it's the perfect Hello World?
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.180]   - Yeah.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.020]   - Right?
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:17.580]   Like it used to be tip calculators and now it's Flappy Bird.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.420]   And I think that Flappy Bird works even better
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.980]   because you have this kind of visualness.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:25.820]   But yeah, I mean, I think that the guy who was responsible
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.620]   for Swift and Apple on his own blog,
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:29.780]   he said that one of the things for playgrounds
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:31.900]   that was this inspiration is an IDE.
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.500]   And it was originally Kickstarter backed called
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.540]   that light table.
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.380]   And light table does the same sort of instant preview thing.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.860]   And it's a great way to work with,
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.580]   with the language, especially if you're new to it,
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:43.780]   whether you're a kid or an adult,
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.940]   having that live preview thing is so good.
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:48.180]   And I think having it built in at the IDE level
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.060]   is just awesome. - Osprey is pretty cool.
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:50.900]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:52.420]   I mean, that's something that really puts them.
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.740]   I mean, Microsoft always has had really good tools.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:59.220]   Google not so much, but Apple's really stepped up
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.460]   their tool game to a tremendous degree.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.220]   You know, they've always had really good interface tools,
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:05.100]   but some of their code stuff hasn't been as good.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:08.300]   And that was one of the things that looking at Xcode 6,
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.740]   I was like, wow, they've really, really stepped up their game.
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:14.860]   - The company that did the Flappy Bird for Swift
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.460]   is called Fullstack.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:20.700]   They're at fullstack.edu.com.
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.740]   And they're gonna do a Swift course.
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:26.060]   And that, the reason they did that language, of course,
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:29.020]   that game, of course, is to, as the kind of the cornerstone
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.780]   of their, it's using Sprite Kit.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:34.380]   It actually shows how well the Apple technologies work
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.660]   to do something stupid like Flappy Bird.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.300]   - Yeah, well, they've certainly got to the point
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:43.300]   where there are enough iOS developers and mostly iOS
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:47.740]   to make, to go back to my earlier point,
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.340]   mostly iOS developers.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:53.780]   And so the idea, I think most of them are going to say,
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:55.980]   we don't have to use Objective-C, that's a win.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:56.980]   - Yeah.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:57.820]   - Yeah.
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.940]   - It's a nice looking language.
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:01.780]   I liked it, I was impressed by it.
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:04.900]   - I was talking to a couple of current and former Microsoft
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.180]   people about Swift.
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.580]   And one guy had worked in their old division
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.500]   for a long time on iOS stuff,
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.100]   but he worked another stuff at Microsoft too.
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.220]   And he was really impressed.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.060]   And one guy I worked with, I talked to,
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:18.700]   he is basically a C# developer by day.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.340]   And used to actually work at Microsoft.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:23.340]   And he said that he's wanted to learn iOS for a long time,
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:25.940]   but the barrier of learning Objective-C
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.980]   has kept him out and looking at this,
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:29.260]   especially since the syntax,
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:30.820]   I mean, it's most similar to Ruby and Rust,
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:34.460]   but it's also very similar to the way that C# works
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.580]   and C# is a great language,
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:41.580]   that he feels much better about going into iOS development.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:43.260]   And then that's something he feels like
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.940]   he can even take back to the decision makers
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:47.980]   and stakeholders at his company,
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.500]   if they wanna say, hey, we need to build this.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.460]   We need to work on iOS.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.940]   He's not going to get as much blowback because of Swift.
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:57.500]   So I think that there are a lot of reasons why
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.260]   it's a good move, but I think one of the big ones
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:02.540]   is Ed points out, there are a lot more iOS developers.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.220]   But I also think, if you're looking at
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.220]   how do you get the next generation developers
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.020]   or how do you convert current developers
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.540]   into coming to your platform,
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:12.140]   having a better language that is more approachable
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.460]   is certainly a great way of doing it.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.660]   - Christina, did you talk to anybody
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:21.660]   who had considered the future integration prospects
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:25.740]   of Xamarin and Swift?
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.780]   - Xamarin, we should explain is the dot net clone created
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:30.300]   by Miguel. - Yes, model.
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:33.260]   - It was originally Mono by Miguel de Acaza.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.460]   And the company Xamarin, a lot of speculated
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:36.540]   that Microsoft might buy them,
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.900]   but that did not happen at Bill
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.540]   and I think may not happen at this point.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.940]   And it was a lot of cross platform dot net development.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.900]   - No, I hadn't, but I don't really know a lot of people
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:49.540]   who work in Xamarin or Mono or whatever.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.660]   But I think that, but that's a good point.
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.100]   I'll actually reach back out and see that changes anything.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.260]   But I should not talk to anybody.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.700]   But that would be really interesting
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.700]   to see how that'll work together.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.100]   I'm sure that the Xamarin will start incorporating Swift stuff.
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.940]   - Oh, they have to.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:06.100]   I mean, that's their whole reason for being
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:09.060]   is to integrate different languages
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.940]   so that no matter which language you use,
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.300]   you can use the same frameworks
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:16.860]   and you wind up with code that is portable.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:18.940]   - Currently, the tagline on their site
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:22.940]   is create native iOS, Android, Mac, and window absentee sharp.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:25.220]   So it'd be interesting to add Swift to them.
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:27.020]   - Yeah.
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:29.540]   - Let's take a break.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.260]   - We just, I mean, there's so much to talk about.
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.140]   - We got really geeky there for a little while.
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.220]   - Oh, geeky is good.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.260]   There's nothing wrong with geeky.
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:41.620]   I like it a geeky and we should say Visual Studio 14
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:42.540]   is almost ready.
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.460]   The first test build just came out.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.500]   I got a little argument 'cause I like Xcode.
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.900]   Somebody said, "Oh, Xcode's a horrible IDE."
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:51.300]   I said, "Well, it sure beats Eclipse,"
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:54.380]   which of course is what you use on Android.
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:56.060]   But I guess Visual Studio probably
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.540]   is the king of the hill on that.
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.380]   - Yeah.
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.460]   - No, no argument there.
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.300]   All right.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:04.060]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:08.020]   If you've got a new or maybe a not so new iPhone or iPad
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.660]   or a gadget that you wanna get rid of,
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:12.460]   maybe you've thinking of getting that new HTC One.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.180]   Oh, is that a sweet phone?
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:15.540]   Maybe you got a Moto X and you're gonna look
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:16.740]   for the Moto X plus one.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.620]   Go to Gazelle.com right now.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.780]   You can get a quote for your old gadget
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:22.700]   even before you stop using it.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.620]   Those quotes are good for 30 days
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:28.180]   and gives you plenty of time to wait for the announcement,
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:32.060]   wait for the new Amazon phone if that should come out.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.140]   And you'll get top dollar
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.140]   'cause I can tell you one thing,
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.460]   nothing in your closet, nothing in your pocket,
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.820]   nothing on your desk is gaining in value.
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:40.780]   All of this stuff depreciates rapidly.
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:43.020]   So get a quote on your old iPad,
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.740]   get a quote on your old iPhone or a Moto phone
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:48.420]   or maybe you've got a Surface tablet
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:49.980]   you'd like to get the new one.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:52.940]   Gazelle.com will even buy broken iPhones
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.260]   and broken phones of all kinds of tablets.
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.820]   Give you a top dollar for it.
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.580]   Give you 30 days to take advantage of it.
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:00.180]   Once you've got all your gadgets in there,
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:02.300]   you got cash sitting in those drawers.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:04.020]   Then you pull the trigger, you check out
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.580]   and they will send you a box prepaid postage
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:08.220]   so you don't have to play the postage.
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:09.340]   They'll turn it around fast
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:13.100]   and you'll get check PayPal or if you get an Amazon gift card
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.580]   and they're extra 5%, great for people to spend on Amazon.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:18.380]   I always get the Amazon gift card.
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:21.100]   It's totally risk free.
[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:23.700]   Gazelle has paid now more than $100 million
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.020]   to over 700,000 customers.
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:27.380]   They really are great.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:30.580]   They'll wipe your data if you can't wipe it yourself
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:32.860]   or you forget to, they take care of that.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.060]   Really, they're fine about that.
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:36.860]   I like Gazelle, I want you to try it.
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:39.100]   Those gadgets are not getting any more valuable
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:42.620]   and they're definitely like sitting on cash
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:43.940]   just to keep them in your drawers.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.340]   Not the way to do it.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:48.140]   Look, you can get your Nexus 7 out.
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.820]   67 bucks, actually that's not bad
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:53.220]   given that the Nexus 7 was only 200 bucks to begin with.
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:58.220]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com, the best way.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:02.540]   Sell your gadgets, simple, fast and easy.
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:08.420]   Well, if you were a 13 year old Ukrainian boy
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:13.420]   named Eugene Gustman,
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:18.460]   you might have taken this little thing called the Turing test.
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.740]   I love it that Bobby Llewellyn,
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:21.180]   who was a friend of this network,
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:24.260]   he plays Creighton, the robot in Red Dwarf
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:27.300]   and it does some great podcasts.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:29.740]   Was one of the judges in this.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:33.740]   The 60th anniversary yesterday of Alan Turing's death
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:37.300]   was commemorated by the Royal Society in London
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.420]   with a Turing test.
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:39.820]   Now you all know the Turing test.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.820]   The idea is if a computer can convince a human judge
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.140]   that it is a human itself,
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.900]   then it passes the Turing test.
[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:52.380]   Alan Turing conceived of this in the 50s.
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:57.460]   And I don't think any computer has ever passed the Turing test.
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:00.260]   But maybe it's fitting that it was on the 60th anniversary
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.780]   of Turing's death that Eugene Gustman
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:06.440]   fooled Robert Llewellyn and Lord Sharkey.
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:09.500]   Llewellyn tweeted, "Turing test was amazing.
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.340]   "Did 10 sessions of five minutes,
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.340]   "two screens, one human, one machine,
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.420]   "I guessed correctly, only four out of those 10 sessions.
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:19.420]   "Clever little robot fellow."
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:24.220]   - So it was 33% success ratio for the--
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.620]   - The Turing test. - For the robot, right?
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:29.500]   - Yeah, but that's enough to technically pass the test.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.300]   I don't know what it means.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.300]   In fact, the AI researchers I've talked to
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.980]   said it's a terrible test.
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:40.980]   - Well, Eliza was able to fool some researchers.
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:42.900]   - Yeah, not for very long.
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:44.780]   - In the days, well, yeah, not very many
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:45.700]   and not for very long.
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.980]   But still, the point is it's not a,
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:50.060]   it's a question of degree.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:51.460]   - Right.
[01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:54.580]   And this is, I'm sure this chatbot is something like Eliza,
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:55.540]   right?
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:57.060]   Unfortunately, Princeton's got it running,
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:59.620]   but I guess so many people are pounding on Eugene
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:01.340]   that I haven't been able to get in.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:02.420]   I really wanted to, yeah,
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:04.780]   I was really trying to ask some questions.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:06.540]   - Least Eugene alone.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:09.420]   - We wanna talk, the fictional Eugene
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:11.260]   as a father who's a gynecologist,
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.260]   he has a pet guinea pig.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:15.660]   If you ask him about it, he'll say things like,
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.300]   "My mom is always shouting that this dirty pig
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.100]   is a pig anyway, in spite it is a guinea pig
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:22.500]   and wants me to give it as a gift
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.420]   to any one of my friends for their birthday."
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:25.540]   Now that sounds like a bot to me,
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.020]   but remember he's supposed to be Ukrainian.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.420]   He hasn't speak English very well.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:33.100]   Three, he was created in 2001
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.300]   and he's been getting smarter ever since.
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:37.220]   (laughs)
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.780]   In 2012, he fooled 29% of the judges.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:44.260]   But I guess we can now say we have Eugene,
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:46.660]   the weirdest creature in the world.
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:49.020]   And as soon as the Princeton site is back up,
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:51.660]   you can bet I'm gonna be there chatting with him.
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:53.220]   - So he's like a real rolled version
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.340]   of the robot in AI,
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.160]   Haley Joel Osman's character in Steven's
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.060]   - Oh, wasn't that sad?
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.820]   You know, better than that though was her.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:06.820]   That was, I tell you, it sounded just like Scarlett Johansson.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.260]   - No spoilers yet.
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:09.500]   - Oh, you got to have it?
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:10.340]   - I haven't seen it.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.340]   It's probably next week.
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:13.660]   - It's so good.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:16.820]   Get it on your, get it on Xbox or I was gonna be.
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:17.900]   - You can rent it now.
[01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.580]   - But it's on Xbox as well.
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.220]   So, or Microsoft's movie store.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.140]   So.
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.380]   - It's not free on Netflix yet, but.
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:27.580]   - Yeah, won't be for years.
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:29.420]   - No, I'm willing to pay for it.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:32.980]   - I still pay for content.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:34.260]   - The only thing depressing to me
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:37.500]   is that we'll all be wearing high water pants in the future.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.300]   - Yeah, I got the fashions a little bit odd.
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:43.140]   But I love Spike Jones and it was,
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:43.980]   I've loved it.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:46.340]   I thought that was one of the best representations of AI.
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:48.020]   - Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Spike.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:49.580]   He hasn't made a bad movie.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:50.420]   - No.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:52.540]   - And apparently a Saturday Night Live
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:58.540]   did a parody of her with a character they called him.
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:01.420]   (laughing)
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.020]   Wait a minute, let me see if I can find this
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:05.420]   'cause this sounds good.
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.060]   Let's see if this is.
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.540]   - So, this will be good if actually
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.860]   a Saturday Night Live's kit was funny this year
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:13.260]   because it's been a bad year.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.700]   - Here's the parody.
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.580]   And if you've watched the movie, you'll kind of--
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:20.660]   - I still have a few questions.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:21.660]   - Actually, let me go back.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:22.500]   - Are you social?
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:25.460]   - 'Cause they get a guy that looks a little bit like
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.740]   a little bit like a piano reeves,
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:30.220]   not a piano reeves, river Phoenix.
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.540]   I'm not feeling--
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:33.020]   - Well, quatineviness.
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:33.860]   - Thank you.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.980]   - A artificially intelligent operating system.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:38.340]   We'd like to ask you a few questions.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.180]   - Okay.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:42.180]   Are you social or anti-social?
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:45.820]   - I guess I haven't been very social lately.
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:47.580]   - What do you like in other people?
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.300]   - It's kind of a hard question.
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.380]   I guess I don't get along very much like the movie.
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.300]   - Thank you.
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.980]   Please wait as your operating system is initiated.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:58.420]   - Hello.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:36:59.420]   Hey, what's up?
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:02.860]   - Oh, you sound like me.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:05.180]   - Oh, yeah, I guess I do.
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:06.100]   - It's general.
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:09.020]   - No, you actually have quite a lovely voice.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.780]   - Thanks, I like your voice too.
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:14.140]   It's very like a--
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:14.980]   - Thanks.
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:17.340]   - From the makers of her.
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:20.340]   - Sometimes I just feel really lonely.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.940]   - Sorry, this is boring.
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:24.060]   - Oh, I love listening to you.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:24.940]   - Really?
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:27.660]   - Yeah, you're like funny and great
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:29.340]   and your mustache is great.
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.300]   You're like an amazing mustache.
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:33.180]   - Me.
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.020]   (laughing)
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.460]   - I love those pants.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:37.460]   - You sure they aren't too high?
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:38.460]   - No, honestly,
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:39.820]   I think you're higher.
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:42.900]   (laughing)
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.140]   - Story of Patch.
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:45.780]   - That was a net room this year.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.140]   I wish I could touch you.
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:48.420]   - Pretty much this is her.
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:49.260]   - Touch me.
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:50.100]   - Shut up.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.100]   - I can't.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:51.940]   - Don't be shy.
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:54.220]   - I say, well, I guess I'd start--
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:58.060]   - Maybe we should pause here and let the rest of you
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:37:59.580]   watch this at home in private.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:01.820]   (laughing)
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:05.620]   I like Jonil.
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:06.980]   - The narcissism factor is--
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:07.820]   - Great.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.100]   - Spot on.
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.740]   - Do you think, okay, Ed, do you have to live that out of this,
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:14.020]   but this is just between me and film girl.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:14.860]   - Okay.
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:16.180]   - Do you think we will live in a world like that
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.020]   sometime that where we,
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.460]   I feel like that's just around the corner
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:21.540]   where an operating system actually sounds like a human.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:22.380]   - Oh, totally.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:24.060]   I mean, I've always, it's like every year
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.780]   we get closer and closer to minority reform.
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:27.620]   And--
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:30.180]   - I don't care about waving around screens.
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.020]   I wanna--
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:31.860]   - No, I know.
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.660]   - I want Scarlett Johansson to talk to me on my computer.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:35.300]   - Right, no, I mean, which would be great.
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.820]   I mean, I would listen to ScarJo.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.820]   I wouldn't listen to Sean Penn,
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:42.020]   but I would certainly have a ScarJo.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:42.860]   - Who would you?
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.020]   - So, okay, no, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:45.220]   - But you would wanna--
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.220]   - Clooney.
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.060]   - Clooney.
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:47.900]   - Clooney.
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:48.740]   - Hi.
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:49.580]   Hey, girl.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:50.580]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:51.420]   (laughing)
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:52.420]   I just like--
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:53.900]   - He's got a nice voice, yeah, I agree.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:54.740]   - He's got a great voice.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:56.740]   And then you could just tell that he's, you know.
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:57.580]   - A nice guy.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.340]   - Maybe he'll settle down with the right girl, you know?
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:01.660]   I mean, maybe if she's French and something special,
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:03.140]   like maybe he'll settle down.
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.060]   I would totally pick Clue.
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:05.260]   - You have a shot, yeah.
[01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:07.340]   (laughing)
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:08.180]   - I don't know.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.780]   I suppose it's supposed to be a cautionary tale,
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:13.540]   because, I mean, really, these people get sucked in
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:16.460]   by their devices and spend a lot of time looking.
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:17.460]   - I was gonna say, you know--
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:18.620]   - Green, just wait a minute.
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.540]   - Right, I was like, are we not already there yet?
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:21.780]   - I didn't know we were there.
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:25.220]   - We had nobody in the viewership of this program, Leo.
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.060]   - No!
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:26.900]   - No!
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:29.940]   - Hey, if you missed anything on Twit this week,
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:32.500]   you missed some really good stuff, but fortunately,
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.540]   we've cut it all into a small bundle
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:37.740]   and you can digest easily right now.
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:41.340]   - Previously on Twit, Twit Live Specials.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.020]   - What Apple showed today is the advantage
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.340]   of owning the whole system.
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.700]   - I think if you're a developer,
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.100]   you understand the Apple ecosystem,
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:49.740]   you can see what a massive announcement this was.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:51.220]   - Almost everything they talked about
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:53.300]   was laying a powerful groundwork.
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:54.420]   You know, look at the health stuff,
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:57.580]   look at the home automation stuff for entire industries
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.860]   to build the Apple ecosystem into something much more powerful.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.260]   - Tech news today.
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:03.940]   - International Telecom Giant Vodafone
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:05.420]   is set in a report today that governments
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:07.820]   have direct access to the company's infrastructure.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:09.460]   - Waiting between the lines of the report,
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.300]   Vodafone calling for an end
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:14.020]   to their six countries have secret cables,
[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:17.460]   which can sign off any data that the governments want.
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:18.660]   - Matt break weekly.
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:20.700]   - No hardware, zero.
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:24.220]   This was 4,000 new APIs, a host of new functionality.
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.220]   They didn't need any of that.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.140]   They didn't need new hardware.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.940]   They didn't need new devices, nothing.
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.980]   - The subtext of this keynote is Andy Police
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:31.460]   switched back to iOS.
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:32.900]   - Marketing Mavericks.
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:35.420]   - So as a CEO, what would you do differently
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.740]   if you were the CEO of Best Buy?
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.780]   - The question to ask is always,
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:43.220]   if a company didn't exist, would you have to invent it?
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.380]   - If you missed Twit this week, you missed a lot.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:47.980]   - And Andy, they're saying your Skype
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.060]   is particularly clear today, so that's nice.
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:51.900]   That's a while we get ready.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:53.020]   - It's gonna be so weird not to have Skype
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.660]   to blame for my misjudgments.
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.340]   (laughing)
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:59.260]   - That was a lot of fun having all the Mac break weekly hosts
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:04.260]   in studio on Monday for the WWDC announcement.
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:05.700]   - But we got a big week coming up.
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.680]   Mike Elgin of TNT has this story.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:11.700]   - Coming up this week, Bloomberg's next big thing summit
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:14.540]   begins Monday, June 9th in Sausoleto, California.
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:16.660]   E3 Expo starts Tuesday, June 10th
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:18.060]   at the Los Angeles Convention Center,
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:20.700]   and Samsung is holding an event in New York City
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:24.580]   on Thursday, June 12th called Galaxy Premier 2014.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.420]   We're expecting some new Galaxy tab tablets.
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:28.300]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:29.140]   - Thank you, Mike Elgin.
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:30.620]   This has been a crazy month.
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:33.380]   Starts with WWDC, Samsung.
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:36.100]   There's some Amazon thing coming up on the 18th,
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.260]   and then of course Google I/O,
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:39.780]   and Google will get to kind of put the period on this.
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:42.380]   I imagine Google will respond in some way,
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:45.940]   not directly to what Apple announced.
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:48.900]   Any thoughts about Google I/O coming up?
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:50.100]   - I wanna see more wearables.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:50.980]   I'm really excited.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:54.140]   I'm expecting to see maybe the official unveiling
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.540]   of the first two, Android Wear.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:58.620]   - Is it even see the Moto 360?
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:41:59.900]   - I think we'll see that in the G-Watch.
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:00.740]   I think we'll see both of them.
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.060]   - That'd be cool.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:07.060]   So what is this thing Amazon is announcing on June 18th?
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:12.100]   I think it's their 3D phone that was rumored earlier this year.
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:15.100]   Is-- - Sounds about right.
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.860]   - But why?
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:21.380]   - It's weird, and I don't even think press invites have gone out.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:22.700]   I mean, it's one of those weird things
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:24.300]   where I think they had like a sign up or something.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.140]   Like I mean-- - They do.
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:26.900]   - Anybody can get an invitation.
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:29.180]   - Oh, they're allowing, yeah, they're right.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:30.860]   You wanna go sign up.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:32.420]   - In fact, it was on the front page.
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.420]   - Are you gonna go?
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.980]   - Look, it's on the front page of Amazon.
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.300]   You go to Amazon.com.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:38.180]   Want an invite to our new unveiling?
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:41.020]   Hey, everybody's the press now.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:42.420]   I think that you think they'll just
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:45.580]   as shoe press invitations.
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:48.340]   They do give you the chance to create your own video
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.180]   saying why you should go.
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:52.700]   Let me show you the video though.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:54.380]   This is really weird.
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:56.980]   That they attached.
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:58.380]   - That is awesome.
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.060]   - Will you freeze frame it at the spot
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:01.740]   where they accidentally show the things?
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.020]   - Yes, I will.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:04.020]   - Whoa.
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:05.100]   - That's really cool.
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.260]   - It's amazing.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:09.220]   - It's very real life and un-compairable
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.340]   to anything I've seen.
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.980]   - I've never seen anything like this.
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:12.940]   - Yeah, this is neat.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:14.580]   This is really neat.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:16.500]   - I don't think I've ever seen anything like that.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:18.300]   - Oh my gosh, that's crazy.
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.940]   - That's super awesome.
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:22.180]   I don't know how you guys do it.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:24.020]   It's pretty flawless and seamless.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:24.860]   - Wow.
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:26.180]   - As well as it was really cool.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:27.580]   - How does it do that?
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:28.940]   - Glasses free 3D.
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:30.260]   - That's pretty.
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:31.700]   - You think that's what it is?
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.180]   - Yeah.
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:34.380]   - Pretty damn intuitive.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:35.460]   - Now it's really cool.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.340]   I would use that a lot.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:37.500]   - Here come the glasses.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:38.860]   - Really cool.
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:39.780]   - Okay.
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:40.620]   That.
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:41.900]   (laughs)
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:43.340]   If you zoom in,
[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:45.540]   setter, enhance, zoom,
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:48.300]   you can see something.
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:49.340]   Definitely looks like a phone.
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:50.700]   It's too small to be a tablet.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.180]   That's probably a phone.
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:53.540]   - And you can see the back plate of it
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.820]   in the signup sheet.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:56.660]   - Yeah.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:01.180]   - Well, actually, and Business Insider did a freeze frame
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:04.060]   of that, I thought it was that same video
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:07.060]   where they had cut down to that woman
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:08.820]   and you could see the top of the thing
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:10.380]   she's holding in her hand,
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.940]   which was clearly a smartphone.
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.100]   - Yeah.
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:18.100]   - Why would I want a glasses free 3D smartphone?
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:20.300]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.780]   I mean, it's better than having to have glasses.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:24.220]   - I mean, with LG.
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:25.580]   - Yeah, but I don't.
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:26.900]   - No, I agree, but I don't know.
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:28.500]   - We've seen 3D phones before.
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:29.660]   I don't, okay, let's.
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.460]   - Right, but you had to use glasses with LG one.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:32.900]   I mean, still 3D is weird.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.140]   I don't get it, but I'm, I don't know.
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:35.980]   - I'm with you.
[01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:36.820]   - It's easier to touch things.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:37.660]   I don't get it.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.540]   - Well, Christina, that's because you're old.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:40.380]   - Yeah.
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:41.700]   - Oh, yes!
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:42.540]   - Absolutely.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:43.380]   - Absolutely.
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:45.460]   I'm clearly, I'm feeling my age now
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:46.700]   because I don't get it,
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:47.900]   but I don't really get 3D.
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.940]   So I think you do the,
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:50.820]   in the movie theater I do,
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:52.060]   but I don't really get like.
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:54.660]   You kids, you watch everything in 3D.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.460]   I don't understand it.
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.300]   Two people have.
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:58.140]   - Two people have.
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:00.140]   - Two people have for me and my kids.
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.900]   - Now, if it had holograms,
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:02.980]   the whole experience was like,
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.700]   I had a whole number of my products.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:06.060]   - Aren't we going for more immersive?
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:07.380]   I mean, if we could get more immersive,
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:08.820]   look at the Oculus Rift and,
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:09.660]   - Which is awesome.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:11.100]   - If we could get it more immersive,
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.500]   like you're like, you're really there.
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.500]   Okay, but this is a phone.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.380]   To me, I'm surprised Amazon's not pushing other things.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:20.860]   Like, for instance, they could make this very low cost
[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:22.420]   or even free because.
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:24.220]   - Well, they're not pushing anything yet, Leo.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:25.620]   This is a teaser video.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:26.860]   - Oh. - There's no,
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:28.020]   there's no content in it.
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:30.340]   You won't know until you get there on the 18th.
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:31.180]   - Okay.
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:34.660]   - What it is, all you're doing is going on rumor sites.
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:35.980]   - I'm not even going on rumor sites.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:39.020]   All I see is people going like this with their heads.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:39.860]   - That's awesome.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:41.540]   I mean, yeah, I was like, oh, it looks like it's really there.
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:42.540]   - How do you do it?
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:45.820]   - Now, the funny thing is,
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:48.100]   watch that video with the sound off.
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:48.940]   - Oh, okay.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:49.780]   Let's try it now.
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:53.700]   - Then they really look dorky, right?
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:54.700]   No sound.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:55.780]   All right, let's repeat.
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:57.500]   No.
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:00.860]   (humming)
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:04.500]   I like the part where he's going, this guy.
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.540]   - They're all looking down.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:08.500]   - They're all looking down, yeah.
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.340]   (laughing)
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.540]   - Oh, at their...
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.380]   - Yeah.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:12.220]   - Oh, geez.
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:16.060]   - Oh, my, oh, wow, that's big.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.380]   It's round.
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:18.220]   Wow.
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.460]   (laughing)
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.940]   (laughing)
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:23.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:27.540]   (laughing)
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:30.460]   Say hello to my little friend.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.180]   - What can I say?
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:33.340]   (laughing)
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:36.460]   - You've got a dirty mind, Mr. Bak.
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:40.420]   - I have to confess it's Joanna Stern.
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:41.740]   - Oh, really?
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:43.100]   - Oh, Joanna, I love you so much.
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:43.940]   That's something that's--
[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:45.780]   - Oh, that's the first thing Joanna thought of us.
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:47.940]   - She's the one who suggested that
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:52.940]   and Joanna deserves all the props for that.
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.620]   - That's amazing.
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:58.540]   - So you're looking at all the props right now.
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:46:59.860]   - Yes, it's the props.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:03.980]   All right, what could Amazon do in the phone business
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.740]   that would make it compelling?
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:07.460]   Look, there's a lot of competition.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:09.700]   - Well, look, they've got, they've got,
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:12.620]   they have tablets, they have an amazing ecosystem
[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:17.620]   and phones are the essential part of a mobile ecosystem
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:19.100]   experience.
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:23.060]   So they need to be there with a Kindle Fire phone.
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:24.060]   - Okay.
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:25.860]   - Here's my only question.
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:27.420]   - And that's there.
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:29.340]   And that's there.
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:31.860]   So their thing has also been,
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:34.340]   we'll do Android without Google.
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:36.340]   - Right, it is Android, but no Google.
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:37.180]   Yeah.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:41.100]   - And our store is big enough for people
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:42.740]   to put apps there.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:48.940]   - So, go ahead.
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:50.460]   - No, I was just gonna say, I totally am with you,
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.100]   but I understand why like the Kindle Fire tablets
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:55.420]   make sense and what the Fire TV makes sense.
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:56.780]   I mean, at least in the US,
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:59.900]   Amazon's content ecosystem is arguably more powerful
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:01.700]   and easier to use than Google is when it comes to things
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:04.180]   like music and movies and books.
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.940]   And that works great on a tablet or on a Fire TV,
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:09.540]   but on a phone, you need email, you need a web browser,
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:11.460]   you need search.
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:13.180]   And they don't really do those things
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:14.340]   and they don't really do them that well.
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:15.660]   - Well, they have to soak a browser.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.420]   It's not-- - Yeah, but it's terrible.
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:19.700]   So like, what do you do about how can,
[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:21.180]   but they can't put the Gmail app in there
[01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:23.180]   and that's what a lot of people want for their phone.
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:25.380]   So what's the benefit of getting--
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:29.820]   - Is Android without Google services as compelling?
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:31.780]   - On a phone, I would say on a tablet, it's fine,
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:34.260]   but on a phone, like I need my Gmail,
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.100]   like I've got to use it-- - I want to use it.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.660]   I want to use it for free access.
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:38.100]   - I love my Kindle Fire, but I'm saying I don't know
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.860]   if I want to use a phone where I don't have the Chrome browser,
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.340]   especially if it's Android based and I don't have the Gmail app.
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:46.100]   Like that's sort of the whole reason you put up
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:48.380]   with the crummy Android overall experiences
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:49.980]   because the Google services are so good.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:52.780]   - I am glad that there is somebody like Amazon out there
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:56.580]   that can challenge the incumbents and create.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:58.140]   So they will cover it June 18th.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:59.500]   They haven't announced the time.
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.820]   So I don't know how we'll cover it.
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:03.900]   It may overlap with some of our other shows.
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:05.180]   We do a lot of shows on Wednesday,
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:07.500]   but assuming it's in the morning,
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.180]   we'll be able to cover it on Tech News time.
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:11.020]   - It'll be at five AM.
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:15.540]   So they'll be able to get it to you with a drone the same day.
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.940]   - I was gonna say, the drone's got to be part of this.
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.660]   Like maybe it's like remote control if you're a drone
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:21.620]   that's in 3D with gesture based stuff.
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:24.260]   Like the-- - Speculate on will it be
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:26.900]   carrier independent, will it be unlocked,
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:28.900]   or will they have carrier deals?
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.460]   When will it be available?
[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:31.620]   How much will it cost?
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:36.540]   - If they don't have carrier deals, they're in trouble.
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:37.620]   - Okay.
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:39.220]   'Cause you have to sell it subsidized.
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:40.220]   - Right, because--
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:42.100]   - And nobody's-- - People don't put in sim chips.
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:43.340]   They don't go, "Oh." - No, they don't.
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:44.500]   - Right. - I mean, the next is,
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:48.820]   the relative lack of success of the next is smartphones
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.820]   proves you need to have carrier support.
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:52.020]   You need to have them in the source.
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:52.860]   - You have to buy from the carrier.
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:53.900]   - So I think you have to have carrier support.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:55.940]   And they have a really good retail presence already
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:57.260]   with the Kindle stuff,
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:49:58.860]   so I don't think that would be hard.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:03.860]   Price, I mean, they're willing to subsidize stuff
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:05.740]   pretty low, so I mean, I think that if they--
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.660]   - Jeff has always said, "We make money when you use it,
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:08.660]   not when you buy it."
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:09.500]   - Exactly.
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:12.380]   - Yeah, so if you're an Amazon Prime customer,
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:16.460]   you'll get an amazing price on this thing, I would expect.
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:17.540]   And the one thing that I had,
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:19.540]   one piece of speculation that I heard,
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:22.580]   I wish I knew who to credit with this,
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:26.260]   but I can't remember, so remind me someone.
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:30.700]   But someone speculated that perhaps they'll figure out a way
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:35.700]   to deliver free 4G or LTE data to it.
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:38.780]   An amount that's big enough.
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:40.980]   Now, that's not unheard of.
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:44.140]   - Now you can get 200 megabytes now on many devices.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:45.540]   - Right, like Wispernet or whatever.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:48.460]   - Yeah, the original Kindle had Wispernet.
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:50.620]   And they've had deals, I think that deal was with
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:53.140]   Sprint and P-level, which was Sprint.
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:55.300]   - Sprint and then I think now it's AT&T, I think.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:56.220]   - Yes, it's Swiss.
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:59.460]   - Yeah, and so it's entirely possible
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:03.660]   that they could be both buying some data packages
[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:07.540]   from a provider and make that part of the thing.
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:12.060]   You know, so that you have an entertainment device
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:16.620]   that's also capable of doing communication of sorts.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:21.620]   But I don't know, I'm as curious and skeptical
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:24.460]   as anybody about what this is going to be.
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:25.460]   - They didn't, with the Fire TV,
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:27.980]   they didn't really make any, to put differentiators in.
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:30.020]   It plays games, I guess is one differentiator,
[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:33.060]   but it's basically like a Roku or anything else, right?
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:34.900]   - Yeah, but it plays games that's a big differentiator.
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:37.700]   And it has the voice search, that's the other thing.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.660]   The voice search is really good.
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.300]   But yeah, I mean, I think basically,
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:42.660]   yeah, I mean, that those are the two things.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:45.260]   So I'm with it, I'm very curious,
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:48.860]   but I'm also like, I don't quite understand.
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.500]   But I'm a huge Amazon fan, so I don't wanna write off
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:53.940]   the idea that an Amazon phone couldn't be compelling.
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.780]   I just kind of don't see the use case right now,
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:56.980]   but that doesn't mean that I won't,
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:00.020]   because they've surprised me in the past.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:02.780]   - Well, if they're selling a phone,
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:06.020]   they'll maybe one fewer carrier to subsidize it.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:09.460]   Bloomberg is reporting that the merger
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:12.060]   between Sprint and T-Mobile is imminent,
[01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:15.020]   the company will be renamed SoftBankUSA,
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.780]   SoftBank owns Sprint,
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:20.460]   and that T-Mobile CEO John Ledger
[01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:22.620]   will run the newly merged company.
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:23.620]   - Good.
[01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:26.980]   - Yeah, he is the bright spot at T-Mobile.
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:28.780]   He's turned that company around,
[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:30.300]   and you could argue that Dan Hesse
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.100]   at Sprint has done the opposite.
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:34.100]   - Oh, Dan Hesse is awful, but--
[01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:37.540]   - Don't mince words there, Christine, amen.
[01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:41.380]   - Well, I'm sorry, his commercials alone were like,
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:43.660]   I mean, Sprint is, whatever,
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:45.300]   but what's interesting I think is that,
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:48.540]   SoftBank will be buying T-Mobile from Duet's telecom,
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:50.380]   and then keeping the two divisions
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:53.460]   run separately to prevent, I guess, antitrust things,
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:55.980]   which makes sense, then maybe at one point, merge them.
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:58.500]   But John Ledger, the T-Mobile CEO,
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.380]   he is my favorite CEO right now.
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:01.580]   Like, I love him so much.
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:02.900]   He doesn't mince words.
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:05.380]   His public appearances are always fantastic.
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:08.900]   He's always witty, and they've made some really, really good moves
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:11.420]   that have kind of brought the company back.
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.300]   I mean, the only thing that they're missing
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:16.220]   is a really compelling network.
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:18.300]   They are still just in little pockets,
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:19.260]   which would curse them.
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:21.020]   - So would they have to unify networks
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:22.820]   to make this make sense?
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:25.180]   - Yeah, but they could maybe do that by doing share,
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:27.820]   which is kind of what happened, like, you know,
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:30.900]   the upfront and used to do a lot of like,
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:34.740]   MVNOs with, you know, like Metro PCS used the Sprint network,
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:36.300]   and then, you know, T-Mobile brought them.
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.740]   It's possible that they could maybe expand
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:40.180]   and do spectrum sharing deals.
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.940]   So even though they're two separate companies,
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.900]   but two separate books, maybe they use the same space.
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:45.900]   - That's so flue-chee-y.
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.220]   That's so flue-chee-y.
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:48.580]   - But I mean, but if you think about it--
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:50.500]   - But you've got to get a past regulatory approval.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:53.020]   - Right, I was going to say, if the FTC is not going to approve it,
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:55.540]   and the main reason I think the FTC would face,
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:57.820]   well, and the FCC for that matter would face challenges
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:00.860]   is because Sprint wanted to buy T-Mobile when AT&T bid.
[01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:03.060]   And so they got butt-heard that they got out bid.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:06.860]   And so they used the fact that we need for carriers,
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:07.980]   three carriers is not enough.
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.860]   Like, that was the cornerstone of their argument
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:11.460]   to prevent that deal from going through.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:14.940]   So how do you then argue a few years later that,
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:16.740]   no, no, really three carriers is fine.
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:20.020]   It just wasn't okay when it was the other guy who outbid us.
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:22.740]   - I think that argument's pretty easy, actually,
[01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:27.500]   because in every other aspect of our modern tech life,
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:30.340]   we're down to one or two choices for everything.
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:32.460]   So three-- - Three is big.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.740]   - Three? - Three is big.
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:35.100]   - Three is big. - No, it's okay.
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:36.940]   - Well, we're happy to have three.
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:41.820]   And actually, when AT&T, when you're dealing with a duopoly
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:44.380]   of AT&T and Verizon, who basically--
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:46.260]   - Which were AT&T?
[01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:50.420]   - Are carving up the market as they wish.
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:52.380]   - Like Time Warner and Comcast.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:53.220]   - Right. - Yeah.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:56.100]   - Well, I mean, in both of them are former AT&T subsidiaries,
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:58.020]   which is the funny thing, they're both baby bells.
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:54:59.580]   It was singular and--
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:02.740]   - Show where they're one, right?
[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:03.740]   - Or Bell Atlantic. - The Bell Atlantic, yeah.
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:05.100]   - The Bell Atlantic and Bell South,
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:06.100]   which then became singular.
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:08.580]   Those are-- - Wait, so does this make this--
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:10.420]   I'm trying to remember my high school biology.
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:12.220]   Does this make this meiosis?
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:15.420]   Are all of the cells all coming back together now?
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:16.580]   - Exactly.
[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:20.220]   I really think that that's been what AT&T,
[01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:21.780]   through whatever naming convention you want to use,
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:24.540]   has been trying to do since deregulation hit.
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:25.820]   They've been trying to do everything they can
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:28.260]   to come back together, and they're almost there.
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.620]   So, yeah, I mean, I'm with you.
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:30.860]   I see the argument for three.
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:33.780]   I'm just saying, I think it presents political challenges
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:36.780]   when you spend so much time and effort lobbying for four,
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:38.860]   especially if you're a foreign company, like SoftBank,
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:41.020]   but at least through Japanese, not Chinese, right?
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:42.260]   - It's a little different, though,
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:43.820]   than AT&T, trying to buy T-Mobile,
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:46.420]   which regulators put the kibosh on in 2011.
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:47.420]   - Right, no, it is.
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:50.700]   - Because you've got the two weak parties,
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:52.420]   and they can make the argument,
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:54.540]   both Sprint and T-Mobile, that, hey,
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:58.700]   you need to let us merge, 'cause we both can't succeed.
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:00.300]   - No, I think that's very fair.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:01.620]   I mean, you know, Ingeuys Telecom
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:03.700]   has been trying to get rid of T-Mobile.
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:06.820]   Basically, for almost, God, I don't even know how long,
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:08.740]   I mean, they actively were trying to unload--
[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:09.740]   - They have another problem.
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:11.820]   One is CDMA, one is GSM.
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:14.100]   - Well, but that's not as big a problem as you would think.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.580]   It's really more about the spectrum buys,
[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:18.340]   because Sprint, after Ymax, Crash and Burn,
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.780]   thank you, Dan Hesse, in their face,
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:20.980]   and it was a colossal failure.
[01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:21.820]   - Clear wire.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:24.540]   - They switched to, yeah, Clear Wire,
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:27.540]   but they called it Ymax, but since that Crash and Burned,
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:29.060]   they've started to shift to LTE,
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:31.220]   and as part of the--
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.900]   - Everything's LTE that it doesn't matter.
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.380]   - Right, and it will have been more than that.
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:36.900]   I mean, T-Mobile got a lot of AT&T spectrum
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:38.180]   because that yield didn't go through.
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:43.180]   - Six billion dollars in cancellation fees from AT&T.
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:44.180]   - Right, right, so they got that,
[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:47.500]   plus they got access to some of AT&T's LTE spectrum blocks.
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:50.260]   So they're actually running close with the same frequencies.
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:54.940]   And so if you look at that, as everything goes LTE,
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:56.220]   that's not gonna be as big of a problem.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.460]   The problem, of course, is that actually Sprint
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:01.500]   has the smallest LTE blanket of anybody,
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.860]   so they still have to rely on CDMA.
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:05.860]   That wouldn't mean you couldn't sell new phones.
[01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:08.980]   It only worked in LTE, maybe in specific markets.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:10.300]   Maybe you don't sell it everywhere,
[01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:13.300]   but if it's a market that has LTE access,
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:15.540]   you can do it and then it would like maybe backbone
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:18.140]   to whatever T-Mobile's GSM offering is,
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:20.740]   which is pretty robust, it's slow, but it's robust.
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:22.220]   - It's not only that.
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:24.220]   - So this is Masayoshi Son.
[01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:25.860]   - Yes, Sun San.
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:28.220]   We knew him well at ZD that.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:30.220]   - I have, we have both worked.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:31.900]   - We've worked for him.
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:34.060]   - Leo, we've got all the tech, all the us old guys.
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:35.940]   We've all worked for Sun San.
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:39.140]   At some point, he has 500 year plans.
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:42.500]   - Let me also point out that he announced just last week
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:46.300]   that they are making emotional robots
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:49.140]   and Softbank said they will go on sale in February
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:51.060]   for under $2,000.
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:56.060]   Pepper is its name and the robots will be staffing stores,
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:58:00.060]   Softbank stores, as well as watching your baby,
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:04.420]   Sun San is a work, a piece of work.
[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:05.260]   - A piece of work.
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:06.180]   - It's amazing.
[01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:07.020]   I want Pepper.
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:09.860]   I still have an IBO, remember Sun San is talking about a dog?
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:11.380]   - I need an IBO.
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:13.860]   - I need a touring test for that.
[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:15.140]   - You wanna meet Pepper?
[01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:15.980]   - Oh, here you go.
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:16.820]   - Oh, I want Pepper.
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:17.660]   - Here's Pepper.
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:21.140]   Hi, I'm Pepper.
[01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:25.300]   I have an English accent for no apparent reason.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:27.900]   And I have eyes that don't work.
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:32.060]   But I am able to articulate my joints.
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:34.300]   Roll around and boogie-woogie.
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:36.860]   Look at my butt.
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:39.180]   Why do I have one?
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:40.220]   No one knows.
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:41.660]   I can't sit down on it.
[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:46.540]   Maybe it just makes you feel better about me.
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:48.380]   What is he directing traffic?
[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:49.660]   - I guess so.
[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:51.340]   I love this guy on iPad on his stomach.
[01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:52.180]   That's so cute.
[01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:54.740]   (laughing)
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:58.700]   - Pepper is four feet tall, 62 pounds.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:01.740]   Tablets style display on its chest.
[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:02.580]   - Tablets style.
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:03.740]   - Tablets style.
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:09.740]   And apparently he speaks Japanese, 12 hours battery life.
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:14.660]   - I wonder if they named it after Pepper in the Iron Man movies.
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:15.500]   That would be funny.
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:16.340]   - Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:17.740]   - Like Tony Stark's companion.
[01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:19.660]   That would be so great.
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:20.500]   But I want one.
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:23.220]   If it was under $2,000, I'm totally kidding.
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:24.860]   - I bought that stupid segue
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:27.500]   that rolls your iPad around for $2,500.
[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:29.700]   - I was gonna say, I bought an I-bow.
[01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:31.180]   You know, I was in college when I got my I-bow.
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:32.740]   - Well, does it include the iPad?
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.180]   I mean, if it includes the iPad,
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:35.740]   you can actually make a piece for it.
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:37.700]   - It is not an iPad at 16.9,
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:38.860]   I think it's something else.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:40.060]   - It is, it's something.
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:42.300]   - It's a tablet-like display.
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:44.780]   - Well, it's obviously not a Surface Pro 3 either.
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:46.140]   - No, it's a Surface RT.
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:48.060]   No, it's a Surface RT, Ed, because they couldn't,
[01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:48.940]   they couldn't, no, it's not.
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:51.060]   I'm joking, I'm saying that they couldn't get rid of all those.
[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:52.900]   - This is where they found, this is the market.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:55.500]   They were able to get an incredible deal on them.
[01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:56.700]   They went out to the,
[01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:59.220]   there was the, right next to the Atari Dig.
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:00.460]   (laughing)
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:02.580]   - Right, so all the Surface RT Dig.
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:04.780]   - You get a free eT cartridge with every robot.
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:05.900]   It's a great thing.
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:07.740]   Our show brought to you by Stamps.com.
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:09.500]   I drove by the post office the other day
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:11.100]   and I waved as I drove by.
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.420]   It's a, in Petaluma, it's beautiful old edifice.
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:17.220]   And I have a great, I have a really strong feeling of,
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:19.620]   I don't know, affection for the mail carrier,
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:20.900]   for the post office.
[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:22.660]   When I was a kid, it always meant something good
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:23.860]   was coming in the mail.
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:26.140]   But God knows, as you get a business
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:27.900]   and you start doing mailing in your business,
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:30.660]   whether it's bills or flyers or fulfillment,
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:33.220]   maybe you're selling Etsy or Amazon,
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:37.100]   the post office becomes this kind of nightmare in your eyes.
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:39.220]   Somewhere you gotta go, you gotta buy Stamps,
[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:41.420]   you gotta stand behind the little old lady
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:43.980]   who's mailing 18 packages to her grandchildren.
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:46.020]   It's just not fun anymore.
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:49.940]   Fortunately, Stamps.com lets you do anything you would do
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:52.780]   at the post office, right from your desk, right at work.
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:56.940]   24/7, full time on demand access, not just a postage.
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:59.860]   And by the way, yes, you could print your own official US
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:01.580]   postage from your computer and your printer.
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:03.700]   You don't need anything special, no postage meter,
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:05.140]   no special links.
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:07.580]   But it's a whole lot more.
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:10.740]   Stamps.com will take addresses from your address book,
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:12.340]   from your QuickBooks, from your Etsy site
[02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:15.420]   or your Amazon or eBay site, automatically fill them in.
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:17.420]   It'll fill in the international mailing forms.
[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:19.860]   It gets you discounts on all kinds of mail
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:21.980]   that you just can't even get at the post office.
[02:01:21.980 --> 02:01:24.340]   It's really all about doing the fulfillment.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:26.260]   They even have a USB scale, and I'm gonna show you
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:27.980]   how you can get that for free,
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:30.540]   that will allow you to fully automate it
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:32.780]   so you're always paying exactly the right amount.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:34.260]   Even when the postage changes,
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:35.980]   it just happens on stamps.com.
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:37.460]   And then the mail carrier comes.
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:39.700]   In fact, there's even a button in stamps.com's interface
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:41.420]   that says, get the mail carrier out here.
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:44.140]   So even if you missed the first pickup,
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:46.060]   you can schedule another one free.
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:49.500]   Stamps.com, you can get discounted package insurance.
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:52.020]   All with one click, I want you to try it.

[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:05.580]   in the upper right hand corner,

[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:20.540]   You just pay shipping and handling on that.
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:21.580]   That's five bucks.
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:23.580]   They'll make it up to you with a $5 supply kit.

[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:40.700]   The anniversary of Tetris 30 years ago today,
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:43.940]   surely Christina, you did not play Tetris
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:45.460]   when you were five years old.
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:50.020]   - No, I got a Game Boy, so I was only like one
[02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:52.700]   when the game was released, but I played,
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:54.900]   I got a Game Boy when I was seven.
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:56.660]   And I used to play Tetris on it so much
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:59.020]   that I would dream and Tetris ride.
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:01.620]   - That's it, help win.
[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:03.580]   - Apparently though, that's actually not uncommon.
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:04.420]   There's something cool. - Oh yeah.
[02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:06.020]   - I can't think of the name of it, but there's apparently,
[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:08.940]   it's like a phenomenon that they named after Tetris
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:11.580]   where people play types of games that they see,
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:13.180]   you know, the pieces in the box.
[02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:14.700]   - You see blocks, yeah.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:16.060]   - Yeah, and you dream about it.
[02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:17.020]   And that would happen.
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.620]   I love Tetris so much.
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:21.060]   That is, if I have to think about like one game
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:23.900]   or one puzzle game I could play for the rest of my life,
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:24.740]   it would be that would be Jules.
[02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:26.140]   And I think Tetris would probably win.
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:27.620]   - Oh, I love Bejeweled too.
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:30.660]   It's all pattern matching, right?
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:31.740]   - Yeah.
[02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:33.300]   - Tetris is available on every platform,
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:36.140]   originally written by a guy from Russia.
[02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:36.980]   - Yeah.
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:39.340]   - Alexei Pajitnov, I interviewed him
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:41.140]   when he first came to the United States as English
[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:42.860]   as very poor, very strong Russian accent.
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:45.700]   And I say, Alexei, what did you get paid
[02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:49.700]   for the rights to distribute Tetris in the United States?
[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:51.780]   And he said, they give me IBM PC.
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:53.660]   - So that's it?
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:55.860]   - He said yes, they was very happy.
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:58.860]   In Moscow, in the Soviet Union in 1984,
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:02.500]   an IBM PC was like solid gold.
[02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:08.620]   And by 1988, Tetris was everywhere.
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:12.500]   He was, I really liked Alexei.
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:14.740]   Really was an interesting guy, very sweet guy.
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:17.300]   And never did make a huge amount of money off of Tetris,
[02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:20.660]   but he did create an amazing thing.
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:24.620]   In fact, eventually the Soviet Union took over Tetris.
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:25.460]   And...
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:26.500]   (laughing)
[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:29.420]   - Seriously, they're the ones that Atari paid
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:30.260]   for the rights to...
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:31.100]   - The people's...
[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:31.940]   - Right, well, it was Harry paid
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:34.700]   and then ended up having to bury those cartridges
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:35.660]   in the desert.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:40.380]   Well, no, because the Tengen version of Tetris for the NES
[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:43.020]   was ruled illegal that it wasn't officially licensed.
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:44.500]   - 'Cause they didn't license it, right.
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:47.740]   - Right, they got it from the Soviet Union licensed it
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:48.780]   to somebody for the Tandy,
[02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:52.140]   and then the Tandy developer sub-licensed it
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:53.300]   to someone with Atari,
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:55.740]   and then they made the console version.
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:58.460]   But Nintendo licensed it directly from whoever
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.260]   was running the licensing stuff.
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:01.100]   - Wow.
[02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:02.260]   - And so Nintendo won.
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:03.500]   It was this huge court battle,
[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:05.140]   it went on for a couple of years.
[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:07.460]   Atari had to scrap the whole thing.
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:09.100]   Those cartridges, if you can find one,
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:10.900]   there are very few that are out in the wild
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:12.860]   are worth a tremendous amount of money.
[02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:16.140]   And the guy who, I spoke actually with the guy
[02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:17.780]   who runs Tetris Holdings,
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:20.060]   which is the company that does all the licensing,
[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:22.820]   and the different gyrations,
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:26.820]   both because of the Soviet Union at the time,
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:28.980]   and also the fact that it was a burgundy
[02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:31.500]   home computer and console market at the time,
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:32.740]   there should be, and there isn't,
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:34.380]   but there should be a book just on
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:36.860]   all the weird licensing stuff that's happened
[02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:38.500]   with Tetris, it's fascinating.
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:43.140]   But they still, EA owns the game and publishes it.
[02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:45.140]   - And by the way, there's a crap job of it.
[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:47.340]   - They do, they do, but Tetris.com
[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:50.100]   and TetrisFriends.com are the ones that Alexi
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:53.220]   and this other guy still maintain control over.
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:56.060]   And you can actually play the Game Boy version of Tetris,
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:57.820]   complete with the music and in black and white,
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:06:00.940]   and like a little flash thing at TetrisFriends.com,
[02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:01.980]   which is always fun.
[02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:03.100]   - That's awesome.
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:05.300]   And so, Tetris.com, I mean,
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:08.220]   there's a lot of ads and stuff, but you can play it,
[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:10.020]   and that's the key.
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:10.860]   I love it.
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:13.380]   In fact, there's a gazelle ad and an Xfinity ad.
[02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:14.460]   I love it.
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:15.900]   - Because they knew you were there, Leo.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:18.420]   - They knew it was me, they've been following me.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:20.380]   Those were personalized ads.
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:21.780]   - I was gonna say thanks, Google.
[02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:22.620]   - And Zoot Taylor.
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:24.300]   (laughing)
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:27.300]   - What's your highest score do you remember?
[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:28.900]   - Oh, I've scored over a million several times.
[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:30.580]   Me, went over to over 10 million,
[02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:32.180]   'cause you get like a really huge rocket
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:35.060]   if you do that after you get to a certain level.
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:38.780]   But I mean, I've wasted so many hours of my youth
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:40.700]   and not so much youth playing this game.
[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:41.940]   It's not even--
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:44.540]   - I played the Spectrum Holobyte version a lot.
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:47.020]   That was, and it had great music and backgrounds,
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:49.900]   but that was like the definitive PC version, I think.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:50.740]   - Yeah, that was--
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:52.020]   - But I mostly played it on the Game Boy.
[02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:55.660]   And in fact, until they stopped making versions
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:56.580]   of the Game Boy that would accept
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:58.180]   the original 8-bit cartridges,
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:02.140]   I think it was that the Game Boy Advance SP was the last one.
[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:04.740]   I still have that and the original Tetris cartridge,
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:06.820]   some place in my apartment,
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:11.820]   that a good 20-something years after I first got,
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:15.100]   almost 25 years after I got that game for Christmas,
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:16.220]   I still play it sometimes.
[02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:17.140]   - I'm actually glad you're here
[02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:20.220]   'cause maybe you can identify this picture.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:22.820]   Stephen Wozniak and his wife Janet,
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:25.260]   playing Tetris, head to head,
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:27.420]   what are those devices, are those Game Boy colors?
[02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:28.420]   - Those are Game Boy's, no,
[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:31.180]   those are, that's a Game Boy color and yes,
[02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:34.300]   those are two Game Boy colors that came out,
[02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:35.140]   no, not Game Boy colors,
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.740]   they were the original Game Boy,
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:39.620]   but they released some that were in colors.
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:41.580]   So you could get it in green or clear,
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:43.900]   and then that cable is a link cable,
[02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:47.060]   a Game Boy link cable, which wasn't used with many games
[02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:49.300]   until Pokemon, Pokemon made it very popular,
[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:50.620]   but it would plug into the side of the Game Boy,
[02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:54.500]   but those are two full-size Game Boy's with,
[02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.220]   yeah, they might be,
[02:07:56.220 --> 02:08:00.500]   those are two full-size Game Boy's that are see-through.
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:01.900]   They might be the Game Boy colors,
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.300]   I can't tell from the size of the device,
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:06.820]   but I know exactly what that is, yeah.
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:10.580]   - It was, Wozniak's wife Janet, who I'd love dearly,
[02:08:10.580 --> 02:08:11.820]   we're waiting for the bus,
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.900]   this was a couple of years ago,
[02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:14.980]   we were in a cruise in South America,
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:16.740]   and they whipped out their Game Boys
[02:08:16.740 --> 02:08:18.820]   and they played head-to-head Tetris.
[02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:20.980]   - The fact that they go around with two of those
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:23.860]   and the link cable, that's so cool.
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:25.540]   That's so cool, like honestly,
[02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:26.620]   this is why we love you, Woz.
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:30.580]   That's why Woz is like the ultimate nerd,
[02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:32.500]   and we all love him so much.
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:34.380]   We shouldn't listen to any of his predictions about Apple
[02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:38.220]   ever because no, but he's like, he's the every geek.
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:39.660]   He's one of us.
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:41.420]   - And that's why we love Chris.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:43.500]   - He and his wife were both wearing eye watches.
[02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:46.660]   - They're wearing iPod Nano watches, yeah.
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:48.660]   - Yeah, oh yeah, there's probably the TikToks
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:50.500]   or something to say, I guess, yeah.
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.740]   - And then on his left hand, he's got, of course,
[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:55.540]   got his Nixi watch, which has Nixi tubes
[02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:56.820]   that show the time.
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:58.900]   (laughs)
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:02.820]   - Noodle, cuddle, nerd.
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:03.660]   - Nerd geek.
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:07.860]   - It's just, it makes me feel so normal.
[02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:08.940]   (laughs)
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:12.020]   - Well, and can I say, Christina Warren,
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:14.100]   you have earned incredible geek cred
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:16.860]   that you were able to immediately identify
[02:09:16.860 --> 02:09:19.500]   the hardware that you were using,
[02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:20.700]   and we are just so thrilled.
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:21.780]   We love having you on the show.
[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:23.380]   Thank you for being here.
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:24.660]   Thank you for being here.
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:27.580]   Christina writes for Mashable, film girl on Twitter
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:31.420]   @film_girl, and always a pleasure to have you on the show.
[02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:32.260]   Thanks so much for being here.
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:34.220]   I'm so glad the internet works today.
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:35.860]   - Yes, I'm so glad it didn't fail,
[02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:38.900]   and I'm so glad to be on with my Twitter pal,
[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:39.740]   Ed.
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:41.100]   - That's so, you know what?
[02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:42.540]   This was fun.
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:43.900]   We should do this more often.
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:45.300]   This was a lot of fun.
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.420]   Ed Bob, maybe every Sunday, I don't know.
[02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:48.260]   Ed Bob.
[02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:49.420]   (laughs)
[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:50.940]   Ed Bob writes for Zeede Net.
[02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:52.660]   You can find his great columns there.
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:55.260]   Occasionally he'll appear on our Windows Weekly show
[02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:58.100]   or just around here and there.
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:00.460]   And an old friend and a new friend,
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:02.300]   but I just, I think you guys are the greatest.
[02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:04.020]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:04.860]   - Thank you, Leo.
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:06.100]   And thanks Christina.
[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:07.900]   It was fun. - Really fun.
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.540]   She's such a geek.
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:10.380]   (laughs)
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:11.820]   - I am. - Oh my God.
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:14.140]   You're just a font of knowledge.
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:15.620]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon,
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:18.300]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time,
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:20.820]   2200 UTC if you wanna join us live,
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:23.180]   the chat room and your live participation
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:24.620]   always make it a lot more fun for me.
[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:26.460]   So I love it if you can, but if not, don't worry.
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:30.220]   We've got on-demand audio and video available at twit.tv.
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:34.460]   And wherever you get your Netcast iTunes, Xbox, music,
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:37.540]   the podcast apps on your phone or your desktop.
[02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:38.980]   And of course, if you have the Twit apps
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:40.860]   and we have a number, we don't write any of them,
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:42.620]   but our third party developers do a great job
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:45.420]   on iOS, on Android, on Windows Phone.
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:47.460]   That's another great way to get every episode.
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:50.660]   Don't miss an episode each and every week of This Week in Tech.
[02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:52.060]   Thanks to our producer Chad Johnson
[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:55.540]   who put together a fabulous lineup of stories
[02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:57.820]   that we didn't even begin to scratch the surface of.
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:10:59.380]   There's so much more we could talk about.
[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:00.940]   Thank you, Chad.
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:03.180]   But we'll just have to do that another day.
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:04.020]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:05.340]   We'll see you next time.
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:06.180]   Another Twit.
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:07.180]   Isn't it, Ken?
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:08.180]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:10.180]   [applause]
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:12.180]   And a lovely live audience.
