[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.240]   We're all gathered together to talk about technology
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.060]   news with Mr. John C. Devorak.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.140]   Hello.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.060]   Wearing his-- this is good in honor of March Madness,
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.540]   his referee shirt.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.300]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.860]   Keeping the peace between me and Leo.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.860]   Wait a minute.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.660]   Could that be?
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.340]   Yes, it is.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.220]   Becky Worley.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.860]   Hello, Becky.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.700]   Hello.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.660]   What are you up to these days?
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.420]   ABC News is Becky Worley.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.460]   Yeah, but do a little--
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.700]   working on my Twitter account.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.300]   So if you know folks want to follow, be Worley.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.060]   Be Worley.
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.140]   Yes, W-O-R-L-E-Y.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.100]   We should have picked you.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.020]   You know, when Kevin was on a couple of weeks ago,
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.860]   we picked a random Twitter user.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.060]   Who bailed?
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.140]   No, she came back.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.660]   Oh, did she?
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.900]   Oh, big time.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.980]   She's rather enjoying--
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.220]   Somebody clued her in?
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.260]   Said, hey, yeah, you know, this is a-- you could--
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.340]   that's not a bad thing.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.460]   What was the bad thing?
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.100]   So remember that Conan O'Brien had no followers, right?
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.780]   So people will kind of say, Conan,
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.660]   you're not a real Twitter user.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.620]   So he picked at random one person to follow.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.940]   And she's-- what was her name?
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.180]   Tojamfootball--
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.580]   What was it?
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.020]   It was Twitter.com/lovelybutton, I think.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.900]   More just sideboards or whatever.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.820]   Very good.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.340]   You got it.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.380]   I was with you.
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.780]   Her name is Lovely Button.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.020]   And Lovely Button now has 28,344 followers from none,
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.380]   thanks to Conan O'Brien.
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.180]   Well, we said we said we should do the same thing.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.700]   I think so.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.260]   We should show our power, the power of the twit.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.460]   So I said, Kevin, pick somebody at random.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.340]   He did.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.420]   He actually did a search on Twitter for the phrase,
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.460]   I hate technology.
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.220]   And found a woman--
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.820]   Smart move.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.060]   A woman from New Zealand who had-- that was her first tweet.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.780]   She had three followers.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.860]   Her name is Lisa Tickled Pink.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.060]   I'm happy to say that Lisa Tickled Pink currently
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.820]   has 25,343 followers.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.580]   And you know what?
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.740]   She's loving it.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.820]   I thought she hated it.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.860]   Wow, she had a technology before.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.860]   Well, what did she turn off her mouth?
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.860]   Oh, you talked to her.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.340]   I talked to her.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.860]   We did an interview on Radio Whammo in Auckland, Kiwi FM.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.420]   She said, at first I thought I did something wrong,
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.900]   because I had 12,000 emails from Twitter.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.060]   So she didn't understand.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.060]   And somebody explained to her.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.060]   And she said, oh, this is great.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.060]   She's actually really gotten into it.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.020]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.940]   David Spark did this thing about how, if you're in technology,
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.900]   Twitter is a part of your resume.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.180]   How many followers you have is an indication
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.460]   of what your read should--
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.180]   It's key.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.620]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.180]   And it's funny, because I remember when you guys--
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.500]   I was obscenely pregnant when Twitter was really exploding.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.540]   And you guys were talking about it all the time.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.180]   And I just was off the radar completely
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.860]   for the first time after Twitter, because I was having kids
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.100]   and doing that.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.100]   And now it's like--
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.020]   You were like being normal.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.020]   OK, I'm back on TV.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.340]   I'm doing this.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.660]   And OK, Twitter, right.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.420]   Better follow it.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.260]   So what is it at?
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.100]   @bwarly.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.020]   B-W-O-R-L-E-Y.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.060]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.900]   Let's give her a nice big plug, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.100]   Appreciate you.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.780]   So guess why we're talking about this.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.980]   Well--
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.620]   Go ahead, John.
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.780]   Well, I was going to say if people
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.540]   want to look at crackpots doing Twittering,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.460]   you should check out my sons.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.940]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.460]   Twitter/12/2.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.580]   12?
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.100]   You got 12, T-W-E-L-E-E-2, T-W-O.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.540]   OK.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.580]   And why is that his handle 12, too?
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.740]   I have no idea.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.460]   Means something.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.820]   But this is the kind of eastmost part.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.020]   He decided to take this thing to a metal level.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.660]   Place the bookmark in my book.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.300]   Now I can find my place when I return to it later.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.420]   Found the screw.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.660]   It was where I left it.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.660]   Put down a screw.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.900]   Not sure if it is where I left it.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.260]   Oh, I guess you have to read them in order.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.100]   Well, it helped.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.900]   Lost power cannot use electricity.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.940]   Power is back.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.900]   The lights are on again.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.380]   The electric kettle boiled the water, but I waited too long.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.300]   I will have to boil it again.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.940]   This is good.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.940]   This is kind of funny.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.660]   That's funny.
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.060]   He's only got nine followers.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.300]   Let's follow him, everybody.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.460]   Now here's the reason you should follow Lisa Tikkelspink.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.420]   Because I'm going to pick one of her followers at random
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.780]   and give that person an iPad.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.300]   And I'm going to give Lisa Tikkelspink an iPad for a trouble.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.140]   Right.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.900]   So you should follow her.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.900]   Because I want her to be--
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.940]   You're up in the ante here with this kind of gimmick.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.900]   I'm up in the ante.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.340]   This is all radio tricker.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.860]   It is.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.620]   I'm going to give an-- so Lisa, because I felt bad,
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.820]   I said, well, I better give her some.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.380]   So I've ordered two iPads, one for Lisa.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.340]   I'm going to FedEx it to her.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.620]   Because she won't be able to get it in New Zealand.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.380]   So I'm going to FedEx her an American-made iPad.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.140]   Well, actually, Chinese-made design in California iPad.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.580]   And then one of her followers will
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.020]   pick it random on April 3rd and give that person an iPad,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.460]   unless lovely button still is beating her.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.380]   Then none of you win.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.020]   How about that?
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.820]   Can you do that?
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.100]   I like threatening the audience.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.340]   That's a positive thing.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.820]   That's new.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.580]   That's just going to be in it.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.700]   Hey, you know what today is?
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.540]   This is the fourth anniversary of Twitter.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.620]   The very first tweet was posted by--
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.540]   I can't remember his name-- Alex.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.060]   Alex.
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.180]   One of the guys on March 21, 2006.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.860]   Well, that's fantastic.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.820]   God, that was related down here.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.820]   All right, let's move to the news.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.540]   Does it make you feel old?
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.420]   That it's four years old?
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.700]   Well, how old's your kid?
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.620]   Two.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.660]   So you really-- I mean, you missed the boat by two years.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.540]   Yeah, you're way off.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.620]   Well, I was--
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.620]   Well, it was hitting--
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.540]   It was fantastic.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.500]   OK, you got pregnant nine months before that,
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.340]   if my calculations were correct.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.980]   You're good that way.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.980]   And that would mean two years and nine months before.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.180]   Three years ago.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.340]   Yeah.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.140]   I have an excuse, people, OK?
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.180]   She was pregnant.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.020]   Yeah, with twins.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.860]   It seems to be that it would be just the opposite.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.860]   If you were pregnant, you were going
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.740]   to find something to do with your--
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.300]   Anything.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.740]   Yeah, so you'd find some meaningless thing
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.740]   to do like Twittering.
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.780]   Lisa, tickle.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.540]   The only thing you can do to satisfy anything that's,
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.700]   you know, make you feel good is watch
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.900]   bad television when you're pregnant.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.580]   Let me tell you.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.340]   And which particular kind of flavor of bad television?
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.740]   I think it was John and Kate plus eight.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.740]   Oh, God, it's so bad.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.740]   I know.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.740]   I'm so sorry.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.420]   Now she's not dancing with the stars.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.900]   She is.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.500]   Kate Gosling.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.740]   She had her lips done, I think.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.700]   My son just jumped from nine to 156.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.220]   Well, there you go.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.940]   There's the power.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.460]   Well, maybe I'll give him more impetus to post more often.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.500]   Don't confuse things.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.380]   So I'm not giving an iPad to followers of 12/2.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.260]   Just to redirect on my--
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:40.860]   One more thing.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.740]   He has an iPad.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.100]   Lisa tickle pink, does he?
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.900]   Yes.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.220]   He's ruined the family.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.340]   I mean, how do you get an iPad?
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.220]   He bought one.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.300]   You can't buy one.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.340]   You're not out to April 3.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.220]   Oh, no, I'm out to give an I-Mac.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.180]   Never mind.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.100]   I still haven't woken up.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.500]   Lisa tickle pink's last tweet is actually
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.260]   about lovely button.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.500]   Apparently lovely button has a stylist, she says.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.460]   Now they're fighting.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.820]   Where did I go wrong?
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.100]   But people would be champing at the bit to get me in beige.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.780]   She's kind of in the pink.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.980]   So to the news, what is the story about the iPhone and a 4G ad?
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.500]   There's no 4G iPhone.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.700]   But Sprint is announcing they're doing that clear thing.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.540]   And Clear Wire.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.180]   And they-- Sprint is released an ad that features the iPhone.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.180]   Now they don't have the iPhone.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.060]   Clear Wire is Y-Macs.
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.860]   Yeah, 4G.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.660]   That's the 4G that Sprint's going to use.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.460]   It's Y-Macs.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.220]   But is that the official 4G?
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.380]   Or is that just Y-Macs?
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.060]   I mean, there's nothing new about Y-Macs.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:40.980]   No, that's a good point.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.660]   In fact, Y-Macs has turned out to be kind of a flop.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.980]   We were underwhelmed by 4G speed in both Vegas and Austin.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.300]   You were using Y-Macs?
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.900]   We tried.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.820]   Yeah, well, they call it Sprint 4G Clear Wire.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.300]   Clear Wire.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.820]   Y-Macs.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.100]   They're using up in Portland.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.300]   Same Y-Macs.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:55.820]   There's only one.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.540]   Yeah, Clear Wire.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.740]   Clear Wire.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.940]   And it sucks.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.620]   Well, in Portland, I'll tell me, oh, it's fantastic.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.020]   I wasn't--
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.740]   It was not much faster than our other 3G connections.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.540]   Maybe a lot of people were using it.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.220]   So here's the deal.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:15.100]   The overdrive is a mobile router that uses Sprint's 3G, 4G,
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.260]   and turns it into Wi-Fi.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.780]   So you can use it with an iPhone via Wi-Fi.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.180]   So it's like a Wi-Fi card.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.980]   It's like a Wi-Fi.
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.820]   Can you tether?
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.260]   Are you kidding?
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.100]   Maybe you can Wi-Fi.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.060]   I guess that's a no.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.940]   You can't tether because to tether you would need--
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.580]   the phone would need to be doing it.
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.220]   The Wi-Fi is the tether.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:36.940]   The Wi-Fi is like--
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.740]   The device itself.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.340]   No, I'm just thinking about the 4G.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.340]   I got an iPhone.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.100]   It's a 3G-T's 3G speeds.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.340]   So I'm going to use the overdrive 4G mobile hotspot
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.300]   to make it up to 10 times faster.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.260]   It's just like a Wi-Fi.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.460]   Wow, that's happening.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.060]   I'm going to enjoy this tasty snack.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:55.560]   OK.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.460]   Is that your son?
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.180]   That looks like a--
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.460]   was eating a turd.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.860]   Well, usually, yes.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.500]   That was an apple.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.940]   What can you do with 4G?
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.620]   You eat an apple.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.460]   Whatever you do.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.460]   Do you not eat a lot of them faster than 3M?
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.460]   With 4G from the spread.
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.940]   No, they're eating the apple.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.420]   Get it?
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:11.940]   The apple.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.100]   Oh, it's a knowledge.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.820]   Oh, it's a pun.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.060]   They're eating the apple brand.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.100]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.380]   God, we're slow.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.540]   Look at the U.S.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.540]   So slow.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.020]   I went turdical on you.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.940]   People humor.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.180]   Yeah, he went scatological.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.340]   I went biblical.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.660]   You got it.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.740]   They're eating the apple's lunch.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.140]   Yeah, well, then apple's going to go after them.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.260]   I don't think they can.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.180]   What do you think about these lawsuits, the apple?
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.660]   I never did ask you, John, the HTC lawsuits.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.580]   Yeah, what about them?
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.060]   What do you think?
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.540]   Is that apple being--
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.340]   Apple.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.180]   It's apple being apple.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:43.860]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.740]   Ooh, we can sue somebody.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.260]   Let's do it.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.900]   That apple be apple, man.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.660]   Well, aggressive and predatory may not scare the big boys,
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.860]   but it scares enough of the small guys away.
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.620]   And HTC is not as small as they look.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.660]   No.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.500]   Seems to me that it's almost an admission
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.260]   that they're not making it in the marketplace
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.180]   when they have to sue people.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.780]   It's like, well, if they--
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.980]   But that's been their tradition, making it or not making it.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.900]   They don't care.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.900]   They're litigious.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.060]   So Palm had a very bad Friday.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.220]   Palm was in trouble.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.660]   You think Palm's dead?
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.820]   Well, I predicted Palm was dead when that phone came out.
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.660]   The pre?
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.660]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.180]   So I call it pre-bankruptcy.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:30.700]   So Palm really put all its eggs in the pre-basket.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.220]   They killed everything else that they were doing.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.860]   They said, we're going to develop a new OS.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.140]   They hired away much of the Apple iPhone team,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.940]   including John Rubenstein, who's now running the company,
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.020]   and designed what they thought would be a Palm killer--
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.140]   I mean, iPhone killer, the Palm pre, running a new operating
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.420]   system, WebOS.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.060]   And really, by killing everything else,
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.460]   they said, we're going to make it on this,
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.260]   and we're not going to make it.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.340]   Well, I think the jury's in.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.980]   And it's not been good for Palm.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.020]   I don't know what they're going to do.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.220]   They had a ton of buzz.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.220]   They had to head start.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.500]   Not last CES.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.260]   Two CES is now.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.500]   Yeah, when they announced the pre,
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.700]   everybody was excited about that.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.660]   That was the pre-CES they showed the pre-at, right?
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.180]   It looked gorgeous.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:12.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.020]   Stock flew at that point, by the way.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.940]   It was big boom.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.100]   It had a couple of nice rides.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.060]   Friday, it was down 28% to something like $4 or $5.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.700]   I mean, it was bad.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.060]   Yeah, but right after the announcement
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.620]   and during that little period that you would have invested
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.180]   in Palm, you would have made up fortune.
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.900]   I think it went 5X or something like that.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.420]   Now it would have been a good short.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.220]   I'm sad because I really love Palm.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.820]   And I was an early Palm pilot user.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.460]   Yeah, so was I.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.540]   And a trio for everyone.
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:38.980]   So was I.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.180]   I had one of those, too.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.980]   Trio was great.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.700]   They dropped the ball somewhere along the line.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.700]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.300]   Where did they go?
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.740]   What could they have done differently?
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.540]   Well, they could have-- I think management,
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.060]   they kept swapping management around
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.300]   to finally getting people that had never had a vision.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.100]   Why didn't they get in bed with Apple?
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.860]   I feel like they did what everything they could.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.100]   I think the pre was a really nice phone.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.620]   I don't think there was anything wrong with the pre.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.780]   Maybe if they made one mistake, it
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.900]   was making it sprint instead of Verizon.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.340]   I don't think that was it.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.780]   I don't think the pre was exciting enough.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.060]   It wasn't different enough.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.140]   The keyboard was kind of funky.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.380]   It wasn't different enough.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.540]   You have to be so much better to beat the iPhone.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.540]   There were three things that were different.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.860]   One, the keyboard, tactile.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.620]   Good.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.980]   Two, wireless charging.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.340]   It had that hockey puck that you could put the pre down on.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.340]   And ducts and charging.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.500]   You make--
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.900]   Third thing, it had a mirror on the back of it.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.300]   So you could put your lipstick on with it.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.260]   That rock.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.260]   You noticed that.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.260]   I did a figure.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.060]   There was a mirror?
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.820]   Yeah, well, it was shiny.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.220]   When you slid up the keyboard, there
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.300]   was a very shiny metal.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.140]   And once then, also multiple apps at the same time.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.540]   It had multitasking.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.180]   It had multitasking, absolutely.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:52.980]   So here's the sad news.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.860]   I'm trying to get the results.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.620]   They actually did worse than the-- this is always bad.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.820]   Did worse than the analyst's most negative prediction.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.460]   Yeah, you might as well shoot yourself if that happens.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.980]   Shares of Palm fell the most in more than two years in NASDAQ
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.580]   trading after it forecast sales this quarter that were less
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.580]   than half analysts estimate.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.940]   Half revenue in the period ending may
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.340]   be less than $150 million.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.860]   This fall falling short of the $300 million average estimate
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.260]   from analysts.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.300]   It's 11th consecutive quarterly loss.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.940]   Shares 29% down to $4 on $4.
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.900]   Is this an incorrect hypothesis that, OK, there's the iPhone.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.020]   There are random phones that are running various sort of--
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.420]   Well, there's black-- look, there's blackberry.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.420]   There's iPhone.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.460]   There's Android, which is huge.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.740]   Microsoft comes back into the game with Windows 7 phone,
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.860]   which they've just announced, but won't be about the end of the year.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.380]   So my point is it's either Windows 7 phone or the Google phone
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.700]   or the Android phones that pushed Palm to the periphery.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.140]   And one of those was unexpected.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.420]   And I think that was probably Google, if you look at the long way--
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.220]   No, I don't think so.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.340]   I think the iPhone-- it's been around for a while now,
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.780]   but I think that really caught everybody flat footed.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.860]   Stronger than expected.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:09.420]   Well, fair enough.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.300]   That's because it was a new paradigm.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.100]   But I'm talking about their comeback, which happened well
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.580]   after the iPhone's--
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.940]   Yeah, I mean, that's why I was predicting that I was actually
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.260]   stunned by the stock going up as much as it did.
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.780]   But that's why I was using that joke pre-bankruptcy
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.380]   and all this other stuff.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.580]   And I was doing it on this show way before it came out.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.580]   You were right.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.020]   And I kept staying with that theory
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.420]   because I didn't see how they could possibly come back
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.860]   from the situation as it now exists, which is we have a new paradigm
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.020]   for a phone, which is a phone with no keyboard that you--
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.860]   like the Google Nexus, you talk into it
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.540]   and tell it what you want to type.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.420]   Nobody wants a keyboard, I think.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.340]   I think that's true.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.860]   I think it's an old school to have a keyboard on one of these things.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.140]   I still use my little Nokia with the keyboard because--
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.380]   The E71, you still like that.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:52.740]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.820]   Because the keyboard's nice.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.380]   The phone is--
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.100]   But I look at the phones that I'm using are
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.940]   Droid, Nexus One, and iPhone.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.220]   Droid has a keyboard, but I never slide it out.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.020]   Yeah, I would say Google, Nexus One--
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.900]   I love the dictation.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.300]   It's great.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.820]   Dictation thing is astonishing.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.140]   Well, there are a couple subgroups
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.380]   that I think make this interesting.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.900]   So for my dad, I was just looking for a phone for him.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.500]   And he desperately needs a full-size tactile numeric keyboard.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.180]   He's older.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:16.700]   Right.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.300]   Then you've got hardcore textures
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.900]   who love the sidekick, Teens.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.620]   They love that flip out--
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.980]   Microsoft on Zen now.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.660]   And then one of the things I think as we--
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.460]   if I can transition this slightly-- is the smartphone world
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.500]   is actually declining.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.340]   It's not growing as fast as it used to be.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.300]   That's a major byproduct of the economy.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:37.900]   What are they buying?
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.780]   Oh, they're just not buying.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.500]   Well, a huge part of it is that all smartphones must
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.220]   mandatory be sold with a data plan.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.700]   Right.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.300]   So it costs more yearly and monthly.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.020]   And those data plans are substantial.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.300]   If you're trying to cut back, it's a really--
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.020]   It's a no-brainer.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.700]   It's another 30 bucks a month.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.700]   That's 400 bucks a year.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.660]   Smartphone goes away because you can't even
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.380]   buy the smartphone if you can't afford the data plan.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.860]   Well, if you can get a smartphone unlocked
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.180]   when you don't need a data plan, you
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.980]   can just pop in at SIM card and use Wi-Fi for the data.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.100]   But again, then we're talking about a $500 phone.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.780]   Only a third of US adults own smartphones right now.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.380]   Is that true, really?
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.420]   Only a third.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.620]   That's actually high.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.860]   I think that's a big number.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.500]   I think it used to be next to nothing.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.860]   A third of adults.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.300]   Fine, but I'm just saying it's next to nothing now.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.740]   I mean, it was next to nothing.
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.540]   And now it's a third.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.260]   That's, I think, a huge growth rate.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.780]   I think the smartphone's going to take over.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.620]   And I agree with all the numbers that you're throwing out there.
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.940]   But I think that the trend is clear.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.380]   And that is everybody's going to have
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.100]   one of these keyboardless smartphones
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.940]   that you flip around with your thumb.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.020]   And I just don't see anything competing with that.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.380]   Is the iPad going to change any of this?
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.260]   No, iPad's a joke.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:51.660]   Really?
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.260]   You think so?
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.740]   Well, we bet on this already.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.260]   I know, and I'm going to win that bet.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:55.740]   You might.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.260]   What did I bet?
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.860]   I bet it would solve 4 million copies.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.460]   5.
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.700]   5 in the first year.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.100]   12 months.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.660]   12 months.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.340]   Easy.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:02.780]   No.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.300]   Easy.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:03.740]   Because of the crazy.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.300]   5 million in the first year seems big.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.540]   Apple's building 7.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.180]   OK, wait.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.020]   You're building 7 million?
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.060]   That's the story.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.820]   OK.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.100]   I want to finish one thing on phones.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:11.660]   And I want to talk.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.580]   I can be sick.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.540]   We got more on the phones.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.860]   Because if the Palm CEO says, we could have been somebody.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.100]   I could have been a contender.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.460]   Well, Charlie, why didn't you take care of me?
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.180]   Who was the Charlie who didn't take care of me?
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.860]   Charlie, if we could have launched-- this is John Rubenstein.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.980]   If we could have launched at Verizon prior to the droid,
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.060]   I think we could have gotten the attention the droid got.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.620]   And since I believe we have a better product,
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.100]   I think we could have done even better.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.420]   I think they're missing the point.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.260]   I think it's too late.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.300]   They're missing the point, too.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.020]   The droid got a lot of attention because it's open source
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.940]   and it runs Linux.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.580]   And it's this and it does that.
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.780]   And I mean, I think they're missing the point.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.260]   They're just--
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.980]   You know, the Google phone, the Android now,
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.620]   is available from Google to run on AT&T.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.340]   As well as T-Mobile, they just did that.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.940]   They've announced Sprint and Verizon in the next month or so.
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.060]   So they're going to be on every platform, it's almost.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.260]   And I love this Nexus 1.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.940]   I actually think it's a great phone.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.620]   I like it, too.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.540]   They just have to so slippery.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.020]   You keep saying you drop it.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.580]   You look very--
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.620]   I like what they did.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.100]   Look at they did.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.860]   They put a little Google Buzz widget on there now.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.780]   I like Google Buzz, but you know, I'm the only one.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.060]   I'm actually the only one who uses it.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:15.460]   Host to Buzz.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.900]   That's because you have no filter for privacy.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.900]   I can remember when you first started at Pumper Help,
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.700]   you would show pictures of your infant children on the air.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.540]   What's wrong with that?
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.580]   It freaked me out.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.540]   But what's wrong with that?
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.300]   I was just--
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:27.780]   Why?
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.100]   What is some bad guy going to say, oh, there's a baby?
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.780]   I'm going to go find out who that guy is and take his baby.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.780]   He's the bad policy.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.420]   He's just creeped me out back in '97, '98.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.140]   It was just a--
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.260]   I was just ahead of my time.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:39.620]   I got through.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.700]   Now, when I weigh myself, it goes out on the internet.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.220]   Did you get my pitch?
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.660]   What's your pitch?
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.220]   You're going to-- by the way, Wayne, you're so--
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.060]   By the way, I weigh 217.5 pounds.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.660]   And I, by the way, you're going to overload the network.
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.340]   So Calicana is also--
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.580]   He weighs himself in public.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:55.940]   Yep.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.580]   And my three was--
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.180]   What is the point of this?
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.300]   Well, it keeps you honest.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.100]   Well, it keeps you honest.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:00.860]   Keep you honest.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.100]   Keep you honest.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.100]   Look at the thing.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.100]   What do you like to yourself?
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.580]   Well, it says 205.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.740]   That says 190.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.260]   You can keeps you honest.
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.580]   Because shame is a powerful motivator.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.620]   Shame, baby.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.100]   Unless you weigh 300 pounds, you're
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.700]   not going to be shamed into anything.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.420]   I'm getting close.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:15.900]   I'm shamed.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.420]   I'm shamed.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.180]   I'm close.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.620]   That you and Calicana--
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.180]   I'm in, if you want, and any other chequi people set a goal--
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.780]   --what your weight needs to be by August.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.580]   And then we do "Twit the Pool Party."
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.940]   We should-- oh.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.180]   And we put all kinds of metrics around.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.220]   I'll do that.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.220]   And Jason will do that.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.900]   So Jason--
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.940]   And we show up in our suits.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.780]   We have to have some--
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.940]   Are you going to do it too?
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.420]   Well, I think we need to get, like,
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.180]   Veronica or somebody.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.500]   People will come to see you in a bathing suit.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.860]   Yeah, get Veronica.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.940]   I'll go to that event.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.700]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.340]   So anyways, I'll go work on the bathing suit.
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.300]   I don't know why she hasn't picked up her Star Trek outfit
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.500]   that we hadn't done for her.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.620]   Because you humiliated her.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.060]   That's why.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.100]   So I'm doing how--
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.020]   So let's look at--
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.620]   this is actually part of the show, I think.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.980]   What are you looking at my texts?
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.780]   No.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.700]   No, I should be.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.140]   And the good idea-- she's one of my thinking.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.500]   So no, I'm looking at the apps.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.020]   Yes.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.180]   Now I'm going to go over a few of them.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.620]   And so you can recommend or not--
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.940]   I could tell you whether they're good or not.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.660]   You got-- well, the Yelp, YouTube,
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.820]   is that you're not going to do any of those--
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.460]   All the standard ones.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.340]   W-P to go.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.020]   I don't know what word--
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.660]   That's word press.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.160]   OK.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.620]   Who needs it?
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:18.980]   Where?
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.820]   What's where?
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.100]   Where you press a button.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:21.900]   It knows where you are.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.260]   And it tells you what's around you.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.460]   It's-- there's a number of location, like--
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.020]   Which is where--
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:26.940]   --abrogations is that the one I should get.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.820]   Where's pretty good?
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.460]   Alokwa is another one that's pretty good.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.140]   The truth is with Google's own applications.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.940]   And Bing is pretty good that way.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.820]   You're kind of set.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.700]   You don't really need these--
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.740]   OK, you stream, you stream, blend.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.180]   That's you stream both I can watch and broadcast
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.540]   from that phone.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.340]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.780]   It was the Ustream Biggest Day Ever was Tsunami Day.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.180]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:46.780]   You know why?
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.860]   Biggest Day Ever for a non-corporate event.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.260]   Some watching CNN.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.740]   I'm watching all the TV stations.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.420]   What are they playing?
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.620]   Ustream.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.580]   Yeah, I saw that too.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.780]   I thought that was ridiculous.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.420]   Michael Jackson was the biggest corporate day
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.180]   they've ever had.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.900]   And by a factor of 7%, the tsunami was as big.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.380]   But it was all independent.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.300]   You know who owns them now, effectively?
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.300]   Sun-son.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.100]   Masayoshi-son.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.620]   Oh, wait.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.940]   Major investor in Ustream.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.500]   In Ustream?
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.820]   Yeah, I just put like 70 million at Ustream.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.260]   Interesting.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.860]   What's Toon-Wiki?
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.700]   Toon-Wiki you like.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.100]   It's a-- so there's a site called Toon-Wiki that
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.500]   is a wiki where people put lyrics up.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   Toon-Wiki is an alternative media player.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.540]   It's available on the iPhone 2 that plays your music
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.180]   but posts the lyrics in sync to the music
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.900]   as you're watching it.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:28.900]   Really?
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.400]   Really?
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:29.900]   It is.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:30.420]   That's nice.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.220]   Isn't that sweet?
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.220]   Yeah, that's a stage.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:32.860]   And then also, it has a button there.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.940]   You can find the videos.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.180]   Gitch Henderson comes to mind.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.380]   Wow, you guys are dating so many.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.860]   I think Mitch Miller is who you think of.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.100]   Oh, I think I don't care.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.740]   I've got a lovely bunch of cook--
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.300]   A stream for--
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.980]   Stream Furious is a radio internet radio program.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.900]   No, is it-- oops.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.380]   [SCREAM]
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.980]   Dogg on it.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.020]   10 to 20% of people who have smartphones
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.820]   have planned to lose their data plans in the next year.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.220]   10 to 20% because it's too expensive.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.820]   You know she's reoccupied with this topic later.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:01.980]   Well, I think she's got a good point.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.940]   I mean, she says that there's a vulnerability
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.900]   in the smartphone market.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.300]   She hates smartphones and she's now
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   taking it out on the show.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.580]   No, I just like to take the technorati
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.860]   and take them to task for the average folks who are sort of--
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.980]   Trying to provide useful information to the listeners
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.500]   for reviewing these apps.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.620]   Budget, conscious.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.300]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.900]   Becky goes on and on and on and on.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.820]   There's one topic she's reoccupied.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.020]   So I got another site that I do called Blippi.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.140]   Blippi does.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.500]   It tells everybody what I bought.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.180]   Like from all the credit cards and everything.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.980]   Oh, that's serious on the internet.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.060]   Wow, okay, that is hard.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.780]   Why?
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.060]   It's actually-- it's strangely compelling.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.940]   Because you already had three classes.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.220]   You can watch what Jason Calicanis has bought.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:42.780]   That could be a lot.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.460]   You can watch what a lot of other people have bought.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.700]   And then you see what they buy.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.340]   That's how I found out about the Wi-Fi scale.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.660]   Philip Kaplan-Pudd bought the Wi-Fi scale.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.780]   And I thought, oh, that's cool.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.820]   So I bought it.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.420]   Apparently, like seven or eight people from blippi.com
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.140]   have bought Wi-Fi scales because of that.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.260]   So it's got a business model of some sort.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.900]   And I think I move into Alaska.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.540]   That's for me, that's way over--
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.620]   Too much?
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.100]   What would be-- okay, you're a woman.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.100]   I think there's a very big gulf between what men and women
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.100]   are willing to share online.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.620]   Yeah, you said this last week about--
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.420]   Do you not think?
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.220]   --location-based stuff.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.620]   Gina Trapani was saying that.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.580]   On Twig, that's a big difference.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.460]   That's why I like that.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.220]   Rob your house.com or whatever the hell.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.220]   Oh, yeah, but nobody's going to rob my house.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.140]   Please rob me.com.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.020]   That was going to rob me.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.620]   That's because you've always got--
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.260]   Oh, that reminds me.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.660]   I haven't checked in here yet.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.740]   Oh, you've got to check in.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.900]   Check in on the house.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.140]   Yeah, that was the weirdest thing at South by Southwest.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.380]   Is that you go anywhere.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.740]   The first thing you do when you step in the door,
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.220]   everybody's got their head hunched over.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.980]   Their smartphone checking in on Gowala and Four Square.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.260]   You don't think that's pathetic?
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.860]   Yeah, it's actually-- I actually do think it's pathetic.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.660]   But I still do it.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.340]   But you know what?
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.420]   I know that you go to the gym a lot.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.060]   You can tell.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:54.900]   You're following me.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.700]   You're my friend.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.540]   You know what?
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.540]   I'm going to set one of these accounts up and just bull--
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.660]   My way to the whole day.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.500]   That's like your son.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:00.900]   I meant the--
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.580]   12, too.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.100]   Oh, look.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.660]   Eric Longstaff just checked in at the Kmart.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.420]   See, now I know.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.780]   I don't even know who Eric Longstaff is, but apparently I--
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.220]   Yeah, but you know where it really is.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.220]   Mom, I'm at church again.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.940]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.420]   Just checked in, Ma.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.540]   St. Vincent de Paul.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.060]   There it is.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.940]   It's right down here.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.580]   So that's the church over here.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.060]   Oh, is it?
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:20.380]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:20.940]   That's the same--
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.140]   Let's go get him and beat him up.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.380]   No, that's the boy that you send all your--
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.020]   Let's track him down.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.020]   This is the perfect half for stall I've heard.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.020]   You know, from now on--
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.380]   because the Twit Cottage is right next door
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.140]   to St. Vincent de Paul.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:29.660]   So right now--
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.780]   Is it really parish as opposed to the place
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.820]   where you send your giveaways?
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.580]   You know that's what St.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.420]   It's St. Vincent's church.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   There's no de Paul.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.100]   I added the de Paul.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:36.460]   OK.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.540]   Just being clear--
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.100]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:38.740]   There's not de Paul.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.260]   --in the room.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:39.500]   No, no.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.980]   But see, from now on, instead of being the mayor of Twit Cottage,
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.260]   I'm going to check in at the church.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:53.500]   Because the geolocation isn't so accurate that it really knows
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.260]   where I am.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.860]   So I'm just going to say I'm in church every day.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.260]   You're totally getting the name.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:57.980]   What do you get?
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.020]   I get something from the Pope probably.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.020]   You get free wine.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.260]   Get something from the Pope?
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:01.780]   Every day.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.060]   I have a joke and they're not going to use it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.460]   Thank you very much.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.260]   Thank you very much, John.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.860]   You just saved me a lawsuit with a Vatican.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.660]   Vatican's got other problems.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.500]   They're locked.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:14.820]   What's the pattern?
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.940]   Were you trying to see my texts?
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.740]   No, I'm going--
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.860]   No, I'm going to go back over the steps.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.020]   He was trying to see my texts.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.340]   No, I wasn't trying to see your texts.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.380]   I don't care what they said.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.180]   Give me the phone.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.860]   I'll unlock it for you.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.540]   Sometimes you can look at this and kind of figure it out.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.860]   You know how you could tell from the smudges?
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.140]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.340]   You could see where the finger smudges are.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.300]   You can unlock it.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:28.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.380]   Very smart.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.900]   Prepaid phones, growing by 20% this year.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.340]   That's because of all the drug dealers.
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:34.980]   No.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.620]   They're buying burners.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.780]   He's a burner guy.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.420]   No way.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:37.980]   Totally.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.140]   No, boost and virgin and AT&T all have these plans.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.180]   Now all the major carriers have the prepaid plans.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.460]   And it's the concept of not--
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.700]   But those are feature phones, right?
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.580]   They're not smartphones when you're buying one of those.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.540]   I think, predominantly, they're just texting
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.540]   and unlimited texting and calls.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.420]   But for people who are trying to convince--
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.260]   Did you unlock it?
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.380]   You did not unlock my phone.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.540]   Watch.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.660]   That's not it.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.260]   I'll show you.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.620]   I got it.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.140]   Tell me it's not this straight up in the middle.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.180]   No, that's not it.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.260]   Go ahead and do it.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.860]   See what it feel unlocks.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.020]   He's looking at the smudges.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.620]   He's trying to decode the smudges.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.140]   That's not it.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.340]   He's still in his thinking.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:14.860]   It's a cold school.
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.100]   This is one thing about the next one.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.020]   I'm not fond of it.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.540]   It's kind of-- oh, because you tried so many times,
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.940]   it locked you out good.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.660]   I mean, good.
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.140]   Good.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.460]   We're trying to review apps here.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.700]   The last time he was in here, he
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.660]   tried to log into my Mint application
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.700]   to see how much I was worth.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.340]   What my net worth was.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.700]   I published that on the internet job.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.900]   I don't know how to use Mint.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.940]   So that's probably not a true story.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.220]   It is a true story.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.380]   I'm seeing-- I go in here.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.940]   And Mint-- and it's like 20 times somebody's tried to log
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.900]   in the Mint.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.180]   Believe me, that wasn't me.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.300]   Sure, sure, sure.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.500]   Here we go.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.100]   Mint is another great application that's
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.620]   the not on the iPhone.
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.460]   So the people who are in charge of these things--
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.060]   and I don't know who that would be.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:55.980]   And what are these things?
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.540]   These things would be the record industry, the movie
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.380]   industry, copyright holders have
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.020]   decided that the word piracy is too sexy.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.860]   Ahoy, Macy.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.540]   They were the ones who created the term in the first place.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.380]   But now they realize that, unfortunately--
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.420]   They created a monster.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.660]   Yeah, Johnny Depp.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.180]   I was to the Caribbean.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.380]   So they're thinking of calling them vampires.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.580]   What?
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.020]   I missed the story.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.900]   That's a bad one.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.900]   No, it's not true.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.060]   He's playing on a line.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.300]   That would be funny, though, if they did.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.300]   You know, it didn't surprise me.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.300]   They're blood sucking.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.540]   I can just see them saying, oh, no, piracy is too sexy.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.700]   Let's see, what can we call them?
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.660]   Bring back Hillary Rosen.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.420]   She's good at this.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.420]   Yeah, they're blood sucking vampires.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.860]   That's not sexy, is it?
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.500]   No.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.980]   No.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.060]   Yeah, what would be the--
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.780]   They want to call them thieves.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.900]   No, but even that.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:52.500]   I mean, if we're really talking about not glorifying parasites--
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.820]   I got a good one.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.340]   I mean, that's not my word.
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.180]   I'm not saying that.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.900]   So if we should change the word privacy,
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.660]   she said blah, blah, blah, translation.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.740]   We should choose them to do sex.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.740]   She's how about fat bastards?
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.380]   That's a good line.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.420]   Have you had fat bastards?
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.700]   All you guys is fat bastards stealing our stuff.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.980]   Get me belly, you little musical thief.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.420]   Oh, you just got Scottish on us.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.900]   I did.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.740]   It's best he can.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.540]   Oh, no, wait.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.820]   As noted-- I love this.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.060]   This is from the article in Ars Technica.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.820]   As noted, copyright scholar William Patrick argued
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.540]   in his most recent book, quote, "To say that X is a pirate
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.980]   is a metaphoric heuristic intended to persuade a policy
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.060]   maker that the in-depth analysis could be skipped
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.220]   and the desired result immediately obtained.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.980]   Claims of piracy are rhetorical nonsense."
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.580]   The pedagogy on that is phenomenal.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.340]   You studied that.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.740]   You got to like a doctorate in that.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.380]   Don't you?
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.420]   I have a strange postgraduate degree.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.660]   What is your degree?
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.540]   It's in a combination of education and computer science.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.740]   It was a program that ran into those programs.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.580]   It was called Learning, Design, and Technology.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.860]   How to teach people through technology.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.660]   And I modified it.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.980]   How to teach technology to people.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.980]   So you have a masters?
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.500]   Yes.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.700]   So should I call you master or mistress?
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.940]   Let me get my letters out.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.940]   Hold on.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.820]   Yes, you should.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.660]   I should call you master.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.860]   That's right.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.500]   I think that this is marketing.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   What could you call piracy?
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.300]   Well, they want to call it thievery,
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.740]   but it's not technically thievery.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.580]   So why was it a--
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.780]   Then what is it, Leo?
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.140]   Copyright violation.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:37.980]   But that doesn't--
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.900]   Why don't they call them copyright violators?
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.500]   Because that doesn't sound bad.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.500]   They're violators.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.500]   They're violators.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.340]   Oh, violators.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.700]   They can call them child masters.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.700]   That is one that has a definite negative connotation.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.540]   But you know, the perception is not--
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.220]   they're right.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.060]   I was talking to someone the other day about another person
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.380]   that we know.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.380]   And he goes, oh, that guy's so great.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.300]   He always down.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.100]   He's such a geek.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.100]   He downloads all the latest movies for us
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.380]   and shares it with everybody.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.420]   He's so generous.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.820]   He's a copyright sharer.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.140]   He is.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.300]   That's the perception.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:07.740]   Right.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.980]   Is that you're a copyright.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.420]   You're a sharer.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.940]   You're a Robin Hood.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.780]   But no, I don't even think they cross their mind whatsoever.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.500]   That there was anything illegal.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.060]   If it's on the internet, it must be OK.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.900]   No, it's actually--
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.860]   There's a sociological problem, because that is absolutely true.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.220]   Most-- you know, there's a lot of people
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.940]   that don't think twice about any of this stuff.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.500]   How about we're getting a suggestion
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.500]   from Titus in the chatroom, Carpet Bagger's?
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.900]   Carpet Bagger.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.060]   Bagger is always a good--
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.060]   Carpet Bagger.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.500]   No.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.700]   Data molesters.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.860]   Columns.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.900]   Data molesters.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.620]   That's good.
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.060]   That actually had to work.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.020]   Hoppy thieves.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.060]   Or what about terrorists?
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:47.460]   What about--
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.300]   Let's go all the way.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.820]   They're some sort of things like it inflates your price.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.740]   So it hits you in your pocketbook.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.060]   Like--
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.220]   Oh, they're stealing from me.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:54.580]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.980]   That's believable.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.820]   If everybody was--
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.420]   Yeah, that'll work.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.900]   And your movie tickets would cost less.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.740]   Yeah, right.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.260]   Sure.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.260]   Sure they would.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.100]   I'm just saying this is what--
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:04.620]   That's not--
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.460]   And that piracy people are saying.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.180]   I'm going to convince anybody.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:06.580]   I don't think.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.180]   Yeah, I-- apparently they're not
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.860]   going to be able to come up with another word.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.940]   Yeah, they're screwed.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.900]   We'll be back in a moment.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.620]   We're talking with Becky Worley of ABC News.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.660]   Good morning, America.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.580]   Mother of five.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.780]   How many kids twins?
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.780]   Two.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.340]   Just two.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.540]   And Twitter at B-Worley.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.460]   I had it spelled wrong.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.700]   I had it B-Worlette.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.940]   Oh.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.060]   So if somebody named B-Worlette suddenly
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:34.860]   gets a lot of followers, give them back.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.980]   Also with us, John C. Devoractwork.org/blog
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.300]   and channel Devoract, a place to get all of John's many.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.020]   They said you sounded drunk this morning on No Adjourno.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.300]   They say that every week.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.100]   I just get up.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.380]   You know, I'm up out of bed all over.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:47.980]   You know, it's funny.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.300]   I'm going to be drunk in the morning.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.100]   I think I'd have-- you know, well, maybe it'd be funny.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.900]   Packet beggars.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.900]   Packet beggars.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:55.780]   They have packet.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.100]   So you were listening to the show this morning?
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.100]   Is that what you're telling us?
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.300]   I listen all the time.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.220]   I love Noah Jenna.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.140]   That's where I get him my conspiracy theories.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.260]   You just hate the show.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.500]   That's what we figure.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.740]   I hate it with a passion.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.100]   It is looking for some.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.700]   I hate it so much.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.540]   Bandwidth hog?
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.060]   You just look at it.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.180]   Bandwidth hog.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.180]   No, it's been used.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.260]   Now you look really tiny.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.500]   I put the microphone up in your face,
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.620]   and you're looking so small.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.260]   And see what I-- now, watch just look over there.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.380]   See, I put Devoract on.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.220]   He looks massive.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.020]   Oh, I'm huge.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.060]   Huge, huge.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.020]   And then I put you on.
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.340]   You look like a little tiny person.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.820]   I got to zoom in or something.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.260]   It's all right.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:26.940]   I'll take Chinese.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.580]   Trust me.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.180]   The tiny Becky Warley.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.140]   We had actually a pretty good no agenda today.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.140]   What were you talking about?
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.300]   I don't remember.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.340]   That is a marketing guy right there.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.260]   It was something.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.060]   You know, you should tune in and find out.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:41.620]   Prior to your coming back--
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.100]   This portion of the show brought to you by--
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:44.620]   thank you, Becky.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.620]   You're so good.
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.300]   What do they do at ABC if it's time for a commercial?
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.780]   They go to black.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.300]   Whether you're talking or not.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.780]   They do.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.380]   They probably do, don't they?
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.260]   Because you're on a live show when you do GMA, there's no like--
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.460]   And the most important--
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.300]   And we're out.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.020]   And we're clear.
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.380]   No, I was demoing the Google Voice Search.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.820]   And I searched Stephanopoulos using Google Voice Search.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.060]   And we were up on a hard break.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.460]   And I said, and look at the result.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.420]   And I turned the camera, the phone to the camera.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.740]   Downly fabric softener.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.100]   I saw the camera for maybe three frames.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.620]   And then they went to black.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.660]   Well, then Jimmy Kimmel grabbed it.
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.460]   And no, Kimmel grabbed it.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.500]   And he had me turning the phone to camera
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.460]   to show the results of the George Stephanopoulos
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.260]   search using Google Voice Search.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.660]   And they showed a picture in the phone of Snuffle Uphlegus.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.940]   I remember that.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.900]   That was very funny.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.260]   You were famous.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.500]   George Snuffle Uphlegus.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.460]   I was mortified.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:40.980]   What do you think?
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.580]   Do you think a writer was watching and said, hey, that
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:44.420]   there's a joke?
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:44.900]   There's material.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.820]   There's material.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.300]   That's right.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.980]   Well, the people on CBS had an easy day.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.100]   They had Harry Smith.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.500]   Gee, that's real tough to test a Google search on that.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.580]   I think George Stephanopoulos is good.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.700]   George Stephanopoulos is actually probably--
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.660]   I get-- we'll try that.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.660]   You get--
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.700]   You're giving it to me.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.100]   Let's try it.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.820]   You rebooted my machine.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.260]   What the hell you doing?
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.100]   We'll do it.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.180]   You're a son of a hacker.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.220]   He rebooted.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.100]   He's trying to get into my system.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.020]   So I'm wiping off all the fingerprints.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.700]   Carbonite.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.500]   If you've got a bad guy like John C. Devore,
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.580]   I'm trying to get it to your data.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.460]   You need to back it up.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.020]   Backup is so important.
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:22.140]   And that's why I recommend carbonite online backup.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.540]   Let me tell you, there's two things
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.660]   that are critical to backup.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.860]   First of all, it's got to be automatic.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.940]   Because you know what?
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.620]   You're not going to remember to do it.
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.060]   You're just not.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.620]   It's got to be easy, right?
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.060]   Because if it's hard, you're not going to do it.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.500]   And the most important thing is it has to be offsite.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.180]   Now, let me make the case for why offsite.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.060]   You might be-- you're backing up right now.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.700]   You're burning into CDs or DVDs and you put them in a stack.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.140]   Maybe you're putting them in the bookshelf.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.340]   Or you've got an external hard drive.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.900]   This is probably the most common method, right?
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:49.500]   You back it up.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.500]   You've got an external hard drive hooked up by USB.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.140]   You're backing it up.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:52.900]   You feel good.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.340]   You've got two copies of everything.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.220]   And then what happens?
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.700]   Your house falls down.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.420]   There's a fire.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.620]   There's a flood.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.260]   Bad guys break in.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.780]   Happened to Francis Fort Kabbalah.
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.300]   He was working down in Buenos Aires,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.380]   rented a beautiful lovely house, had his computer there.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.340]   Francis' no fool was backing up regularly.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.660]   The bad guys broke in the house.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.580]   They stole the computer.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.220]   And they stole the backup.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.260]   And I shouldn't laugh because the guy was devastated.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.940]   He said 20 years worth of scripts lost.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.860]   He did not have-- yes, terrible story.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.300]   He did not have offsite backup.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.540]   That's why offsite is so important.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.260]   And I think carbonite really is the easiest solution.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.500]   In fact, you could try it right now and see how quickly.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.820]   Now, you could set it up.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.540]   You've got to have high speed internet.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.780]   Don't do this on dial up.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.740]   And of course, if you have a lot of data and not a very fast
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.220]   connection, it may take a while to back it up.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.460]   But once you've got it all backed up,
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.580]   then the updates are quick because it just updates changes.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.100]   It'll take a couple of weeks to try it.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.100]   And I think this is worth doing.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.620]   Go to carbonite.com and use the offer code TWIT.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.580]   You don't even need a credit card or anything.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.660]   Just you can just start using it for two weeks.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.020]   If after the two weeks-- and I really
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.820]   want you to do the trial-- if after the two weeks,
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.100]   you decide to buy two months off.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.220]   And by the way, two months off, it's already low prices.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.100]   Less than $5 a month for unlimited backup.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.780]   Every bit of your personal data inside your computer
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.740]   backed up automatically, encrypted using AES-256-bit
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.260]   encryption.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.660]   So it's absolutely private.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.700]   This is just a great solution.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.700]   They have an iPhone app, so you can see what's backed up.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.340]   Download the files if you need to.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.420]   You can log in to your carbonite account from any computer.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.580]   Mac or PC.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.620]   It's just a great solution.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.740]   Now, there are other companies doing this, and I want you.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.980]   I encourage you to try them all.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.980]   I think the first thing, though, that-- and people forget to do
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.900]   this, you should try is a restore.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.060]   It's a backup one file restore.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.380]   It's see how easy it is with carbonite and how hard it is
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.140]   with the other guys.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.580]   Carbonite.com, offer code, Twitch.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.300]   I'm a big fan, and I think you will be too.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.100]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.580]   We are talking tech news, the great Becky Worley, my good
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.020]   friend from the good old days at tech TVs here.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:58.340]   You know, I created a personal Facebook account.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.820]   It's like not my-- because I had public accounts was too full.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.940]   And you're on my personal account.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.860]   And I added just tech TV to people.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.380]   It's kind of fun.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.180]   They're all doing so great, aren't they?
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.020]   That's very stimulating.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.500]   I learn a lot from all the old alums, and it's a great
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.340]   network of people.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.660]   And we were the inmates running the asylum, kid who
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.780]   were running our own cable network.
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.300]   And--
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.380]   That's a really good way to describe it, because it's true.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:19.780]   It was--
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.020]   We didn't have much oversight.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.980]   We didn't-- I mean, it was cookie crazy.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.140]   But what I learned from the whole experience was that as
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:31.020]   insane as we were and just winging it, the billionaires
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.180]   responsible for the structure were crazier than us.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.660]   They were crazier than we were.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.180]   That was a good lesson.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.740]   Yeah, they were--
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.900]   My favorite thing is getting rid of Scott's show, which was
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.100]   the absolutely the most well-produced show.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.780]   Internet tonight with Scott Heriot and Michaela Pereira.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.060]   It's liquor than anything.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.780]   Brilliantly written, very funny.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.340]   It had that incredible-- what was his name?
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.740]   The Tech Guru?
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.380]   The security.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.140]   Security guard.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.980]   He was so funny.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.940]   And then out of the blue, Paul Allen apparently just took a
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.540]   wash and show.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.260]   I don't like that shot.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.500]   No, I know when they jumped the shark.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.860]   It was when Leo streaked the set.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.380]   You think it's my fault?
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.020]   It was.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.220]   I mean, granted, you were only showing a little bit about
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.580]   crack, but it was still--
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.940]   Well, now you'd be on the sexual offenders list if you
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.380]   could pull that--
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.300]   That's true.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.220]   I'd have to notify you.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.900]   You broke my phone, by the way.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.020]   It says, "Too many login attempts.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.220]   You must now give me your first born or something to unlock,
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.700]   sign in with your Google account.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.020]   All I can do is make an emergency call.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:29.860]   You broke my--
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.740]   The surf guru.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.100]   You have a--
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.460]   The surf guru.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:32.980]   Thank you.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.180]   The chat room knows all, doesn't it?
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.460]   So whatever happened to him, Ed, what was his name?
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.100]   He was an actor.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:38.900]   He did a lot of ads.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.980]   Very talented improv guy.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:47.220]   Hey, one story I really loved this week was the disgruntled
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.980]   ex-employee of a car company who remotely disabled.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.100]   Yeah, that's a great story.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:52.940]   All of them.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.380]   No, no, no.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.740]   This is the thing, though.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.340]   This is a real eye opener.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:56.940]   Yeah, totally.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.980]   Because this Texas Auto Center was putting a little black box,
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.700]   probably without anybody's knowledge, on every car that
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.380]   they carried the paper on.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.900]   So that if you didn't pay--
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.740]   Infal.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.900]   Infal-- they could disable your car or--
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.620]   I like this-- beep the horn, incest.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.100]   Yeah, I like the horn beeping one.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.100]   Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.300]   So--
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.180]   What's wrong with my car?
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:14.740]   The horn's beeping.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.420]   It's like the peaky alternative of the repo man.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.420]   Yeah, there's no repo man.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.780]   We just beep your horn, incest.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.380]   And disable your car.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.780]   You haven't paid--
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.380]   they should make-- oh, you want my phone again?
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.660]   Well, we want to go over these ads.
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.020]   All right, hold on.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:26.980]   I got to log in.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.620]   It should make-- it should say--
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.300]   they should have a horn--
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.620]   like, sit at your horn tune that says,
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.540]   like, defaulter, defaulter, pirate, pirate.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.060]   Something, brilliant.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:38.980]   I agree.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.180]   No, these black boxes are trying to put in--
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.340]   Is this common?
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.180]   They said for 10 years this has been-- they've been doing this.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.180]   They haven't had any problems, could they?
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.980]   They say in terms of this hacking.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.500]   OK, first of all, not a hack.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.340]   It is dignifying this guy and, frankly, inflating
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.620]   their security to call a hack.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.380]   The guy was fired right late off, disgruntled.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.860]   He asked his buddy for an login.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.900]   And his buddy who still worked there gave it to him.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.060]   That's not a hack.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.620]   No, no.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.380]   And then he, just to be clear about the story,
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.060]   because we might have backed into this.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.300]   So then the disgruntled employee
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.780]   disables 100 vehicles or more.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.820]   First he does names of people he doesn't like.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.140]   He actually looks at some individual names.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.380]   Oh, I don't like him.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.620]   I don't like his name.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.100]   Becky Worley, she sounds horrible.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.740]   And so either disables their car,
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.020]   or in the middle of the night makes the horn start going off.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.300]   And people couldn't even turn off the horn.
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.060]   They had to disconnect the battery.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:29.940]   That's how bad it was.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:57.800]   OK, so the Texas Auto
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   Center didn't exactly secure the damn thing.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   Well, anyway, so this is a scourge.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   It's terrible.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   And they're going to promote this idea.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   So that in fact you see all this,
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   all these, this chat about putting black boxes in the car
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   and all the crap they're giving Toyota.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   And they want the black box to keep talking about it.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   At some point they're going to use these black boxes.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   And they're going to use these black boxes.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   And they're going to use these black boxes.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   And they're going to use these black boxes.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   They're going to use these black boxes as a way to just track you
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   like a dog.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   I totally disagree.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   And they're going to download--
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.800]   And they're going to download--
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.800]   I'm enhancing perspective.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   No, no, not for that.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   It's like they're going to download for the tax purposes
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   of a broke state like California.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   They're going to download your black box and say,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   well, it looks like Becky Sped here and here and here.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   And here, send her five tickets.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   Here's one for $150.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   There's one for $200.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   There's one for $300.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   And boom, as of easy $500.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   Next.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   Do you think they'll do it for revenue?
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   Everything's for revenue.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   And the bottom line is all money in there.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   Conspiracy, theorists.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   No, conspiracy.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   This is just smart.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   I would do it.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   If he would do it, if he could, he would.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   Absolutely.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   We need money in this thing.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   So should Meg Whitman be governor of California?
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   Oh, no.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   No.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   Me.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   She's scary.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   If you've seen the viral videos they're doing,
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.800]   this is kind of creepy.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   You can't get your phone working again.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   Because I'm trying to do a show and you want me to log in.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   No, no, I need my--
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   I need my--
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   I need my--
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   I need my--
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   I need my--
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.800]   I'll chat a little bit then.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   Go ahead.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   You talk about--
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.680]   Meg Whitman, I don't-- for one thing, nobody has a prayer against Jerry Brown.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.960]   Why do you think a governor moonbeam is going to win?
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.960]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   You're kidding me.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.960]   Oh, here we go.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.960]   Another bet?
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.120]   You think Jerry Brown is going to win?
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.120]   I think--
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.120]   How much should the bet be?
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.920]   One of the bottle of Laoville Liscos.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   Okay.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.920]   Laoville Liscos.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   All right.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   A bottle of Laoville Liscos.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   You can beat him.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   I think Meg Whitman could be.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   Really?
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   She's got a lot of money.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   Here's what the deal is.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.000]   The Californians have shown a real pattern of stupidity.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.520]   Dad Jerry Brown.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.600]   So Jerry Brown is very personable.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   He is funny.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.160]   He's the Ralph Nader of governor.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   We all look at--
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.960]   No, he's way cuter.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.360]   I'm just saying.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   Is that how you determine who--
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.880]   That's when she's a woman.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.200]   That's the way all women vote.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.040]   I would have voted for Kennedy.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.880]   I mean, I'm just saying.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.880]   Actually, I would have voted for Kennedy.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   I mean, come on.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:26.160]   So anyway, Brown should be able to take her because I think she's going to-- I mean,
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.160]   I don't have anything against her.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.320]   I've never met her.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.720]   But I see her on TV.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.720]   I think she's--
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.960]   Let me just put her in that show.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.960]   She's slightly--
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:33.960]   Yeah, she's a little coarse.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.960]   Let me put it in that show.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.360]   Do you like something factual as opposed to-- he's cute.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.360]   She's coarse.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   Well, he's dated a celebrity.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   Who?
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.360]   We're in the Ron's debt.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.360]   See?
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.360]   Who does she date?
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   Magazine factor.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   I have no real me, DR.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   I think she really.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   No.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.360]   They didn't even put me on a set date.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   They didn't date.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.320]   No, but here, this is the woman who is CEO of eBay.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.440]   Buy Skype for $3.5 billion and forgets to buy the part of Skype.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.440]   The intellectual property part where you need that so otherwise they could just walk away.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   Yeah, that was dumb.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   That was-- yeah.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   You don't want that person running the state?
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   No.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   Why am I arguing for this?
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.160]   This is going to cause me a bottle of wine.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   It's going to-- yeah.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.920]   But Jerry Brown-- well, I like Jerry.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   I'll vote for Jerry.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.920]   I like Jerry.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   He's governor moonbeam.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.920]   He's governor moonbeam.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.920]   This is what we need in California.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.960]   He can work with the Democrats.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.720]   You know what the real problem is?
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.280]   The state of California is so structured that the governor-- there's nobody can-- look
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   who we've had.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.040]   We had the terminator as the governor and he became hated.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.440]   The state of California is a weak governor state.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.200]   The legislature is scared to death.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   It's all done by referendum.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   And you can't win.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.200]   Nobody who wins that job-- why would you want that job?
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.120]   Well, that's why Jerry Brown's actually a good candidate because he's had it and he
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.120]   has nothing-- he doesn't care.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.120]   He has nothing to prove.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   He just is trying to--
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.640]   Well, he won't prove anything because he doesn't have any power.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.240]   He's going to be fun to watch.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.960]   Why does Megan Whitman want to be?
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.960]   I guess we'll make women.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.960]   Make women's tech.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   Why does Megan--
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.640]   She has stepping stone to the presidency.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.360]   She has citizenship already.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   Yeah, I know.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   It's the work.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.840]   Do you remember the honor tried to make it legal for a non-American boy?
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.520]   I don't think that was really his doing.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.200]   I think it was.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   He has ambitions.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.600]   Well, he doesn't anymore.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   Great ambitions.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.240]   Yeah, not more.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.400]   Because you know why?
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   I can-- so many before him, he was broken on the rack of the California government.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   He got a smack down.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.920]   He'd have Wilson did OK as the governor.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   He did?
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.520]   What's he been up to these days?
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.840]   He's-- he's embedded in speech.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.560]   He and Gray Davis are in bed together.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.480]   No, Gray Davis was the worst.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.240]   You can't-- you know, OK.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   You guys are really in-space.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:39.520]   Point of point if you're going to name your kid and you want them to be a governor or
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.520]   any politician.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.520]   Don't do anything.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   Don't give him the name Gray.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.520]   I love that name.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   He'll steal so many people.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   Gray?
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.080]   He needs a black nor white.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:51.440]   OK, let's get back to real topics for the chat room gets out of control.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.440]   That's right.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   Yeah, it's all their fault.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.480]   So what is his Twitter to be available at anywhere?
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.960]   OK, so we're at South by Southwest last Monday.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.320]   The big speech at Monday is going to be "Eve Williams" at Twitter.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.120]   And the rumor is he's going to announce a way for Twitter to make money.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.200]   Monetization, finally.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.800]   The Holy Grail of Twitter.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:15.240]   Which is arguably the biggest.com launch in four years.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   Huge.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.640]   Finally, they figured out a way to make money.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.360]   So no, what does he announce?
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.360]   At Anywhere.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   Which is bad grammar, by the way.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.560]   I believe you as a writer would confer that.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.160]   With the @ sign, especially.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   At Anywhere.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   OK, anywhere.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   Where are you?
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   I'm at Anywhere.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.880]   So the idea is anywhere you go, you'll be able to log on with your Twitter credentials.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.400]   So it's Huffington Post or Yahoo or sign up a whole bunch of people.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.760]   You just log in with your Twitter post.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   But better yet--
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   Why would I want to do that?
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   Good question.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.680]   Better yet, you're reading a Huffpo article.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.760]   And you can tweet what you think of that article directly from The Huffington Post.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   Why?
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   I don't know.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   Well, it's written in that, right?
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.600]   This is like, my son's crazy tweets.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   Oh, I'm reading Huffposts this article stinks.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.480]   It's like, what?
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:06.200]   But what about monetizing journalism and all these paywall issues that are cropping up?
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   Well, I think that's the idea.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.760]   I mean, the New York Times is going to do it.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.240]   A lot of companies are going to do this.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.040]   ABC is like trying to figure it out.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.040]   Everybody is.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.040]   There's a little dig box on there.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.520]   It's very much the same, I think.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   You think you're right.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.520]   It's dig.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.520]   But then--
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.520]   Dig this.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.520]   Dig this.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:26.240]   I mean, just to play devil's avocado here, doesn't Twitter then become sort of like a PayPal
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:31.280]   that creates a micro-payment situation and your identity and your credit card could all
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.280]   be on fire.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.280]   Well, it's more than that.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.880]   You're not even getting global enough.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.560]   I think the real battle and then Facebook's involved, Google's involved and Twitter's involved
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.560]   is for internet-- what I call internet namespace.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.800]   Right now when somebody says, who are you on the internet?
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.320]   You say Beckyworley.com or John says channeldevorect.com.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.880]   What Twitter wants you to say is @buto-beworley.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.920]   What Facebook wants you to say is Facebook.com/beckyworley.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.360]   What Google Connect, friend Connect wants you to say whatever is the Google profile.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:04.040]   So they all would like to be that address book, the definitive place you are on the internet.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.640]   And that's what @anywhere is all about is that, well, you'll suddenly be @beworley and
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.600]   John will suddenly be @the-- what is it?
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.960]   The real devorect.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.120]   And I'll be @leo-l-oport, the one and only.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.080]   Yeah, well, I'm the real devorect.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.720]   Did somebody else get John C. devorect?
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.720]   Pastards.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.280]   And they'll give it back to you?
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.480]   No, the Twitter guys won't even give me a certified verified--
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.160]   You know, this is good.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.160]   I got it, right?
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.160]   You did?
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.160]   Well, yeah, I got verified.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.240]   It just happened one day.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:38.080]   And then I changed my profile information because it was just a joke.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.520]   And then I thought, well, if they're going to be verified, I should have like my actual
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.520]   who I am.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.520]   And it took away the verify.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.760]   It's like, we don't know.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.760]   Thank you.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.760]   Yeah, I know they have.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.600]   We tried-- Robert Scobel and I tried to get into the secret Twitter party at South
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   by Southwest.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.600]   You couldn't get in?
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.960]   We were told, no, I'm sorry, you can't come.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.960]   What?
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:57.960]   You couldn't-- wait a minute.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   Let me get this straight.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.720]   So I'm hearing correctly.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.760]   You lealed apart with all your gear and you're like promoting stuff, since you had a one
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.880]   man promotion band floating around.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.360]   And you went to the Twitter party--
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.520]   It's Robert Scobel who probably was single-handedly made Twitter.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.280]   And Scobel who probably single-handedly made Twitter.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.280]   Right.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   You also did Twitter.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.760]   You went to the Twitter party and they told you guys to screw yourselves.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.120]   We tweeted, actually.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:26.440]   We direct messaged a person, an organizer, and she said-- I can't remember who it was,
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.080]   but Robert did this.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.920]   And she said, no, I'm sorry, there's no room.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.200]   There's no room or something.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.080]   And then Jason hears about it and Jason comes over and says, I'll get you in.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.080]   I said, no, screw that.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.080]   I'm not going to go.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   I'm only Jason Calicansis bitch.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.080]   Oh, I'm kidding.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.080]   Yeah, totally.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.080]   It's embarrassing.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   It's embarrassing.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.000]   Oh, Jason will get me in.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   They should have welcomed you.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.960]   They should have-- no, I don't care.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.960]   It's fun.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   You know what?
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.960]   It's just fun to rag on them.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.960]   Well-- I love Twitter.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:53.960]   I use Twitter like crazy.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:54.960]   Well, they don't really know.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.960]   You know what's sad?
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:56.960]   They don't like you.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   I don't care if they like.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.000]   They probably should have sued them the minute they came out with their product.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   And it's a way now.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.640]   So here's what I'm really sad about.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.080]   I love Google Buzz.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.480]   I know I'm the only one who does.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   You are.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.440]   And in fact, it's apparent now because no one else is on Google Buzz.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:14.160]   It's like a-- I hear crickets when I go there.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.160]   And it makes me so sad.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.360]   You have a short window.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   What happened with this world?
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.360]   You do.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.360]   And this is Google.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.760]   This isn't just some guy coming along.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.960]   This is Google.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.880]   Google somehow fumbled Buzz so badly that now nobody will use it.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:33.200]   I actually find this very comforting and refreshing because I find that anything Apple and Google
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.000]   do, I can get coverage on the network level.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.600]   But really interesting things that smaller people do.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.600]   It's really hard to settle.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.600]   Because they don't have the name.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.800]   And so the fact that Google can seriously screw something up is comforting in sort of
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.200]   an open market sense of things.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   It is.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.120]   And it shows the power of Twitter.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:57.560]   I mean, Twitter is so dominant that even a company like Google can't march in and say,
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.680]   you know, we want to play in this space.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.160]   They just-- they can't.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.680]   Well, did you ever use Buzz?
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   No.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   No.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   Did you ever use Buzz?
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   I checked it out for a little bit.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.680]   I followed a few people.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.680]   And I just-- I actually found the threads were--
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.680]   I don't want the time.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.760]   Did June and Trite, but not all?
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   Overwhelming.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760]   Overwhelming.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.760]   I just don't need that much data.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.360]   I need someone who can edit that data and tell me what's important.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.480]   So I think maybe Google did it for me.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.080]   It's like Leo Buzz.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.960]   Yeah, that's-- maybe that's what happened.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.440]   It's like my Buzz.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:34.920]   Have you seen the campaigns cities are doing to get Google to put in Gigabit-- we're going
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.920]   to talk about that in just a second.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.720]   Topeka renamed itself to Google Kansas for the month of March.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.720]   I promise to name the children--
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.720]   Yeah, talk about brown nocers.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.720]   Google.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.280]   Well, I've made a promise too.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.960]   I'm going to tell you what that is in just a second.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.960]   Before I do, though, I do want to mention Audible.com.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.560]   See, we're trying to get it here in Petaluma.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.280]   And if Google comes to Petaluma, I will do something better than giving them a bottle
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.920]   of Leoville wine.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.840]   But before we do that, I do want to mention my friends at audible.com.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.480]   Audible is a great bookstore.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.360]   70,000 wonderful books you can listen to.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.120]   There's so many times-- I was talking to Francine Hardaway at South by Southwest.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.920]   Very nice woman.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.800]   And she said, because of you, I knew about Audible, but I didn't subscribe.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.440]   I heard all the plugs for books.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.120]   And I thought, well, all right, I'll try it.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.680]   And she said, I have rediscovered reading.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.600]   I didn't have time to read it nowadays.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:33.720]   But we all have time when we're in the car or at the gym.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   Just times when you couldn't hold a book, but you could actually get some reading done.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   And that's what I love about Audible.com.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:47.160]   I load up my iPod, your iPhone, your Kindle, your Zoom, and put great books on there.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.800]   And then whenever I've got some downtime, I can listen.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.840]   You remember Nathaniel West, don't you, John C. de Vorac?
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.560]   Author of Miss Lonely Hearts, The Day of the Locust.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.640]   But how many people remember Eileen McKenny?
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   Nope.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.640]   No.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:08.960]   He was my second-grade teacher.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:14.120]   Eileen McKenny was a literary heroine, the inspiration for her sister Ruth's humorous
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.640]   stories, My Sister Eileen.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:23.080]   She became a play, a film, TV show, and in fact, inspired by Bernstein's musical Wonderful
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.960]   Town.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.240]   She and her sister lived in a basement apartment in the village with street-level window into
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.960]   which men frequently peered.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:30.960]   Ooh.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.640]   Osmond and wife were intimate with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker, Katherine White,
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   S.J.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.200]   Pearlman, Bennett Surf, and many of the literary, theatrical, and movie notables of the era.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.600]   I think you failed to say that she's the wife of Nathaniel West.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.600]   There it is.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   You are brilliant.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.600]   There's the connection, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.600]   Oh, sorry.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:55.640]   The new book is called Lonely Hearts, the screwball world of Nathaniel West and Eileen McKenny?
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.840]   You picked right up on that.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.200]   You're brilliant.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   This is a neat new book.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   I don't know.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:05.040]   You have to, maybe this isn't for everybody, but if you're into this kind of great literary
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:10.400]   era and the great bonemos and witticisms, this is a fun book.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.080]   But you know, okay, you don't want that.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.240]   Can I recommend another book that I'm just finishing?
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.760]   Is transformed my vision?
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.000]   You should read this, John C. de Vorek.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.440]   Daniel Suarez is demon.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.800]   You want a conspiracy theory?
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.680]   I don't know why I'm being associated with conspiracy theories.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.680]   Wasn't that what you're talking about?
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.680]   The rice with them?
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.320]   No, no, we talk about deconstruct the news.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.640]   The Illuminati and the great global conspiracy.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:37.640]   No.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   Okay.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.680]   This actually is kind of scary.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:46.720]   It's a murder mystery about a very famous game designer who passes away brain cancer
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:51.360]   but leaves behind a demon computer program which takes over the world.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.360]   This is a very popular book.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.360]   You like this book?
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.440]   Oh, my God.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:01.800]   It underscores our vulnerability as we all become more interconnected and dependent on
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.240]   computers.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:07.680]   This book just scares the pants off of you because basically, if you think about it,
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.160]   it's completely credible.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.120]   Suarez is great because he really obviously understands technology.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.980]   So it's not one of those books where they have kind of boneheaded pseudo technology
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:17.980]   phrases.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.560]   This guy really knows what he's talking about and it is such a good book.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.480]   Can I make a quick audible plug?
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.480]   You make a recommendation.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   Yes.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.280]   It has nothing to do with an individual book.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.000]   I asked my mother the other day, "Why have you stopped doing your daily walks?"
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.880]   And she said, "Because I stopped subscribing to books on tape."
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.640]   And I said, "Well, let's get you hooked up with audible."
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.040]   And it motivates her.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:42.320]   She only listens to her audible books when she's working out.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.720]   And so if she's got a great page turner, it's definitely going.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.120]   It gets her back walking with the headphones on.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:55.080]   And it's a great way to motivate you to work out in a reward-based system if the story
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   is the reward.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   It's been great for me.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.640]   I go to the gym every day now because I can't wait to read to listen to my books.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.800]   And when you have a book like Demon, you're exactly right.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.680]   You cannot put this down.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.640]   You can listen to the review.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.000]   I heard about this book from Leo Laporta and his podcast.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   It seemed interesting, so I gave it a go.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.360]   Damn good book.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   Leo was right.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.760]   Even though this book is supposed to be fiction, it seems like it could happen in today's
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:17.840]   highly computerized world.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.760]   I read the book over two days while driving across country.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   I was so impressed with it.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.440]   I'm downloading the sequel Freedom.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.480]   Leo, are you listening?
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.280]   This is written in the style of Dan Brown on a good day.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   Totally riveting.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.280]   I agree.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   It's really well written.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.240]   By the way, credit to Tom Merritt, who's going to join us in a little bit.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.280]   He was a guy who suggested I read this.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   It was a pick for Tom and Veronica Sword and Laser Podcast.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.880]   Anyway, there's so many great books.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:43.880]   This is the point and one of the things that really happens when audible listeners get
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.280]   together is we...
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   It's like always like a book group.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   Hey, did you listen to this?
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   Hey, did you listen to this?
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.600]   And you're always looking for great books to listen.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.600]   70,000 choices.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.480]   I'm going to give you a way you can get two books free right now.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:00.640]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.520]   You'll sign up for the platinum plan, which is two books a month.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.360]   That's about right for me.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.640]   Easily going to do two books a month.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.800]   That's without a long commute.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.080]   I know people have several platinum plans, but two books a month and your first two are
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.000]   free and even if you cancel and you can cancel at any time, you get to keep those books forever.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.480]   Another thing I like about Audible.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.000]   When I used to rent books, you'd send them back and that would be it.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.120]   Audible, your library is your library forever.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.800]   I have over 300 books that I can go back to at any time and listen to again.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.000]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.600]   Please do yourself a favor.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   Give it a try.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   You're going to love it.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.200]   Oh, a new one for Michael Lewis.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.960]   Oh, I've got to read this.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   Remember Liars Poker?
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   Wasn't that a good book, John DeGeneres?
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.640]   This new book by Lewis is supposed to be fantastic.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.080]   It's called The Big Short.
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.800]   It's the story of the economic meltdown of last year.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.040]   God, putting that on my list.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.960]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.720]   So apparently Lisa Ticklepink is tweeting.
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.720]   Oh, she is?
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.520]   Of course she is.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.520]   It's the presses.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.520]   Right.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:09.120]   This is a huge story just in Lisa Ticklepink says Leo Laport, ha ha, fantastic.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.520]   I love that you're watching Twit Live.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.160]   I'm being naughty in class.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.080]   If I flunk, it's Leo's fault.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.080]   She's a student.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.560]   I thought she was a middle-aged woman.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.160]   You are so naughty, Liza.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.680]   She says I'm fading into the background with all that brown.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.440]   She wants me to wear pink.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.440]   Oh.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:27.440]   I think it would look good in pink.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.440]   Thanks, big man.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.440]   No, she's a big man.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   Do we have pink?
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.160]   Does anybody do any guys wear pink?
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.160]   I mean, preppy guys.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.160]   Oh, preppy.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   Summertime.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   Look at John.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   It's wearing striped yellow.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   But this isn't pink.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   No, but it's like pink.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   Is it?
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.160]   You think so?
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   It's the equivalent.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.160]   It's the yellow equivalent of pink.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.160]   Oh, I know.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.160]   Yellow is the new pink.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.160]   Didn't you know that?
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.160]   So while you guys were at South...
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.160]   Well, you were at South by Southwest.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   I've never been.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.160]   Have you been?
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.160]   No, because I...
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.160]   Well, I don't want to make a big deal about it.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:58.520]   It's the biggest party in the world where nobody gets laid.
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.520]   Is that true?
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520]   Yep.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.520]   What was that?
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.520]   Because it's a bunch of guys.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.520]   There's actually quite a few...
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.880]   It's the sexiest computer conference I've ever been to.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.120]   There are a lot of women there.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.040]   Yeah, but it's a very attractive woman.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.040]   So is that why you liked it?
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.040]   Mm-hmm.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.040]   Just getting that straight.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.040]   I'm going to straighten that out.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.240]   I don't want to make a big deal because I was someplace where there...
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.240]   Where were you?
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.480]   I was at the home and house where a show in Chicago.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   Oh, man!
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.480]   I'm just saying!
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   Oh, man!
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.480]   You trumped me, man.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480]   I've never been a good one.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480]   I mean...
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480]   I didn't get laid there.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.480]   Oh, dude.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.840]   I was sitting in the bathroom and I vacuumed.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.840]   I found a great new vacuum from Panasonic.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840]   Oh, yeah?
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840]   Good mop.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840]   It has a salad spinner in the bucket.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   A mop and salad spinner?
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.040]   A vacuum with a salad spinner or a mop with a salad spinner?
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.840]   No, that's been around for years.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840]   That's crazy.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840]   That's crazy.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.840]   That's crazy.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.840]   You know, I've seen that.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.840]   The spinner goes...
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.840]   They said "seen on TV."
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.160]   So it's brand new as "seen on TV."
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.160]   That's good stuff.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.160]   But I found it interesting.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.160]   Well, why is this?
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.720]   Well, I want to hear about the vacuum cleaner.
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.720]   You can watch it all the time.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]   Did you get a sample?
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720]   No, I don't go.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720]   I don't roll like that.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.720]   It doesn't side off.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.200]   You roll like that, she says.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.760]   You can pull all the pieces out and wash them all independently so that your dog's
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.760]   smell does not pervade through the home as you vacuum.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.120]   You know, people say I smell like a dog and I just...
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.760]   I don't.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   I have not noticed that.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   Who said just smell like a dog?
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.160]   She just told me my dog's smell doesn't penetrate.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.160]   Go ahead.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.160]   What I noticed was that...
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.400]   I don't think I smell like a dog.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.520]   We don't want to see this on the stream.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.800]   The twit that we did last summer where it was 103 degrees of hair.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.240]   I smelled like a dog.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.240]   I smelled like a dog.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.800]   I smelled like a dog.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.920]   CES, I didn't notice any deficit of innovation this year.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.440]   I didn't notice that there was any like result.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   What is that?
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.440]   That is faint praise.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   Well, I didn't...
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:53.240]   I expected that R&D budgets would have been absolutely slashed because of the economy.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.920]   But at the "Homan Houseware Show," it was a dearth of innovation, aka nothing, baby.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.360]   A dearth of innovation.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.360]   So there was nothing but you said the Panasonic had a good vacuum there.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.360]   That's my point.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:11.480]   I found a mop with a salad spinner, a silicone pod to boil vegetables in, and a cupcake
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.480]   maker.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.240]   Whereas I did not see a major drop down in innovation at CES and I found it fascinating
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:27.400]   that technology and consumer electronics still get so they were not affected by the recession
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400]   as much as something.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.400]   That's because of Moore's law.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.400]   You can't stop.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.840]   It's like you're on a treadmill and you can't stop running.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.720]   So there's always innovation showing up.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   Otherwise, you just go to...
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:39.320]   Let's put a Pablo in Walnut Creek.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.560]   I have that clip too.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.760]   It's good at Pablo in Walnut Creek.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.480]   I'm writing the book all the time.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.560]   I have the virtual Dvorak soundboard.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.280]   So any time John's not here, he just runs those clips.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.360]   I could just play these clips.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.120]   That wasn't off the soundboard, by the way.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.720]   That's another noise.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:05.120]   I don't remember all the details.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.880]   So in other words, this is what he thinks of your analysis, Becky.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880]   I know.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]   He's playing old Dvorak clips.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.880]   You know what?
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.600]   I'm the only chick that comes on Twit that you two can abuse.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.000]   And I take that as great, great.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   I'm not looking at it.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.360]   I can't believe you're going with this, Becky, which is that innovation lives in the tech
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.360]   sector.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.720]   We're in the home and houseware sector.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.240]   It's a little bit slower.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   And what other sectors?
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.160]   What do you...
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.160]   Let's ask this question.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.520]   What were you expecting to find?
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.520]   We'll call Catch Ford.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520]   She invented the Swiffer.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.680]   I don't know.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.880]   I think the Swiffer invented the Swirler, by the way.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.680]   Was there any robot cleaner uppers?
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   Yes.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   Well, then that's innovative.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.680]   It puts the Swiffer on a robot and it swifts your house via robotics.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.080]   Is there any new Roombas coming down the pike?
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.200]   No, there's a Nido, which debuted at CES.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.200]   They didn't even...
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.760]   I didn't give a rip about the home and houseware show.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.680]   And the big innovation there, it vacuums in straight lines as opposed to circular patterns.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.840]   Well, that is one of the things people don't like.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   I don't know why I'm saying this.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.920]   You look like you're drunk when you run the Roomba.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:16.800]   There's these swirly patterns on your carpet, these random swirly patterns, and people want
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.440]   it to look like a newly mowed lawn with straight lines.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.200]   And so that actually is a consumer complaint.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.200]   With the Roomba?
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.840]   With the Roomba is it looks like a random walk vacuum, which it is.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.400]   It looks like a drunk vacuum to your house.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.240]   Nobody wants that.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.240]   Nobody wants that.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   Who could have pretty...
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.440]   What drunk was in here vacuuming your house?
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.400]   Could you imagine an NFL game where the field looked like Roomba had mowed it?
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.920]   But who would have thought designing the Roomba?
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   I mean, here you are.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920]   You're really...
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920]   I mean, this is exciting.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920]   You've got a robotic vacuum.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920]   This is huge.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.920]   It's really a sweep or not a vacuum.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.920]   Okay.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920]   Whatever.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920]   But it's exciting.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.920]   It does have a vacuum.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   But who would have said, "Oh, wait a minute.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   There's one problem.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   The pattern it leaves behind looks like you're drunk."
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:02.400]   Well, the mechanics behind it were all based on the bots that they used to find bombs.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.400]   Right.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.400]   It's a perfect...
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400]   You know, because they need to find everything.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:10.360]   And so it's guaranteed over a certain period of time to hit every no-concranay, so to speak.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.480]   Oh, that's too bad.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.640]   Let's take another call.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.920]   Well, you might as well do the...
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   It's time in...
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.120]   Do you like the time?
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.120]   It's 6.3 a.m. and...
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:28.360]   This was the sound effect that we used to begin every Dvorak on computers show.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.000]   The time is now 2 a.m.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.640]   In Bakava, Belgian Congo.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.080]   The home of the jungle telegraph.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:42.480]   They'd like to say hello to Ungat Unga-ump and Mrs. Oump and all the boys up at the transmitter.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.480]   It's just non-sequitur.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.680]   John loved that.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.120]   I just found it to be amusing.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.120]   I found it.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   I did too.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.120]   As did I.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   Soundboards are amazing.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.680]   Have you guys done the Jersey Shore soundboard?
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.680]   From that show?
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.680]   I'm gonna find that now.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.880]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.880]   So the Jersey Shore...
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.880]   Do you watch that?
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880]   No, she's playing it right now.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.880]   Do you watch the Jersey Shore?
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.120]   I watched it twice and I'm still feeling dirty.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.120]   I mean...
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.120]   I've never seen it.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.120]   I saw a few minutes of it.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.120]   What is it?
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.120]   Is it...
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.120]   It's a bunch of...
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.120]   It stinks.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.120]   It's a place where...
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.120]   It...
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:19.920]   Adolescence of Italian-American descent celebrate their sexuality.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:24.520]   I would send that picture of my **** and pack a bubble to them and say, "Chew on this."
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   It's kinda old school.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   It's like my ass.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   Oh, geez.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   Let's see if we've kinda gone off the heat-bin here.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.440]   Maybe she can get back to the news.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.440]   No, I...
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.440]   We'll cut your hair while you're sleeping.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.440]   It advocates the use of...
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.520]   So these are just enhancing metabolic agents for lifting weights.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   You know what I...
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520]   I don't like this show.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520]   The reason I don't like this show...
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   There's a lot of tanning.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520]   There's a lot of tanning.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.760]   It's because these people know what they're doing.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.000]   It's like self-conscious, right?
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   They know they're...
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   They're made now.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   All reality shows are that way.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   No.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   Really?
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Yo, bitch, keep talking.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.840]   I'll ******* rock you.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.040]   It's where other adolescents learn not to hit women.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.040]   Guess I had sex like hello.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.440]   You're gonna have sex if you're into somebody.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.440]   It's natural.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.080]   It's a good voice.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.080]   That's a clip you should use.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.080]   I can use that one.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   I'm gonna save that one.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.080]   I'm gonna save that one.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.080]   How are you?
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.080]   It's natural.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.080]   Wear a dong bikini.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.080]   It's a little bit more classier.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.080]   That's so much more classier.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.080]   A little more classier.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.400]   Okay, so I haven't watched this show.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.400]   I don't know this show.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   But the clips are good.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.160]   God, I'm enjoying it now.
