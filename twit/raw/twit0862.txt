[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   It's time for Tweth this weekend.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.600]   Tech, we got a great panel for you.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.920]   Editor-in-Chief from CNET, Connie Guillelmo is here.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.160]   Turns out I didn't realize this.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.360]   She was also there at the beginning of Wired Magazine.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.920]   We'll talk a little bit about that from WGBH in Boston.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.640]   And of course, Mac Break Weekly, Andy Inaco stops by.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.200]   And from theregister.co.uk.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.280]   Ian Thompson will talk about the mainstreaming of crypto,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.400]   the web telescope receiving its first photos.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.360]   The Samsung Galaxy tab, it's so big.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.760]   Is it a laptop replacement?
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.840]   And France says, go ahead, take our meta.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.280]   It's all coming up next on Tweth.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.600]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.120]   From people you trust.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.680]   This is Tweth.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.240]   This is Tweth this weekend tech, episode 862.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.880]   Recorded Sunday, February 13, 2022, a game old bird.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.440]   A reminder to all our Tweth listeners,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.560]   it's our annual survey time once again
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.120]   to help us understand our audience a little bit better.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.800]   We want to make your listening experience better.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.240]   And it also helps us sell advertising.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.400]   We don't want to track you, so it's completely voluntary.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.960]   But if you can take a few minutes to let us know a little more
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.520]   about you, we sure appreciate it.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.880]   Go to twit.tv/survey22.

[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.040]   the show where we cover the week's tech news
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.600]   with a panel of brilliant journalists.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.200]   We're thrilled to get Connie Guglielmo back
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.840]   on our microphones editor in chief who've seen that big shot.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.680]   Look at that beautiful set.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.360]   It's marvelous.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.000]   Thank you for being here, Connie.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.800]   My pleasure.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.320]   I say that because I was always jealous of CNET's CES studio.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.840]   It always looks beautiful.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.480]   Well, not for the past two years, because we haven't gone.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.040]   You miss it.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.440]   I'm going to ask you about that in a second.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.000]   But first, let's say hi to Annie and Iko.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.760]   You know him as host of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.160]   He's here slumming with us on Twit.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.200]   It's nice to have you.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.760]   No, no.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.040]   It's nice to have something to do professionally on a Sunday,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.880]   because otherwise it's like, you know what?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.480]   It's three, but I bet I could sleep for another two hours.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.520]   This is a good day to shop, because the streets will be empty.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.960]   Yes.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.640]   Because everybody's watching some game or other.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.920]   Andy, of course, the host of the material podcast,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.080]   regular Mac Break Weekly and regular WGBH in Boston,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.200]   and other things.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.560]   This would have been a good time, Andy,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.680]   to announce the launch of your giant new project.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.160]   But--
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.320]   Yes.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.000]   In the middle of the Super Bowl, when nobody's
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   paying attention to anything--
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.080]   That's exactly--
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.280]   I would be consistent with my business acumen and self-promotion,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.040]   but I'll give you that.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.960]   Also with us, Ian Thompson from theregister.co.uk,
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.960]   my favorite Brit.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.160]   Hi, Ian.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.640]   Hey there.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.080]   How's it going?
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.920]   You're the Ted Lasso of Tech.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.280]   No, wait, I got stalkers.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.960]   I got it wrong.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.360]   But anyway, welcome.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.640]   Good to have you.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.240]   Always fun.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.760]   You don't care about hand-agg or whatever it is.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.800]   They call this Super Bowl.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.600]   Oh, well, do you run a kicky throwy game?
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   It's fun.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.800]   I'm just astonished that you managed to stretch one-hour game
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.280]   out to four hours of adverts.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.120]   You said that on Twitter, and I had to point out
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.920]   that somebody did the math.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.080]   It's quartz, actually.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.920]   And there's only 11 minutes of action
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.200]   in a normal football game.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.440]   It doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.760]   The way you've got the rules set up,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.640]   it seems to be an awful lot of just hanging around,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.560]   waiting for singers, dancers, advertisers
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.480]   to get the money in.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.440]   If you go to a American football game,
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.280]   and I noticed this at a 49ers game,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.560]   there's a guy with big orange gloves.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   They go to his elbow, giant orange gloves.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.120]   And I asked my wife, who's that?
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.920]   She said, that's the TV timeout guy.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.240]   And they watch-- this guy's got big orange gloves,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.360]   because he is listening to New York.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.960]   And they say, OK, stop.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.920]   We got a commercial.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.360]   And he goes, wait, with his big orange gloves.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.440]   And then they watch him until he says, OK, you could begin again.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.600]   And they're just standing around.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.640]   TV commercials are the most important, as you can tell.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.080]   In fact, I think, Connie, you agree
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.160]   that TV commercials are the most important part of the Super Bowl.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.720]   Well, somebody has to pay all of those salaries.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.760]   And for whatever it costs to rent a stadium,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.480]   I don't know.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.440]   That's a lot of money.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.040]   Do you want to know how much it costs to buy an ad on the Super Bowl?
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.560]   Sure.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.720]   $6 and 1/2 million for 30 seconds.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.080]   Oh, good grief.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.440]   $6 and 1/2 million for 30 seconds.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.600]   And AT&T--
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.080]   Apparently, they're asking.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.720]   Apparently, used this opportunity
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.600]   to announce that their 5G was five gigs.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.360]   Apparently, they're still asking their dancers
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.600]   to dance for the exposure, not to get paid for free.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   Which is shameful, you know?
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.920]   Anyway, that's fine.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.640]   It's an American pastime.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.800]   And so, of course, capitalism rules.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.960]   It's number one.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.320]   It's the number one job of capitalism.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.520]   So--
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.800]   Can I just say in American football's defense
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.160]   that what our guys throw to the ground and appear to be injured,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.280]   they are actually suffering lifelong debilitating
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.120]   rear-regulating injury.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.480]   Good boy.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.200]   Not like this blue by knee, by knee, by knee.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.680]   For American football fans, when we watch UK football,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.080]   we watch soccer.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.280]   The guy is running fast.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.840]   Somebody touches him.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.600]   He falls to the ground and rides in agony.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.640]   We think, what is he talking about?
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.120]   But you see, there's the rub.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.160]   You're watching soccer, which is basically a game of people.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.800]   Yes, who will cheerfully dive in front of the referee
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.840]   if they think he gets from a point.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.680]   Rugby, on the other hand, which makes you proud.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.080]   Oh, you can really get hurt.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.640]   I've seen a guy with his ear half ripped off.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.480]   He's got to get back on his head, run back out onto the field.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.920]   Exactly.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   Another one punched his kneecap back into place after getting it.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.400]   Oh!
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   Yeah, at least the football players are on the side.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.840]   So, yeah, soccer players are on the side,
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.400]   but rugby players, man, they're on their own.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.400]   You go out there and good luck.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.480]   Well, they've got a British rugby team
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.760]   and an American football team to play each other's games.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.040]   And they both came out of it saying that each person had it harder.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.040]   Because the rugby players, like, with all this armour on,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.000]   you can really muck someone up.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.720]   And the American football players, I'm not wearing armour.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.360]   I'm going to get really mucked up.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.880]   Get hurt.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.480]   I remember, it wasn't that long ago, maybe, I don't know, 20 years ago,
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:14.400]   the very first technology advertisement on the Super Bowl.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.520]   And I think it was Petstot.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.560]   No, it wasn't Petstot.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.120]   Didn't Apple do the 19-80 thing?
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.400]   Exactly. Super Bowl.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.880]   Yes.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.800]   OK, that would be a tech advertiser.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.160]   You're right.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.240]   I don't know if that was the first one, though.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.360]   Well, I think it was.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.680]   And there was a long drought after that.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.160]   Maybe I'm thinking the first internet advertiser on the Super Bowl.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:41.080]   Because really, Apple IBM, the big computer companies,
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.000]   probably have been doing that for a long time.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.840]   Petstot.com still, though, had a great tag line, which is,
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.760]   because pets can't drive.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.280]   Have a shot.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.920]   I think I'm trying to remember the-- I guess what I should say
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.240]   is really the first .com, right?
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.640]   That would be more appropriate.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.640]   Because then you know the internet has come of age when
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.160]   they have .coms.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.680]   Now they're all over the Super Bowl.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.680]   I mean, that's all you see is .com advertisers.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.320]   Here's a list from Business Insider of eight .coms
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.280]   that spent millions on Super Bowl ads and no longer exist.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.880]   And number one, look at the doggy.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   Hold the mic.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.160]   Petstot.com.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.760]   I have also bizarre idea.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.760]   I mean, it's all level of Uber for bad economics.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.320]   But yes, it's--
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.040]   In 2000, there was a ill-fated Super Bowl commercial
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   for a company called epidemic.com.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.760]   I don't think they would do well these days.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.960]   There's a New York Times article from the weekend
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.640]   basically calling it the crypto bowl for all the commercials
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.040]   this year.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   They all came off blockchain at some point.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.160]   I think-- actually, I'm curious.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.360]   Maybe this may be our first topic of the day.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.480]   Crypto really has gone mainstream.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   In fact, there is a stadium in Los Angeles,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.160]   not where the Super Bowls have even played.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.240]   That's so so far stadium.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.800]   But the old stable center is now crypto.com arena.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.080]   Crypto has gone mainstream.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.240]   I worry that there are a lot-- that means
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   there are going to be a lot more suckers.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.640]   But maybe whenever I say that, my kids say, OK, boomer.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.120]   Connie, where do you come down on NFT's blockchain crypto?
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.200]   I mean, your point is correct.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.280]   They have become much more mainstream.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.040]   People know what crypto is, and they know what Bitcoin is,
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.800]   or Coinbase, and all that stuff.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.360]   Do I think, though, that means that there's
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   massive opportunities for scams?
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.400]   Absolutely.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.880]   There are no experts who can tell you--
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.320]   there are purported experts.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.760]   I think we were going to talk about some scamsters online
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.000]   who claim that they can give you advice on how to buy and sell
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.480]   crypto.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.360]   But it's the early days.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.600]   It's the Wild Wild West.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.280]   And in the Wild Wild West, who makes the money?
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.640]   Most of the people are the people selling the picks
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.720]   and shovels, right?
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.040]   Not the people who are doing the shoveling.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.280]   So it's early days, and there's going to be a lot of scams.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.720]   And I think because it's early days,
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.240]   a lot of the people, including maybe some Super Bowl
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.800]   advertisers who are really promoting crypto and NFTs
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.000]   and all this are the people who got in early who
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.840]   want to sell and make dollars off of the crypto,
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.520]   as opposed to people who really are believers.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.240]   But then there are.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.360]   And I agree there are the true believers.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.720]   And certainly, blockchain is not going to go away.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.960]   Cryptocurrencies, who knows maybe the future of currency.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.080]   I'm not saying that.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.480]   I just think that a lot of speculation is going on,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   and that means risk.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.840]   The other big advertiser on the Super Bowl--
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.200]   it's been on NFL all season-- is fantasy sports and betting,
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.720]   gambling.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.200]   I think they go hand in hand.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.560]   Gambling, crypto.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.440]   Two sides of the same coin.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.520]   You think so?
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.080]   Andy, you agree?
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.680]   Well, one of the biggest advertisers of all,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.080]   like big-time sports, has always been financial services
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.040]   companies.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.160]   And this is part of crypto is not just
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.520]   the idea of people who--
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.800]   investors who are trying to get-- or even basic people who
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.040]   are trying to get in and trying to make money off
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.640]   of crypto exchanges.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.560]   But also, it's an opportunity for all of these exchanges
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.640]   to get in new customers.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.440]   And make money not necessarily off of cryptocurrency itself,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.360]   but off of all the fees and services
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.120]   that they can charge investors.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.640]   So there's-- and on top of everything else,
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.120]   although I agree 100%, that there's
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.880]   a very, very double-digit percentage,
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.920]   I think, that's motivated by we need
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.480]   to have a new wave of suckers come in
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   to prop up the earlier waves of suckers
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.360]   and the initial waves of now millionaires and billionaires.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.960]   But a lot of it is that we are really still at the age
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.080]   where people understand a lot.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.040]   It's still absolutely mumbo-jumbo to so many people.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.880]   Last week on Boston and PR, I talked about the--
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.080]   of course, about the crypto laundering arrests.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.280]   And I thought that I had laid the groundwork very, very well,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.520]   but the basic understanding of what a digital currency is,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.120]   what a crypto-based currency is, and how it works.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.680]   It's kind of like trying to explain
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.600]   personal computers to people in 1978.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.240]   They just need-- they don't understand the verbs,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.320]   the nouns, the adverbs, or anything.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.760]   You really do have to-- and as part of our responsibility,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.480]   I think, as tech commentators, to make sure
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.000]   that people understand that here is what a single Bitcoin is.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.600]   Like, no, it isn't just like moving numbers
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.560]   from one account to another account.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.080]   It is an actual thing that you can drop down a sewer
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.400]   and lose completely.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.280]   All this basic stuff.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.080]   So if it makes people more aware and hopefully puts,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.160]   by next year, a lot more people on their guard
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.720]   that this is just a system where you put $100 in
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.160]   and you get $2,000 out the next month,
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.760]   that hopefully will be a good thing.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.160]   And I suppose you could have made the same argument.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.920]   You said financial services.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   Insurance ads are all over.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.960]   NFL football.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.640]   And I suppose you could make the same argument.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.560]   Insurance is a gamble, too, right?
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.520]   They're betting they're going to make money on you.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.680]   You're hoping that your house burns down.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.080]   No, that's wrong.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.400]   But you get what I'm saying.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.160]   The thing is, it isn't a currency.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.040]   At the moment, it's still just a speculation vehicle.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.520]   You know, I mean, it's not like people are actually
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.440]   going out and buying stuff with this,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.880]   with Bitcoin and the rest of it.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.880]   What they're doing is speculating on its,
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.120]   you know, potential rise or fall.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.280]   Well, NFTs particularly seems to be that.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.920]   It's almost as if Bitcoin grows,
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.680]   who thought, how can we get people to give us money
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.160]   for our Bitcoin?
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.200]   And they said, NFTs.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.240]   Again, there's going to be some value down the road.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.880]   It's not a bad idea to have provenance stored
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.120]   in a decentralized, immutable database called Blockchain.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.560]   We were talking on the tech guy today with Samable Samad,
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.480]   who told me that Alpha Romeo has announced
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.360]   that their new vehicle will have its repair history stored
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.240]   in Blockchain as an NFT, which is on the face of it sounds
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.160]   like, oh, that's great.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.920]   So you will be able to, if you're looking at a car,
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.640]   be able to get without, you know, because it's Blockchain,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.840]   so it's nobody controls it, be able to see
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.000]   what the repair history.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.680]   But then Sam added one little tiny piece,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.840]   which is only Alpha Romeo dealers will be able to write
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.000]   to the Blockchain, of course.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.640]   So it really is, and this is a perfect example of a good idea
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.160]   that ends up being a lock-in for dealers doing your repair.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.880]   I will say about cryptocurrencies to Andy's point,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.560]   education, that's the part of the process we're in right now.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.520]   And that makes a lot of sense, 'cause it's early.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.280]   As soon as the government starts talking
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.720]   about creating a virtual dollar,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.520]   which the Fed has been, and the EU,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.520]   they're talking about a crypto-jouro version.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.600]   I think those are all like, you know,
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.640]   they're not a 2022 thing,
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.200]   they're gonna start talking more seriously,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.080]   you think in 2023, beyond they know
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.080]   that virtual form of our currency will be part of the future.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.120]   And I think that's when more people will start to understand,
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.640]   especially if you're gonna get paid
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.240]   in virtual dollars or virtual.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.680]   - Well, we, in a way we are, I mean, my paycheck,
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.640]   I never see a dollar bill,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.520]   my paycheck is just bits that get transferred
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.480]   to some place where I store my bits,
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.320]   and then I give my bits to somebody else
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.320]   when I buy something, there's really no currency involved.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.880]   The only difference between that and Blockchain
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.600]   is that Blockchain has a decentralized ledger,
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.080]   as opposed to my bank having my ledger
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.000]   and that kind of thing.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.080]   And so-- - Well, we're almost there, right?
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.400]   I mean, how often do you use cash these days?
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.120]   - Well, in addition, of course,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.480]   the other necessary difference between is that a dollar
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.760]   is backed by a federal government and treasury
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.840]   that's gonna control inflation and make sure
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.360]   that the value of a dollar doesn't go so wildly,
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.480]   that it really disrupts your ability to use it.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.640]   But this, I hope that Bitcoin and other digital currencies
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.520]   doesn't become just associated with,
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.160]   it's not a digital beanie baby, it's a fad
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.880]   that got blown out very, very quickly
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.600]   by people who are just speculating
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.200]   and turning something silly.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.040]   'Cause it's a very, very powerful concept.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.240]   There are so many people, even in the United States,
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.760]   who simply don't have access to banking period,
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.200]   and the ability to have some of the power
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.280]   of what you're just talking about,
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.840]   about having the ability to move money
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.440]   from one place to another quickly and instantly,
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.440]   without a whole lot of transfer fees,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.360]   without a whole lot of having to sign documents
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.480]   and prove to somebody that you have a legal authority
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.560]   to be inside this country and to have a job,
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.600]   it will allow these people to get jobs, get paid,
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.880]   pay their rent, pay utility bills,
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   pay things like that, without having to live on the fringes.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.160]   And that's a lot of where a lot of the exploitation
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.800]   and abuse happens when you have people who are forced
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.200]   for whatever circumstance from another
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.280]   to live on the fringes.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.920]   So it's, as Connie said, it's early days.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.480]   Hopefully these growing pains will shrug them off
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.440]   and it'll be, it'll realize some of its potential
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.840]   to really help humanity.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.400]   - Yeah, I'll sharpen the attacks from the Bitcoin bros
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.640]   'cause I'll get 'em.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.920]   I am not against the technology.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.120]   I think there's a lot of future in it.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.000]   I agree with you and Connie both.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.680]   We need education and there is at root,
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.120]   something really sensible about this.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.360]   But right now, Wild West makes it a little bit risky
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.680]   and dangerous and it always makes me nervous
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.520]   and see all the advertising, all the hype around it
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.200]   because that's when I go, hey, calm down, calm down.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.280]   This isn't a get rich quick scheme.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.360]   So don't, don't.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.200]   - I think for some people that they're viewing it as is.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.760]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.640]   - A moment apart of Rico, baby.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.040]   Actually, a couple of people who did think
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.760]   it was a get rich scheme, by, well,
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.600]   what they thought was they could rob a Bitcoin exchange
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.560]   and be anonymous, turns out, no.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.560]   The Department of Justice has charged two people,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.240]   Ea, Yolie, Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.640]   - We have to view the video.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.920]   That video is just car crash television.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.760]   (laughing)
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.840]   - As the individuals responsible for attempting
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.840]   to launder 119,754 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.240]   a cryptocurrency exchange in 2016.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.040]   And I think the assumption was,
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.720]   oh, it's on the blockchain, I'm anonymous now.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.760]   But as soon as you try to collect,
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.880]   I think she's, I'm not sure which video you're talking about,
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.080]   the one from RazzleCon, her rap video,
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   has now been made private, unfortunately.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.920]   - Oh, really?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.960]   Oh, damn, that's a pissing.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.520]   - Oh, finally, finally, finally she discovers dignity.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.920]   Wow. (laughing)
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.280]   So, if you will Ian, walk us through.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.760]   So this is the woman, Heather Morgan,
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.040]   who actually has a career as a rapper,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.480]   performance artist and Forbes columnist,
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.440]   which is kind of, they all go together.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.600]   - Oh, well, I mean, I mean,
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.520]   the whole Forbes situation,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.240]   there was a lovely piece out this week
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.000]   where they basically just looked at the history of Forbes
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.160]   over the last 100 years.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.840]   And yeah, there's a huge market
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.000]   in being a Forbes influencer
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.320]   because they'd given up on all editorial standards.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.360]   - Well, you pay to be part of the Forbes contributor network.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.600]   There is legitimate, I think, journalism,
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.480]   coming from Forbes.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.160]   The problem is they're mixed together
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.040]   and you can't tell which is which.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.560]   She, interestingly, published a story on Forbes called,
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.080]   "Expert's Share Tips to Protect Your Business
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.720]   from Cyber Criminals."
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.080]   Can we know of her expertise?
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.840]   We might have read that article.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   Anyway, Ian, what was the, tell me about the video?
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.080]   - Well, I mean, basically this was,
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.360]   it's sort of setting us up as an influence
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.240]   or a rap band, a rapper or whatever else.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.480]   It was possibly the most cringe-worthy thing
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.240]   I've seen all week.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.960]   And that's against having a petition.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.600]   It has to be said.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.720]   But it's a round online.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.560]   She's basically just making bad music for money.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.920]   But I mean, at the point you made
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.160]   in terms of the traceability of blockchain,
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.680]   yes, there are ways to launder, if you like,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.480]   these funds by going through multiple mini transactions,
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.360]   feeding stuff through various different wallets
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.080]   and into a central call.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.720]   But yeah, the arrested show that this is not perfect.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.960]   And so--
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   - DOJ said they obtained private keys
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.120]   to the wallet using search warrants,
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.640]   allowing them to seize more than 94,000
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.960]   of the 119,000 stolen Bitcoins.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.560]   The funny thing is, they're worth a lot more
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.880]   than they were when they were stolen.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.720]   - Oh yeah.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.480]   - At 68 million when they were stolen,
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.200]   they're up to 4.5 billion now in 22.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.320]   - Yeah, there's $600 per Bitcoin at the time of the theft.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.680]   Now it's valued at about 40,000.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.920]   And the really interesting part of this is going to be
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.880]   that the Bitcoin exchange that was robbed
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.480]   claims that within eight months after the theft,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.920]   they'd settled all their debts to their customers.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.880]   Everyone who, they're claiming that when the people
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.760]   who entrusted their Bitcoin to the exchange
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.600]   had their Bitcoin stolen,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.200]   that the exchange had settled their debts with these people.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.000]   And now they are in a blog post on their own servers,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.080]   they're saying that they're looking to recover
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.040]   that Bitcoin from the government.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.240]   And meanwhile, individual people who are customers saying,
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.160]   hey, look, I didn't agree to anything.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.320]   I want my Bitcoin back,
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.160]   especially now that it's worth a double digit multiple
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.200]   of what it was when I put it inside that wallet.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.920]   And the government so far has said that we're looking
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.720]   into how we're going to restore that Bitcoin
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.160]   to whoever it is, who has a legal claim to it.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.680]   There's speculation that they're simply going to auction it.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.240]   Believe it or not, the government sees this Bitcoin
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.680]   just like they see boats, paintings, anything.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.960]   And just like they dispose of seized property,
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.280]   they will, they do auction off digital currencies like that.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.200]   - That's bizarre.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.800]   That shows you the interesting-- - It's gonna be a big fight.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.880]   - Bitcoin in dollars, you wouldn't auction off dollars,
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.320]   they have a value.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.880]   How can you get, I'll pay $10,000 for that $5,000 pile of money?
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.400]   No, but Bitcoin is, the value is so all over the place.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.440]   Maybe it is worth more than today tomorrow, or maybe not.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.760]   And that's here, I found some of the video, Ian.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.360]   - Ah. - You're in luck.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.160]   From Jack Wager-- - Actually, no, I've seen it.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.520]   I'm not in luck, it's really, really bad.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.320]   - All right, okay, it's only 30 seconds, kids.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.920]   Jack's tweet is, I don't know much about crypto security,
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.560]   but this person should not have been able to steal $4.5 billion
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.240]   of it, and I should hasten, as a good journalist,
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.560]   I'm sure Connie would tell me, to say allegedly,
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.240]   allegedly steal 4.5 billion dollars.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.080]   Here we go.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.440]   - Turkish Martha Stark, keep going up in her purse,
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.040]   been dropping with his purse.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.240]   - Don't do that with your pelvis, please, Lee.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.080]   - (laughs)
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.440]   - (indistinct)
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.840]   - I don't know what the sound effect is.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.680]   - (indistinct)
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   - (indistinct)
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   (laughs)
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.560]   - Like I say, I'm getting flea bad.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.160]   - This is, I would be better at rap than her.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.320]   This is awful.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.440]   What I love about this is that I'm sure that in block,
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.200]   if you went to Blockbuster Video in 1997,
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.440]   you could also see like white women instructing you
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.040]   how to do hip hop dance, and exactly those same moves.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.120]   Oh, dear.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.640]   - Or white men, yes.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.480]   - Yeah, or white men.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.320]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.160]   - Or white men, yeah.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.520]   Now you have to go to TikTok for that kind of thing.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.320]   - I do love one of the comments in the IRC,
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   Rebecca Black produced it.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   - Oh yeah.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.800]   There's a name from a blast of the past.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.480]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.800]   This might be a somewhat shorter show
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   because Connie really wants to see Scarlett Johansson
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.760]   and her husband flogging Amazon's Echo.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.600]   You know, it's a shame.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.840]   They've ruined that commercial
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   'cause they've leaked out bits and pieces of it.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.240]   There's no surprise in that one,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.360]   but the premise of it is,
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.240]   what if Amazon's Echo could read your mind?
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.560]   And then Colin, her husband, says things like,
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.840]   yeah, when is the date of that show?
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.960]   And the Echo says,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.920]   send a reminder to fake my death on that date.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.840]   And then more.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.680]   So.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.160]   - That's just brilliant marketing
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.960]   because I think that Amazon knows full well
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.720]   that there's one thing that people trust
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.440]   about the Amazon Echo is that it's not secretly
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.240]   collecting and promoting your mind.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.080]   - It's not reading your mind.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.920]   - That you don't know about.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.760]   - It's definitely not doing that.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   - All right.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.600]   - Yet.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.440]   - Yet.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.280]   - A little break here.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.080]   Maybe they're just pretending they don't know.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.880]   - There could be too, yeah.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.200]   - Our show today brought to you by,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.240]   I don't think Mint Mobile spent $6.5 million
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.520]   on a Super Bowl ad.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.840]   This is just gonna have to do for them.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.120]   The money they save goes right in your pocket.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.440]   Mint Mobile is amazing.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.480]   It's the easiest way to save this year.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.080]   They sell premium wireless service online only.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.840]   They're the first company to do that.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.640]   So no stores, no expensive ads means
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.880]   you maximize your savings.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.880]   Get this.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.760]   Now, just before I say an amount,
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.160]   I just want you to think in your mind,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.360]   a little thought experiment,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.400]   what is your monthly wireless bill right now?
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.840]   10, is it $80?
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.400]   $90?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.240]   I have one with a no name company
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   that's very expensive,
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.800]   that's over a hundred bucks a month.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.280]   Let's do this.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.820]   Same quality, nationwide unlimited talk and text
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.680]   plus high speed data on the nation's largest 5G network,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.800]   $15 a month.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.360]   $15 a month.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.680]   That gets you four gigabytes,
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.160]   which for most people is plenty.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.520]   If you need more, you can get more.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.600]   They have an unlimited plan,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.920]   but honestly, 15 bucks a month, that's all in.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.440]   That's how much the other guys are wasting on Super Bowl ads
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.200]   by going online only,
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.640]   eliminating the traditional cost of retail,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.000]   getting Ryan Reynolds and his four year old daughter
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.120]   to shoot their ads,
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.640]   Mint Mobile passes significant savings on to you.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.800]   And as a Mint Mobile customer, I can verify,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.640]   they are great.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.720]   I'll tell you, 'cause you're geeks you care.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.800]   They are an MVNO for T-Mobile.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.120]   So you're getting T-Mobile's network,
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.200]   which by the way, right now is I think the best 5G network.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.080]   It's amazing.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.680]   You keep your phone if you want,
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.880]   and they'll send you the SIM,
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.520]   and unlike everybody else, they don't charge you for the SIM.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.680]   You could port the number over very easily,
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.200]   or buy a phone from Mint Mobile.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.440]   I bought an iPhone SE for an amazing price,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.800]   really amazing price.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.880]   And when you combine the two together,
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.920]   I'm still only paying 30 bucks a month.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.780]   Brand new phone and great service.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.840]   You choose the amount of data that's right for you.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.340]   Don't pay for data you're not using.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.120]   Starts at 15 bucks a month for premium wireless service.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.160]   You gotta remember the name Mint Mobile.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.680]   Get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.200]   Go to mintmobile.com/twit.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.960]   Sign up today, you get the plan shipped to your door for free.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.600]   I love them so much, I have Mint Mobile socks.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.440]   mintmobile.com, yes, they're Minty Green.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.400]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.420]   You got your wireless build of 15 bucks a month,
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.220]   mintmobile.com/twit.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.380]   I will vouch for these guys.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.140]   It's really great service at a great price.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.260]   I think sometimes you hear that price, you go,
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.620]   that can't be, it is, it really is.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.300]   - Plus you get to have Deadpool as your ISP.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.460]   - I know, not bad, right?
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.420]   Good deal.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:01.300]   Oh, I guess we should talk about the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.900]   and the S Note S8, the new tablet,
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.900]   Samsung announced on Wednesday.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.200]   Little bit of a mess up at the Samsung website.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.240]   You couldn't buy it.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.640]   The pre-orders were open, you'd go through the whole thing,
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.920]   you'd tell them what you're trading in.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.160]   I know, 'cause I did it about 800 times.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.520]   You get, you do the whole thing and you click the button
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.840]   pre-order and it spins and spins and says,
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.880]   "No, sorry."
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.480]   Finally fixed it by the end of the day,
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.560]   but I wonder how many sales they at least got deferred.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.960]   This, Connie, I'm sure you'll be reviewing it,
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.820]   not you personally, but CNET will be reviewing it.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.100]   Soon, in fact, you probably already have a review unit.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.540]   Did you get a chance to play with it at all?
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.260]   - I personally did not, but our team did.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.980]   And what's the takeaway?
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.980]   Cameras, design, references to people who know the Galaxy Note.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.180]   I'll let Andy talk about it,
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.500]   'cause I'm sure he has a more technical take on it.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.140]   Starting price $1,200 and what?
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.300]   They're gonna ship it later this month, right?
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.220]   - February 26th, I will get it in two weeks.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.620]   I'm excited, I think it's a beautiful design.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.260]   These days, you're in an ecosystem.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.860]   And for instance, my wife who wears an Apple watch
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.180]   has an iPhone, has a Macintosh.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.620]   I said, "Do you wanna try the Flip 3?"
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.140]   Because I'm trading it in for the Ultra.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.180]   You wanna try it before I do?
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.540]   And she said, "Can I use my Apple Watch with it?"
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.740]   I said, "No," she said, "Forget it."
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.780]   Andy, you have, it's funny 'cause you're on Mac Break Weekly,
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.900]   we're an iPhone user for years,
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.580]   but you've switched over to Android.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.020]   Are you able to live this mixed marriage?
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.100]   - Yes, there are times where I think,
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.500]   as a Mac user, and an iPad user,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.620]   I'm thinking, "Gosh, it would be nice to have this on my phone.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.540]   It would be nice to have an Apple Watch on my phone,
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.940]   an Apple Watch that actually works with my phone."
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.740]   But yeah, no, it's certainly possible,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.780]   particularly if, as I did before I switched a number of years ago,
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.180]   I was making a concerted effort to not be so reliant
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.060]   on Apple services that aren't transferable to other things.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.820]   I'd switched from Apple Notes, for instance,
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.540]   years earlier to something else,
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.980]   because I was becoming aware and very annoyed of lock-in.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.780]   But yeah, it's not ideal.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.100]   One thing that there's so much that I admire
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.340]   and like about Apple products,
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.820]   one thing I don't like is that they really
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:27.340]   have to be absolutely forced to support any other platform
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.540]   or even make it palatable to use Apple services
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.140]   on other platforms.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.860]   I mean, you would not see an Apple music app on Android,
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.180]   if not for the fact that they are in such a tight fight
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.180]   with Spotify and other services.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.620]   As Lisa Chico pointed out, your colleague at CNET,
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.620]   and you just mentioned kind of, in passing, Connie,
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.500]   this is the note replacement.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.460]   And I was a note fan from day one.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.860]   I loved the big phone.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.820]   Everybody's got big phones now.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.500]   But essentially, even though Samsung
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.100]   hasn't officially said no more note,
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.580]   it's pretty clear the Ultra with its stylus and its styling
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.140]   and its size is their new note.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.860]   And I think it's gonna be a good option
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.340]   for people who like notes.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.460]   - It's a great looking phone.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.260]   And certainly the camera looks really interesting.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.260]   But coming back to your point, as we saw this week,
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.220]   we did a piece about this.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.940]   In Holland, Apple has been forced
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.900]   to allow third-party payment systems
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.580]   on certain dating apps.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.420]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.820]   - And they have made it so incredibly difficult.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.860]   It's not worth doing.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.140]   And we're gonna see the same thing all the way down the thing.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.780]   They hate it when people leave their ecosystem
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.740]   and they will do anything to stop it.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.780]   - Yeah, in fact, developers have,
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.220]   I don't know if we covered this last week.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.140]   I think we did.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:51.140]   Developers are incensed at Apple's insulting offer
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.540]   to the Dutch dating apps.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.500]   We'll take 3% off our 30% commission.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.220]   And that's because you'd argue to use somebody else
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.340]   for the credit card fees,
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.380]   which means you'll pay at least as much as you were paying to us.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.500]   Plus, we're gonna give you all sorts of hoops to jump through
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.300]   in order to get that app on the app store,
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.020]   including a dedicated separate app
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.100]   for the separate payment plan.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.020]   The Dutch regulators decided to continue
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:21.220]   their five million euro a week fine.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.940]   It's my guess, they haven't responded yet,
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.780]   but they're not gonna see this as responsive.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.420]   - Well, I mean, I worked it out, okay?
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.820]   The maximum they can charge Apple is 50 million euros.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:34.420]   And if you look at Apple's 2021 end of year results,
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.780]   that's five hours of profit.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.620]   That's it.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.060]   And this is hardly what you call an incentive.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.100]   - I was gonna say,
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.580]   Apple's, they're the first company to have a $3 trillion
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.980]   market cap that happened in January.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.260]   And they did that off of their closed ecosystem.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.420]   So for people who like tech,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.820]   I'm not gonna say that it's the be all end all,
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.860]   but for people who like tech and want to go through
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:04.060]   some of the pain that is involved in using disparate services
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.340]   and getting different devices to work together,
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.500]   you can build whatever collection of tech you want.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.820]   For people who just want the tech to work for them,
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.460]   Apple is a very appealing alternative,
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.060]   hence $3 trillion market.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.940]   - Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.740]   I just always like to,
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.980]   one of the things that's annoying,
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.500]   the other things that's annoying about Apple is that,
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.620]   boy, they can be so frustrating
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.940]   when they're trying to respond to accusations,
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.060]   legal problems, they're willing to say,
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:42.220]   they put together this image of themselves
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.260]   as this very, very benevolent company.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.980]   It's always for the users who are just doing
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.140]   the making the best products
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:48.700]   and we're trying to change the world.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.820]   And, but if you say that, wow, that's great.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.620]   Wouldn't be great if you supported
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:58.380]   security software on App Stores and countries
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.140]   where your users are kind of under the thumb
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.820]   of a very, very oppressive totalitarian surveillance state.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.780]   They said, oh, well, gosh, what can we possibly do?
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.260]   We have to comply with whatever laws are local
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.900]   in the country which were operating the App Store,
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.340]   but then when you ask them to do something
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.500]   that they don't want to do, which is to simply look,
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   here's a local law, local ruling that says
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.860]   that you need to allow your developers to do this,
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.180]   they say, well, great, we'll write that 50 million dollar
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.460]   check and continue to do exactly what we want to do.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.820]   Do you think that's what they'll do?
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.620]   They'll just thumb their nose and touch regulators
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.580]   and say, here, take your 50 million euros.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.980]   Who cares?
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.660]   That's so arrogant.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.460]   They'll, I do think that that's what they're going to do.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.020]   It also is a problem because the reason they do,
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.380]   they claim that they bow down to the Chinese government
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.780]   all the time is, well, you have to follow local laws.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.140]   Yes.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.700]   I mean, this is what irritates me.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.580]   When you see Apple advertising themselves
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.700]   as a privacy first company, they should have a big asterisk
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.380]   there with offer does not apply in China.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.220]   You know, I mean, they're--
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.180]   But why do they count out of the Chinese, but not the Dutch?
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.180]   Well, because the China is a much bigger market.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.700]   Oh, yeah, market sense.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.540]   Oh, yeah, thank you.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.380]   The market for Netherlands to Apple is minuscule,
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.700]   whereas it's absolutely key that they keep
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.140]   the Chinese market under control.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.180]   I'm not going to rain on people's parade,
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.700]   but let's remember these are all for-profit companies.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.260]   I was trying to think, Andy, when you were talking--
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.100]   and I'm not an Apple apologist by Andy
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.500]   stretch of the imagination, but what
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.020]   is a benevolent tech company?
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.020]   Like who's a benevolent?
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.340]   They're all for profit, right?
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.060]   And they do whatever is expedient.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.340]   Facebook, is that benevolent?
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.460]   Twitter, is that benevolent?
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.460]   Google, benevolent?
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.460]   Microsoft?
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:42.020]   Sat through the Microsoft antitrust trial back in the early
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.740]   days, so I mean, yes, we can all
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.740]   covetch.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:50.260]   They have a PR image that Apple is privacy first,
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.260]   and with a lots of asterisks, not just one for China.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.540]   There are many asterisks there.
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.700]   But I would love to know what is a benevolent tech company.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.260]   And that makes me think this is what I can buy into.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.180]   I agree 100%.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.020]   But the source of my annoyance is that other companies,
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.220]   like Google, like Facebook, they don't try to make--
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.500]   they don't try to identify themselves that way,
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.340]   where as Apple, they got the CNC machine making
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.380]   this beautiful golden halo with a perfectly beveled
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.140]   and chamfered edges and no headphone jack.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.260]   And they strut-- when they put that on,
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.420]   they strut in front of everybody else saying,
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.980]   yeah, so gosh, if only everybody else cared so much,
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.820]   we cry nightly about the problems of privacy.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.420]   Unlike others that seem not to even care.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.340]   It's like, yeah, but again, that's so--
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.660]   Connie, I agree through completely.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.660]   It's like every--
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.660]   I was going to say--
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.660]   I was going to say--
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.020]   --you should be.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.420]   #CourageAndy.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.220]   #CourageAndy.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.260]   Well, that's another irony, because Samsung who's
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.820]   done ads talking about Apple dropping the headphone jack
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.740]   and mocking Apple's notch just ends up
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.180]   doing the same thing eventually anyway.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.660]   So there's--
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.460]   That is an amazing thing.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.500]   There's enough courage to go around.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.540]   I mean, that is-- particularly on the headphone jack,
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.980]   that is intensely annoying.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.780]   I've just upgraded my phone and got one of the last pixels
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.260]   with a headphone jack on.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.980]   But my wife, who's an Apple user, is now living the dongle life.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.460]   And it's not badly.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.700]   I hate it.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.980]   Even Samsung's ginormous--
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:18.500]   What is it?
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.260]   They have the room tablet.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.300]   They have a 14-inch tablet they announced this week.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.900]   And it doesn't have a headphone jack.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.620]   And that is just, what is your excuse?
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.700]   What is your explanation?
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.340]   Usually, oftentimes, the explanation
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.020]   is that, well, there's so little room inside a phone
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.340]   that we don't have room for it.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.180]   Gosh, it interferes with dust and water intrusion.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.580]   OK, fine, maybe.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.820]   But on a tablet with that and the iPad Pro,
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.940]   it's like, you have room.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.500]   People like it.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.300]   Nobody's going swimming with a 14-inch tablet.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.940]   It's a 14-inch tablet.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:50.580]   Let's face it.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.420]   It's obvious.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:55.140]   It's to sell Bluetooth earbuds, which both companies make.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.500]   And both companies make a lot of money on.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.940]   And it's shameful, I think.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.220]   Because Bluetooth will never be as good as wired.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:02.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.380]   It just won't.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.700]   Well, I mean, the amount of software
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.500]   that people stick in their own Bluetooth stacks
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.900]   makes it incredibly difficult to-- even now.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.060]   I mean, we're managing to do remote management
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.020]   on the James Webb's Palace Space Telescope
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.380]   over a million miles away.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.460]   But we can't get our Bluetooth headphones to connect.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.660]   Because it's a software in the stack.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.260]   It's incredibly frustrating.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.340]   Yes, but try to get your iPod's Macs to--
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.660]   your AirPods Master Connect to the Space Telescope,
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.540]   you will have it back at the same time.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.700]   Half the time I'm on a phone call, all of a sudden,
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.620]   the AirPods go to the telescope.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.100]   It's crazy.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.020]   It's crazy.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.300]   Actually, peripherally.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.420]   This is a complete rat hole.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.460]   But I do want to say, wow.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.820]   James Webb is out there.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.220]   It is, yes, almost a million kilometers away.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.780]   We are talking to it.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:55.100]   In fact, it just sent back how many gigabytes of data
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.260]   they're currently tuning it.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.660]   Because they have-- what is it?
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.500]   18 segments on the mirror that they have to adjust
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.660]   to make sure it gets one image.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.740]   So this is what they call the initial alignment mosaic.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.620]   Each of the segments took a picture of one star.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.420]   And now, of course, they're going to have to slowly align
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:22.140]   those segments so that those 18 dots turn into a single dot.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.100]   Let me see if I can find from this NASA story.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.980]   How many gigabytes of data that was?
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.780]   It was a huge amount of data.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.340]   54 gigabytes of raw data that they
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.940]   sent a million kilometers away.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.900]   I guess they're using Mint Mobile because there's
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.820]   no way you're doing that on Verizon.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.740]   Well, I was lucky enough to see it being built at Goddard.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.740]   Really?
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:51.220]   Yeah, I was out at the at an astronomers conference out there.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.660]   It's just the most amazing instrument ever.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.980]   It's also the ultimate piece of space origami.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.500]   The way they've managed to fit that into a single Ariane
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.580]   capsule.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.940]   And then, I mean, the engineers-- because NASA is so still
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.660]   aches at the memory of the Hubble's mistake,
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.420]   so they had to get this absolutely right.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.620]   So they built it.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.260]   Then they put it through a vibration chamber
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.500]   to simulate launch.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.420]   Then they put it through a near vacuum vibration changer.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.740]   Then they spent two months chilling it down using liquid
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.540]   nitrogen to make sure you could still unfold it.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.860]   It's in a marvelous instrument and a triumph of engineering.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.500]   Just hoping it works properly.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.020]   I think that we're getting very--
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.020]   that was the problem is you can test it all you want,
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.220]   a nitrogen box.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.700]   But you don't know what is going to happen
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.860]   when you get into space.
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.460]   And if you're a million kilometers away,
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.940]   there's no repair mission as there was with Hubble
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.060]   to go out and fix it.
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.740]   But I have to say, it got there, it unfolded.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.100]   We're getting images back.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.340]   They are now calibrating.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.980]   And it seems to be going very well.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.860]   We live in really this really interesting era
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.820]   of contradictions where there are people sleeping on the street
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.820]   in San Francisco.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:07.140]   And then we have this amazing technology.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:12.380]   I guess has life always been this way?
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.820]   And I'm just noticing now?
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.740]   Or it seems like the gap between the most amazing thing
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.940]   humans can do.
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.740]   And the worst things humans can do is widening.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.540]   Well, we're seeing it play out every day.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.620]   NASA is an amazing organization.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.300]   I'm a huge admirer.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.140]   And I'm very envious that you got to go see that being built.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:34.540]   Me too.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.660]   But people are questioning science, right?
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.140]   We've been moving through our pans out
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.940]   where science and facts are now something
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.540]   that you can debate and say it's my personal choice,
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.020]   whether to believe in science or not.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.460]   So that's always been the case.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.700]   I just think the stakes are higher.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.140]   And to your point about wealth distribution,
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.380]   all the crypto scammers are taking all the money, right?
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.660]   And it is a very--
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.940]   we're living through an unusual period.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.220]   They're all moving to disuse oil platforms
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.020]   and start and see studying their new country where
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.620]   there's no regulations, no rules.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.100]   All right, back, that was a little detour.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.980]   But a good one.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.820]   I think I'm a great one.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.380]   It's so easy.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.340]   And sometimes I think we talk about the negatives
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.980]   of technology so much.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.540]   I know this was a debate that they recently had at Wired.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.860]   And there was a great editorial where the editor-in-chief--
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.580]   and I'm sure, Connie, you watched it with interest--
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.900]   said, we've gotten kind of negative.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.220]   And we weren't started that way.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.860]   Wired was originally 20 years ago a techno-optimist
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.900]   publication.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:43.260]   We don't want to go in that awfully in either direction.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.660]   And I feel the same way.
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.740]   I'm a tech optimist.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.540]   I'm doing this job for pretty much my entire lifetime
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.380]   because I love technology.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.460]   And I'm excited about the potential.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:59.100]   And I want people to be able to use it for good.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:03.220]   But it's very easy to look at it and go, oh my god, meta.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.740]   We're in deep trouble.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.660]   Well, it's important to remember.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.540]   I'm a tech optimist as well.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.900]   And I wrote for the first issues of Wired.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.300]   I was a contributing editor of my launch.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   Did you?
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.140]   I didn't know that.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.060]   I guess I did know that now that I take a bit.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:16.580]   I did.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.580]   Oh, that's right.
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.900]   And they were--
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.380]   I mean, I think we're all tech optimists.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.820]   Otherwise, we wouldn't be tech reporters.
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.500]   But it's just important to remember
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.660]   that tech is a means to an end.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.620]   It's not the end.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.940]   It's people who are driving how that tech is deployed and used.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:39.340]   And so you have a problem with profit before humanity,
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:44.580]   social media, lots of debates, what's happening there.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.740]   But tech in and of itself is a wonderful thing
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.020]   if it's deployed correctly.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.500]   But it's up to people to set the policy and deploy that.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.540]   So that's what we should be talking about,
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.700]   is who's doing this stuff?
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:44:59.660]   Why are they doing it?
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.100]   Andy's point earlier about cryptocurrencies,
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.980]   the number of people who don't have access to banking
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.580]   in this country or in the world for that matter,
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.060]   it can help solve that problem.
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.900]   But somebody's going to need to want to solve it
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.700]   in a meaningful way and maybe not put
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.380]   profit at the top of the list of priorities
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.180]   and what they're doing.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:21.020]   And that's where it can get a little discouraging.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.900]   Well, we may be at the precipice.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.020]   If you really want to get grim about this,
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.700]   and have to solve these problems.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:33.660]   Like, if we don't solve these problems,
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.740]   we're going to be in trouble.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.300]   My wife is reading John Doar's new book.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.300]   She loves it, Speed and Scale.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.180]   And it's an action plan for solving climate crisis.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.860]   And it really makes a very good point.
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.900]   There's not a lot of time left.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:59.380]   And we seem to lack the political will to do what we have to do.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.220]   And if we wait until it's all tumbling around our ears,
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.300]   it may be too late.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.180]   But I mean, America's in kind of a bubble about this.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.020]   I mean, if you looked at those,
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.860]   Angela Merkel was just resigned in Germany,
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.380]   and they had an election to replace it.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.620]   And the candidate spent 20 minutes per debate
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.340]   talking about climate change.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.500]   Whereas in America, they hardly discussed it at all
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.980]   during the last presidential debates.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.100]   And at least one of the candidates
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.900]   didn't think it was real anyway.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.180]   America is very strange on this front.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.660]   And as a European who's over here,
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.420]   it's kind of disturbing because you're right,
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.580]   we are running out of time rapidly.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.180]   And this needs to get sorted.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.500]   Well, it's also a global problem.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:44.340]   So if America's not on board, if China's not on board,
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.820]   if India and Africa are not on board,
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.740]   it's not going to matter that Germany cares.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.620]   We have to-- and that's another thing.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.420]   We're not very good at global action.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.500]   Well, unfortunately-- sorry.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.060]   Sorry.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.580]   No, just quickly.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.700]   I mean, not to be a downer, but a lot of this problem
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.900]   is a simple problem of lobbying.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.780]   One of the reasons why the James Webb Telescope
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.820]   is where it is right now is because there was no money
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.180]   trying to prevent it from happening.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.620]   There was no profit in trying to stop it from happening.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.620]   There was no political gain in stopping it from happening
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.900]   in a direct sense.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.540]   And that's the sort of thing that can happen,
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.420]   where people can have an argument.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.180]   And at some point, someone will say, you know what?
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:24.860]   You're NASA.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.500]   You know more about this than we do.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.540]   We're giving you appropriations to spend largely as you see fit.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.740]   Go ahead and do it.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:35.660]   Whereas once it becomes very-- once global warming is starting
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.500]   to be seen as a threat against the energy businesses.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.860]   And now they have money in order to convince or coerce
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.660]   lawmakers in the United States to make sure you vote against it.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.620]   Once you also start to make that into a political ledge
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.340]   and to saying that, oh, well, you know what?
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.860]   Those awful people who claim based on theoretical no evidence
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.100]   that the client is doomed is trying to close down these minds.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.340]   They're trying to close down--
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:04.580]   Do you realize how many people get killed because of wind power,
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.140]   kept killed because of solar?
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.340]   And don't worry, we're fighting for your behalf
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.180]   to try to make these insane hippies.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.660]   This is unfortunately-- the best thing for any technology
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.820]   is to be ignored, is to get in under the radar,
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.500]   which is weird because the technology is supposed
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.780]   to be at the service of society, which
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.900]   means that society needs to know about it,
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.340]   and needs to be part of that conversation.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.700]   It's a horrible contradiction.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:29.380]   It's sad, though, that people are using
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:34.300]   to their political advantage using these talking points.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   When it's purely for their own political advantage,
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.500]   it's not looking out for the long-term future of the planet.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.140]   That's terrifying to me.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.780]   And that's a problem we really have to solve.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:47.660]   But back to the Galaxy S8.
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.540]   Back to the gadget phone.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.260]   Actually, I'm interested in--
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.140]   Connie, you have a couple of reviews of the Galaxy tab.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:49:01.380]   This is a giant tablet going straight against Apple's iPad Pro.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.420]   And in fact, Joshua Goldman, writing for CNET,
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.700]   said it should have been a Chromebook.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.780]   With Dex built in, it comes with the keyboard.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.020]   It is, yes, high price.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.780]   But considering that you get the stylus and the keyboard
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.100]   as part of the price right now anyway,
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:20.220]   maybe not so outrageously priced,
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:26.780]   is it finally time for Android tablets to unseat the iPad?
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.340]   Well, I don't know if at that price point, right?
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.900]   That's the reason that iPad--
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.900]   It's a laptop.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:32.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.540]   But it's the convergence of these devices, right?
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.900]   And if nothing else, the pandemic has gotten people
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.980]   using more technology than ever before,
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.220]   and for a lot of people that was their mobile phone,
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.140]   and the screen is small on a mobile phone,
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.980]   unless you have a large format phone,
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.540]   and then you have your laptop, right?
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.740]   Remember people thought desktops were dead,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.100]   and the past two years have been the resurgence of desktops
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.940]   because we've all been locked in our sun's bedrooms, right?
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:00.300]   Yep.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.180]   Using technology.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.980]   Is this your sun's bedroom?
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:03.620]   This is myself--
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.420]   Oh, I thought you were really into the Mandalorian.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.980]   I'm sorry, never mind.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.820]   Well, that's a Star Wars helmet, but someone on my staff
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.780]   has offered and is 3D printing a Mandalorian helmet.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:13.300]   Oh, wow.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.220]   So the next time I come on, I'll have a Mandalorian helmet.
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:15.820]   That would be nice.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.980]   Oh, wow.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.260]   But yeah, it's about the convergence of devices.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.260]   And I mean, we've been talking about this for a long time,
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:29.220]   fablets, or at what point does a tablet replace your laptop?
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.460]   And it's really just a matter of price, right?
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.500]   At some point, to get to a mass market,
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.900]   the capability and the technologies there,
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.300]   iPad has done a really good job, Apple has done a really good job.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.420]   The Android tablets, for better or worse,
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:47.660]   have been considered inexpensive, limited function devices.
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.340]   And so now you're seeing people challenge that,
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.180]   because people are actually wanting to spend the money.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:56.140]   If you're going to go out and carry your laptop around,
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:00.460]   even your lightest laptop is still heavy compared to it.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.940]   I don't know how many they may, but they've sold--
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:06.460]   the ultra, the big one, the 14.6, they've
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:11.100]   sold so many in the US, they've actually stopped pre-orders.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:16.100]   I had to go to Best Buy to see if I could get one from them.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:21.980]   It is a huge super amoled screen, 2960 by 1848,
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.780]   240 dots per inch, 120 Hertz for freight for a fresh rate.
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.540]   And of course, Samsung's known for the displays.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.300]   There couldn't be anybody better to do this.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.980]   And Josh says, got Zoom meetings?
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.740]   This will be your new best friend.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:40.620]   And I guess, based on sales, this is a pent up demand.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.340]   This is something a lot of people want.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:46.020]   It's bigger than some laptops at 14.6 inches.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   And certainly as expensive, $1,200 for the thing itself.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.380]   Once you add in the good keyboard that you would probably
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.100]   need to have in order to justify--
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.180]   Well, they're selling it now right now,
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.620]   included with a keyboard and stylus, which
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.900]   may be why it sold out so fast.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.580]   Probably.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:08.580]   But we're seeing-- it really is kind of shocking how bad
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:10.140]   everybody's right that.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.620]   And Google has not really made any sort of a priority up
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:17.100]   to this point in trying to make Android tablets
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:23.580]   into as productive and useful a device as iPad tablets are.
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.940]   They're really, really good if you want to sell a $60, $70
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.500]   fire tablet, which is extremely useful.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.740]   It's a good, valuable thing.
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.020]   I wonder what put the bug up their nose recently
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:34.940]   to decide that--
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.620]   wow.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.580]   Now that the iPad has been out for almost 10 years,
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.900]   maybe we should look into this.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.540]   And now that they're coming out with Android 12L, which
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:47.380]   is not simply-- whereas before, whenever when Google would
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.140]   announce, here's the new version of Android,
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.820]   they would throw in that, oh, we've
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.180]   added some support for larger screens
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:55.580]   and different screen sizes.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.060]   This is the one in which they're saying, no,
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.740]   here's an actual distinct version of Android
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.180]   that's intended for large screens and also multi screens,
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.460]   like folding screens, stuff like that.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.100]   Given that Samsung is essentially
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.660]   the hardware arm of Android, yes, Google
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.660]   makes their own phones.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.620]   But in the United States of America,
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.580]   there is no market for Android phones.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.620]   There's a market for Samsung phones worldwide, even,
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.820]   although Android is the largest operating system
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.100]   for mobiles anywhere.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.900]   If you took it worldwide market share,
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:27.300]   Samsung has the market share of all--
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.660]   I'm trying to remember from last week when I looked this up.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.460]   If you look at the pie chart, they have the market share
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:37.340]   of the next three plus the remainder after the fourth.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.380]   And so basically, you wonder what kind of meetings
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.700]   have been having that Samsung has been had saying.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.700]   Look, we are a premier display maker.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.660]   We could sell so many more displays
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.300]   if you guys allowed us to make really, really good Android
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.180]   based tablets, what are you going to do
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.420]   to help us to make tablets that are going to justify
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.740]   that kind of price level?
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:59.980]   So maybe we'll see some change in the next year, year and a half.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.820]   But boy, they sat on their hands for so many years
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.500]   that it's hard to imagine someone who
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.700]   coming into a store with $1,000, who
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.460]   doesn't decide to buy a laptop with that money
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:14.420]   to decide to overlook an iPad and simply go with Android.
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:15.940]   Because it's certainly--
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.460]   It's not quite cool.
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.340]   Android tablets have fallen because of its software.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:23.180]   And so interestingly, Samsung's doing a lot of their own software.
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.820]   Yeah, it is weird how Google dropped the ball on this one,
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.300]   because the Nexus tablets, when they came out,
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.940]   were really good tablets.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:34.620]   The Nexus phones were fantastic.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.500]   The latest Pixel things are massively overpriced for what they are.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.100]   But they're still pretty good handsets.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.300]   But I don't understand why Google dropped the ball off.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:42.780]   Who?
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:42.780]   Why?
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.700]   I did the market just--
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.260]   --hamson.
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.820]   Google dropped the ball on dot, dot, dot.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.100]   I mean, that is the story of Google.
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:52.740]   And inexplicably, the story of Google these days.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:57.100]   And we've talked a lot about it on this week in Google.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.940]   We can't figure it out.
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:02.700]   Mike Elgin's contention is just soon to our page is a terrible CEO
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:09.820]   and has wrangled all these individual autonomous teams into a hole.
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:13.180]   And they're competing with each other, much like Microsoft used to do.
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.500]   And they can't stick with anything.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.580]   They're ADD in the extreme.
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.780]   It's very disappointing, frankly.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.740]   Sometimes it comes down to what is the nature?
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:28.020]   What is the story that the company is telling about itself?
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.860]   Google has always been an amazing services company.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.100]   Apple has not done anything really, really great with services.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.500]   But Apple's a hardware company.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.300]   And they can focus, and they can prioritize,
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.860]   and they can target, and manufacture amazingly.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:45.580]   And Google, they're not fundamentally a hardware company,
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.300]   and they're still trying to figure that out.
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.220]   They only just got into the game a few years ago, what?
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.940]   Five years ago when they hired Rick
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:55.460]   Austrolow from Motorola to essentially be their hardware.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.740]   Their hardware is our--
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:01.340]   and famously, and perhaps most embarrassingly,
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:05.500]   for Google hardware, there was that meeting of Google hardware
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:09.020]   a month before the release of the Pixel 4 a couple years ago
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:12.020]   in which the head of hardware basically got the team together
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.460]   about this phone they were about to announce and say, wow,
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.020]   this is a terrible phone.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.620]   I'm really disappointed in all of you, which is like, what are you
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:19.460]   people doing?
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.900]   It's a little late to mention that, Rick.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.300]   I like Rick a lot.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.660]   He does not have a success.
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.380]   His track record is, I'm sorry, since he left Motorola,
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.180]   because he went to Google, has been terrible.
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:35.100]   And that's part of the problem, certainly.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.140]   But ultimately, it falls in Sundar Pichai's court.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.020]   He's got to get this company under you.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.620]   Well, it's motivating and gone into rent-seeking.
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:44.380]   I mean, this is what--
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:45.740]   Well, fine, very frustrating about Google.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.100]   But that's what's kept them alive, right?
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.500]   Is search advertising is--
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:50.500]   Search in YouTube.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.500]   And YouTube.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.940]   And they have so much cash flow from that that they can fail
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.940]   at everything else, and they have.
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.540]   Well, they're doing well with cloud.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.940]   They're still losing money, but they're still
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:02.860]   putting money into it.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.140]   It's a distant third.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:04.640]   They can.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.660]   It's a distant third after Microsoft and Amazon.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:11.980]   But it's a really good place to be in growth.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.980]   When you're charging people just for the access of your servers,
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:16.900]   when you're basically making money every time
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.660]   another service-based company is established,
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.700]   it becomes profitable.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:22.940]   That is a really good place to be.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.940]   There are at least in much better position
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:29.060]   than Facebook/Metta is where Metta has got nothing going on
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.540]   apart from the advertising business.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.500]   And it's a very limited advertising business
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.420]   that they're in.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.860]   So it's an interesting time for Google.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:39.940]   But I think there's room for optimism for Google
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.900]   because they do seem to be realizing
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.940]   that they can still make a lot of--
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.460]   there's still a lot of parts of the world in which they're
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.060]   not making nearly as much money as they possibly could
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.820]   with their most popular products.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.380]   So it's interesting.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.400]   But I would love to see them crack hardware
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.840]   because the Pixel phones--
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.660]   I've never owned any other--
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.200]   excuse me.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.940]   My first Android phone was a Samsung
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.260]   all subsequent phones were Nexus devices or Pixel devices
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.820]   because I really do think they've
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.860]   got a lot of great ideas for hardware.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.540]   And they can definitely take advantage
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:14.040]   of Apple's point of view of if we make the software and the
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.540]   operating system and the developer package,
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.740]   then we can do some exciting things that other companies
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.080]   can't do.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.300]   So I hope that they get their act together on all bases
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.820]   because they are incredible for them.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.280]   I'm absolutely rooting for them.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.400]   I'm just disappointed.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.960]   We should just mention that other people have noticed
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.800]   that Apple has owned the tablet space.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.600]   And Microsoft, to their credit, has done some good stuff
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.400]   with the Surface.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.000]   Excellent point.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.720]   In fact, you could also say this note 8,
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:44.480]   Ultra has kind of aimed at the Surface.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.040]   Same idea.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.400]   In fact, the reason they're using decks on it is because it
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.880]   is sort of a computer.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.880]   Kind of.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.600]   I used the Surface for many years.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.960]   And I did love it in its way, apart from the kickstand
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.440]   at the back, which if you spend a fair amount of time
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.640]   commuting, tracing that in your lap in a battery.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.160]   It's about a lap, yeah.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.240]   But I mean, it was a great laptop.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.960]   It could be an opportunity for Google to do this properly.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.360]   I gave a band in the Chromebook.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.640]   I mean, they made the best Chromebooks.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.400]   They were pricey, but they made the Pixelbook.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.960]   They're out of support, and they don't have a replacement.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:23.600]   I don't get it.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:28.640]   Well, my Pixel Chromebook still works now
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.320]   that I've stuck a new operating system on it.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.400]   But they were building an obsolescence to this.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.160]   I mean, it would die--
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.280]   and it literally died on you after a few years.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.000]   It's frustrating.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.640]   And that's incredibly frustrating for a laptop user.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.240]   I'm going to rain on the plane again as a business reporter.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.360]   Margins on hardware are pretty tight, right?
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.280]   Ask Michael Dell.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.920]   What's the margin on a PC?
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   2% less.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.520]   Apple has something like 30% on the Macs.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.040]   It's--
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.440]   Their margin is amazing, isn't it?
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.280]   Well, because they own that, and they've streamlined the production.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.480]   Tim Cook came from operations.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.080]   It's brilliant.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.880]   My point is Google makes services.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.480]   The margins on services businesses are 60 plus percent, right?
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.840]   So you're going to look at where you're going to invest your money
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.360]   to get the most bang for the buck.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.680]   It's not going to be in hardware unless there's a reason you want
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.240]   to do it to put a stake in the ground.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.960]   And I think the Chromebooks were right to stake in the ground
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.800]   to go after the education market with low margin
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.160]   and see that younger generation and make them all Android friendly,
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.080]   Android aware.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.680]   And I guess they decided in the end they didn't need to do that anymore.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.680]   Apple's profit margin, December 31st, was 28% entire.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.440]   Chris, maybe services brought that up.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.600]   And let's not forget.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.040]   Google writes approximately a billion dollar a month check to Apple,
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.640]   which goes in their services category for Apple continuing
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.240]   to use Google on the iPhone.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.600]   So that's a pretty big chunk of the total services revenue.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.960]   Just comes from another services company.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.760]   Let's take a little break.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.280]   Come back with more Conny Guillaumeo is here.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.400]   She is, of course, EIC at CNET at--
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.880]   --at Tech Leads on the Twitter.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:20.440]   Andy Inaco, who is chief tech correspondent at WGBH Public Radio in Boston,
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.160]   one of my favorite all-time favorite stations.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.680]   That's where I heard Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the first time
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.800]   as I'm WGBH in Boston.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.280]   And from the register, the snark capital of the Western world--
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.200]   probably the Eastern two.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.880]   I don't know what they have in China--
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.680]   Ian Thompson, where he is--
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.680]   Pleasure.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680]   Pleasure.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.760]   Your news editor, is that still your title?
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.880]   I can never remember.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.120]   The US editor at the moment--
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.120]   Nice.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.960]   --we're wicked.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.400]   Honestly, I miss being a reporter.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.000]   It's kind of like-- but it's journalism.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.400]   They kick you upstairs if you get too good at it.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.400]   So--
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.720]   Well, it's the Peter Principle, right?
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.080]   You rise to your level of confidence.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:01.800]   I'm not quite sure.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.440]   The Peter Principle works in this case.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.480]   That was a mean thing to say.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.400]   I was just teasing you.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.080]   You know, you're the best, honestly.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   Our show today brought to you by BetterHelp.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.280]   I know a lot of us have been suffering--
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.560]   mental anguish of one kind or another
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.280]   during the pandemic.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   You know what?
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.200]   I think it's human nature.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.160]   There's a lot of things to deal with.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.400]   But the good news is help is out there.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.040]   And BetterHelp is making it easier and more affordable
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.200]   than ever before.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.240]   BetterHelp-- it's not a crisis line.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.200]   It's not self-help, it's professional counseling
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.000]   from licensed professional therapists
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.200]   done securely online.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.560]   And it is amazing.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.400]   And I can say that from personal experience.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.240]   BetterHelp will assess your needs
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.200]   and match you with your own licensed professional therapist.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.000]   You can connect in a safe and private online environment.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.800]   You can connect the way you want.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.880]   You could do weekly video if you want.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.720]   You could do phone sessions if you don't want the camera on.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.080]   A lot of people like that.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   You can message your counselor any time,
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.160]   and you'll get timely and thoughtful responses.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.200]   So you're really getting help throughout the week.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.040]   It's convenient.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.760]   You can start communicating in under 48 hours.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.080]   I mentioned that because it's not a crisis line.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.480]   So there are crisis lines.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   If you're in crisis right now, please take advantage of that.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:30.160]   But if you want long-term guidance, counseling, coaching,
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.520]   this is a great way to do it without ever sitting
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.480]   in an uncomfortable waiting room in private
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.880]   with great therapists.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.120]   And by the way, one of the things
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.000]   I've always been a big believer in
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.640]   is you've got to find the right therapist for you.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.920]   Everybody's different.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.400]   BetterHelp is committed to facilitating
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.160]   great therapeutic matches so they make it easy
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.280]   and free to change counselors anytime if you need it.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.240]   And that's I think an extremely important point.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.200]   Don't hesitate, in fact, to try a few different counselors
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.280]   so you find somebody who really fits your needs.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.840]   It is more affordable than traditional offline counseling.

[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.080]   Thank you for your support.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.320]   Talking about meta, talking about Facebook,
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:49.920]   they're threatening to shut down Facebook and Instagram
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.320]   in Europe, if those darn regulators,
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.440]   Joe, don't let up, you gotta stop knocking us, man.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.280]   The problem is this privacy shield,
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.400]   the agreement that was initiated
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.400]   between US social media networks
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.680]   and other companies storing data in the US
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.560]   and European regulators.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.360]   The privacy shield was designed to make it so that
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:20.480]   if they are gonna store European data in American servers,
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.080]   they adhere to all the privacy laws of the EU.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:29.320]   The EU has decided apparently that the privacy shield
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   is not working and they're about ready to go to companies
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.800]   like meta and say, look, you gotta start storing your stuff
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.320]   in European servers 'cause you're not adhering
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.680]   to our regulations.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:47.280]   And meta now is filing with the SEC warned,
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.120]   if a new framework is not adopted,
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.960]   if the company can no longer use the privacy shield agreements,
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.160]   they will not be able, probably, this isn't a quote,
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.080]   probably not be able to offer, quote,
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.320]   "its most significant products and services,"
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.800]   that would I presume include Facebook and Instagram and the EU.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.920]   Connie, is this a bluff?
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:15.240]   - I'm laughing because, yeah, it's a bluff,
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.160]   but they can say whatever they want in their company filings,
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.960]   oh, it's hurting us and we might have to pull it.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.120]   And then the rest of the story is that after they said that
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.000]   and put that statement out in their filing,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.920]   I believe it was a regulator in Germany,
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.480]   but it might have been in France who said,
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.320]   yeah, that's good, we don't need it.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.520]   - It was both. - Facebook.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.360]   - It was France and Germany.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.240]   - And then Germany said, yeah, whatever, we don't need it.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.160]   But my life is better without you guys, go away.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:48.160]   So somebody, one of the executives from Facebook,
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.240]   then put out a statement on the company's blog saying,
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.080]   no, it's not our intention to walk away from Europe.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.880]   But we're really concerned about this,
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.400]   it's gonna have a material impact on our business,
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.640]   which Facebook makes a lot of money,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.880]   they're not a non-profit.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.960]   And so it's gonna cost you more to do business
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.440]   in these countries and that's the ultimate call.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.920]   I will say Facebook's growth is not in Europe,
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.560]   it's not in the US either, right?
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.040]   Like I was looking up some stats,
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.400]   90% of Facebook's daily active users come from outside
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:25.080]   the US and Canada and their biggest growth opportunities
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.480]   are in India, Indonesia, Brazil, right?
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.840]   So other markets, so it's not that they don't need Europe,
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.040]   but that's not where the growth is.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.480]   But at the same time, this is a cost of doing business.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.560]   And it's a cost of doing business calculation.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.160]   - It's a little weird that they wouldn't just say,
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.080]   okay, fine, we'll put our data on servers in the EU.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.680]   What are they afraid of?
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.120]   Why wouldn't they do that?
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.040]   - Well, I mean, they can't live with the privacy requirements.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.480]   - I mean, there's a cost aspect,
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.000]   but also Europe has, as you put and pointed out,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.080]   very strong privacy requirements.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.560]   And so they're really saying,
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.760]   we don't wanna protect your privacy, that's too much.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:04.600]   A bridge too far.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.560]   - Well, I mean, kind of the EU has been painted
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.920]   into a corner on this one because they didn't really want
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.760]   to pick a fight with Facebook in the first place,
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.440]   but there's a lovely Austrian bloke called Max Schrem's
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.600]   who took the whole thing to call and pointed out that,
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.560]   yeah, okay, you can't do business like that
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.040]   under existing EU laws.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.840]   So that's kicked the whole thing off.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.040]   - By the way, his name is now lives in infamy, right?
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.480]   'Cause they call it the Schrem's rule.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.440]   - But I mean, Connie has it exactly right.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.360]   Facebook threw that down on the table
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.120]   and the French and German government said,
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.120]   yeah, okay, fair enough, we've draw services.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.840]   We can live with that and call the bluff.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.360]   And now Facebook is backpedaling faster
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.160]   than Olympic Rowa.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.160]   - I love, I'll give you the quotes.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.760]   This was a meeting of economic ministers
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.160]   from Germany and France,
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.880]   German economist, economy minister Robert Heibach
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.120]   told reporters, after being hacked,
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.560]   I've lived without Facebook and Twitter
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.840]   for four years and life has been fantastic.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.560]   And then to which the French Foreign Finance Minister,
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.360]   Bruno Lameiro said, I can confirm
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.800]   life without Facebook is very good.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.480]   (laughs)
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.120]   - I'm sorry, I made him into Peppy LePew.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.720]   I didn't mean to do that.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   - It would have been nice if the French spokesperson
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.720]   has gone poof.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.800]   (laughs)
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.040]   - Digital giants must understand the European continent
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.440]   will resist and affirm its sovereignty.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.840]   I've found in your general direction.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.760]   (laughs)
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.120]   No, he didn't say that part, I added that.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.200]   - It would be nice having Féchier LeVash,
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.280]   but still loose.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.000]   - I think honestly that it's a little bluffing
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.160]   on both sides.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.040]   - Do you think they'll work something out, Connie?
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.440]   - Yes, I do think they'll work something out,
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.040]   but it's gonna be great Asians, right?
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.440]   They'll have some sort of something
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.560]   for a limited period of time and they'll revisit it.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.200]   But I think Anne's point is correct.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.320]   The European Union has been extremely forward thinking
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.320]   and very aggressive in privacy protections.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.960]   Facebook does not want those protections
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.960]   to have to adhere to them.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.760]   It would not allow them to exploit user data
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.280]   the way they have been because they make a lot
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280]   of their money from ads.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.120]   90 plus percent of Facebook's money comes from ads.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.200]   Not all ads are created equal.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.880]   Targeted ads, ads that know something about you
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.360]   and that are being fed to you based on preferences
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   are the most valuable in the hierarchy of ads.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.840]   So they go to Capitol Hill, by the way,
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.600]   along with the other tech companies and say,
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.240]   "Well, we're willing to accept some regulation
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.480]   "because privacy is important,
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.280]   "but I haven't ever seen any proposals
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.960]   "for what kind of regulation they are actually willing to accept."
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.440]   So this is a dance.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.000]   So they have started their dance
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.720]   and it's going to work its way through.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.280]   - I think there's also a lot of testing,
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.280]   fingers to the wind, because obviously EU politicians
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.320]   don't wanna do anything that their consistency will hate.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.400]   So if, and I'm sure Facebook's saying,
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.200]   "Well, watch this."
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.680]   And we pull, I don't know, Facebook's the big deal.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.480]   I think maybe WhatsApp is a bigger deal
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.720]   in some of these countries.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.240]   But if we pull our products out of your country,
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.240]   you're gonna be thrown out of office.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.560]   And I think the politicians are also saying,
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.080]   well, is that the case?
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.800]   How dependent are people on this?
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.800]   And aren't, I think, increasingly consumers
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.480]   are aware of the privacy issues
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.000]   and maybe are less than happy
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.440]   about how much data Facebook collects.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.160]   So I think everybody's kind of jockeling,
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   jockeying a little bit to see,
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.200]   well, how is this gonna affect us in the long run?
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.840]   - Yeah, it's a little like prohibition.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.400]   You can get enough ground support to say,
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.560]   yes, we should definitely do this.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.400]   We were with you, we were on your side,
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.480]   government regulators.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.920]   But then once you take away this from everybody,
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.840]   that's when you start dealing with the problem of,
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.960]   is this really a populist support action?
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.200]   Or is this something that you probably should have
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.600]   negotiated out better?
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.120]   It really is a, it really is a,
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.920]   this plus things like the rulings that Google
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.440]   has been suffering recently,
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.760]   that Google Analytics is now violates GDPR,
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.760]   the use of Google fonts violates GDPR.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.120]   That's crazy.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.200]   - That's crazy.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.040]   Isn't it?
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.400]   - Well, it's, if GDPR,
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.440]   this is the test of GDPR.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.280]   Is it good?
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.520]   Is it necessary?
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.360]   Is it right?
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.680]   And is it flexible?
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.720]   If it is all of those four things,
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.240]   then all of these international companies,
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.560]   excuse me, are international.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.600]   Mostly the huge titans that are based in the United States.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.080]   They've been, and I'm including Apple here,
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.640]   they've all been used to the idea of,
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.280]   we can do whatever we want.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.040]   And our products are so popular and beloved worldwide
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.280]   that your government,
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.200]   your people are just gonna have to deal with it.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.880]   They're not, this old fashioned way of,
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.040]   we're gonna have Apple and Google and Facebook
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.720]   having essentially one international policy
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.000]   and making little trims and adjustments
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.280]   for local legislations is not gonna work anymore.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.360]   You're gonna have to have, essentially,
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.320]   a Facebook for each individual
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.920]   political, geopolitical unit,
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.360]   because each one is gonna want to have their own regulations,
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.160]   their own protections for privacy.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.280]   And they can fight it,
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.640]   but that's gonna buy them some time
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.560]   until they're forced to acknowledge
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.480]   that we can't just simply pull out of every country
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.600]   that doesn't allow us to do exactly what we wanna do
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.760]   and how we wanna do it.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.160]   And that's what I think we're gonna do.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.880]   I think we're also gonna see a lot more pressure
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.560]   on the Department of Commerce
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.720]   on American tech companies to look,
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.600]   fix the privacy shield,
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.520]   find a way to negotiate internationally
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.480]   so that whatever it is that was made this okay
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.000]   for most people in 2016,
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.960]   but failed in 2020 can be renewed and re-nabled for 2022
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.280]   because it is much easier for American industry
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.720]   to be able to simply comply with one set of regulations
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.720]   imposed by a diplomatically agreed federal standard
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.360]   than to simply come up with a brand new product
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.720]   for every sphere in which they want to operate.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.280]   They don't wanna do that.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.280]   And then there's the UK.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.960]   (laughing)
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.360]   - Oh great, yeah, jump on the breath.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.520]   (laughing)
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.720]   - I remember when this was first floated back in 2017
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.200]   that if you wanted to
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.520]   watch porno in the UK,
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.960]   that you'd have to go to a pub
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.600]   and verify your age
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.400]   so that that could be put on record
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.920]   so you'd be allowed to do it.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:34.560]   - Yes, okay.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.360]   So first off, I would like to say
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.840]   this isn't about just pornography.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.400]   I know the reds gets a reputation for being somewhat smussy,
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.920]   but gas actually really nailed this.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.000]   This is about age verification for a whole bunch of services
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.880]   including social media.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.000]   And as is the style with the British government these days
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.760]   and these Brexit island moments,
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.960]   they're not gonna do it themselves.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.200]   They're going to hand it off to a third party supplier.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:05.320]   So all that age verification and credit card details
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.240]   are going to the lowest bidder
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.400]   who is going to run the service for the government.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.960]   - Oh, that is, what a nightmare.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.520]   - Exactly, I mean, you're not only creating
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.320]   a large database of really valuable information.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.760]   You're linking its pornography
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.920]   which means that the
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.680]   sort of the kind of criminals who will go after people
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.720]   on blackmail grounds will also say,
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.760]   oh, this has showed up,
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   you are accessing this stuff.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.880]   So that's another attack factor being used.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   It is a disaster in the making.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.480]   Unfortunately, disasters in the making
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.520]   of what Britain was becoming quite known for
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.360]   for some time.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.960]   - Number one export it seems.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.040]   Besides, Stilton, Gee, see.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.400]   - TKs of course.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.040]   - TK and Marmite.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.740]   - Marmite, well you say, so you say,
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.200]   yeah, just the specter of an 18 year old
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.280]   walking into a bar to verify his age.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.560]   It's a little disconcerting.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.200]   Do you think this is going to happen?
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.680]   - They've been talking about it for many years now.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.400]   I mean, I think this plan was first mooted
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.040]   about three years ago.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.200]   And it got shot down fairly quickly
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.560]   because you had people in, you know--
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.400]   - Oh, we mocked it.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.400]   I remember. - Yeah.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.040]   - Yeah. - Yes, exactly.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.760]   However, this is Britain
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.240]   we're talking about at the moment.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.280]   And the ability for my country
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.360]   to cut its own throat has been tested
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.800]   and found wanting many, many times over the last few years.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.760]   So I think it may well go through
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.040]   and they'll put it down as,
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.720]   oh, this is an anti-pornography measure,
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.080]   but it's a disaster waiting to happen.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.160]   And it's going to happen, it seems.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.480]   I mean, the current government is,
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.920]   well, okay, if you've been following British politics,
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.880]   the current government is in a bit of a pickle to say the least.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.880]   And I think they're going to let this one go through
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.280]   because enough conservative MPs seem to think
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.560]   it's a good idea because they don't really understand
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.720]   the technology on it.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.320]   - A disaster in the making that almost happened in the US,
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.680]   the IRS was going to use a third party,
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.680]   ID.me to collect face recognition information
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.800]   to verify yourself on the IRS sites
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.000]   after a lot of criticism
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.840]   and saber rattling from people like us included,
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.760]   the IRS has backed down, but what is unknown is,
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.560]   they already ID.me already collected seven million
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.840]   facial records from people who signed up through the IRS
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.600]   and it's unknown what's going to happen.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.440]   Ron Wyden who wrote the letter that finally convinced the IRS
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:45.720]   maybe Senator Wyden, of course,
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.200]   pretty smart about, pretty savvy about technology
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.400]   forced the IRS to say,
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.680]   okay, maybe we shouldn't be collecting
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.760]   face recognition information just to prevent fraud.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:59.120]   I'd be very curious, the chair now,
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.560]   the House Oversight Committee wants to know
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.680]   whether the agency will tell ID.me to erase,
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.200]   erase what you have already.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.560]   We don't know yet.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.160]   So there's good news, they're going to drop
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.800]   that face recognition requirement.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.680]   Although 30 other states and Ted Federal agencies
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.200]   still use it, I know what will happen to the existing data.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.000]   - I mean, it comes back to what you were saying before
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.720]   in that a lot of people don't have the technology
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.120]   to make this work.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.600]   There is a large number of people in the US, for example,
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.840]   who don't have a decent laptop,
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.760]   who don't have a phone that could work with this.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.160]   And just giving all that data to a third party,
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.520]   particularly if it's something like tax was just insane.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.840]   It's the same problem that we have with the UK
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.600]   and their age verification problems.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.800]   They all two sides of the same coin.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.000]   - Yeah.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.600]   Take a little break, come back with more
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.280]   with our esteemed panel, great bunch.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.480]   We're trying to, I don't want to say rush
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.560]   through the tech news.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.800]   But Connie wants to see the commercials on the Super Bowl.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.560]   And I kind of do too.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.080]   - So use me as your assistant.
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.800]   - I want to see Mary J. Blige in the halftime show.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.640]   So that's what we're sure.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.680]   - We all do because collectively we have a responsibility.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.480]   A lot of people work very, very hard on these commercials.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.320]   - Exactly.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.040]   - Which would just take the Mickey right out
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.880]   of the McDonald's rock, do you mind think?
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.480]   - Oh, oh, oh, Dwayne Johnson is now on the field.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:26.080]   I don't understand why the rock gets so much attention,
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.520]   but apparently he's beginning the football game
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.600]   with some sort of huge screen.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.920]   (laughs)
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.480]   - So that is a good tactical choice
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.280]   because he can clear the field just with his charisma.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.800]   - Yeah, that's it.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.640]   (laughs)
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:43.920]   - Charisma clearing.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.200]   - I get very lucky because our local pub doesn't show it.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.840]   They don't have a TV in so it's--
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.080]   - Oh, isn't that nice?
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.520]   - It's very quiet in there.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.000]   - Well, yes, but there's honestly a pub shouldn't have a TV
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.240]   in it because it automatically draws the eye.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.480]   - Yeah, nobody tells us.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.920]   - Yeah, I agree 100%.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:04.160]   Somebody was selling for years a remote control
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.280]   that you could carry into a bar
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.280]   and turn off all the TVs.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.200]   - Well, do you remember someone using that at CES?
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.560]   A couple of people got thrown out
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.600]   because they'd gone around the displays
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.440]   and just like--
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.600]   - It's keeping your pocket, guys.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.160]   I guess that's in a way kind of my motto for life.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.480]   Our show today brought to you by worldwide technology
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.760]   and Intel, WWT.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:27.800]   We love these guys.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.920]   Went out, that was our last visit.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.800]   Right before pandemic began, we,
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.120]   Lisa and I flew out to St. Louis
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.080]   to visit WWT's World Headquarters
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.320]   and their amazing advanced technology center.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.200]   This is an incredible thing.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:47.040]   Those of us who've been in the tech business for a while
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:51.640]   remember the big PC magazine and the labs that they had
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.240]   and all these independent labs
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.080]   are kind of gone by the wayside.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.640]   Thank goodness, WWT has now invested,
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.120]   and they have half a billion dollars
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.360]   worth of OEM technologies in their ATC.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.920]   A huge amount of equipment.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.240]   It's spread from one building to two to three to four.
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.160]   I think there's five or six now.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.760]   And what's great about these labs?
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.960]   Of course, the engineers at WWT use it
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.720]   to spin up proofs of concept,
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.520]   to integrate hardware and software
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.200]   to help their customers who are bringing technology
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.600]   into their enterprises.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.400]   But what's great about this is you can use it too.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.640]   The advanced technology center offers hundreds
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:31.360]   of on-demand, schedulable labs
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.400]   that you can use yourself to try out these technologies
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.480]   before you buy.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.320]   Featuring solutions that include technologies
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.560]   like Intel's Xeon scalable processors,
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.560]   Intel's Optane Persistent Memory and Optane SSDs.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.240]   There are labs representing all the newest advances
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.360]   in everything like multi-cloud architecture,
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:55.000]   security, networking, primary and secondary storage,
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.400]   data analytics and AI dev ops,
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.960]   everything you need to know
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.360]   when you're incorporating technology into your business.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.600]   Now the engineers have used this for years,
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.360]   but now partners can use the ATC,
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.360]   spin up their own proofs of concepts, their own pilots,
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.600]   select the best solutions.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.960]   And it's more than just these labs,
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:17.280]   there's technical articles, white papers,
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.600]   expert insights, demonstration videos,
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.760]   there's hands-on labs, there's all sorts of tools
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:25.400]   to keep you up to date with the latest technology.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.760]   With the advanced technology center from WWT and Intel,
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.120]   you can test out products and solutions
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.920]   before you go to market.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.520]   It's not only a physical lab space,
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.600]   it's a virtual space that you can use any time of the day
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.360]   or night anywhere in the world.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.320]   And guess what?
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:45.320]   It's free to become a member of the ATC platform.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.120]   And while you're there,
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.080]   you wanna also check out the events and communities,
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.120]   they do some great stuff,
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.160]   they bring in lots of smart,
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.920]   we've done a panel there, it was really fantastic.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.400]   A place you can learn about technology trends here,
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.520]   the latest research and insights,
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.320]   whatever your business need,
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.400]   whatever business you're in,
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   WWT can deliver scalable, tried and tested tailored solutions,
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.240]   solutions for use specifically,
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.640]   because they understand business,
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.000]   they know that whatever technology you use
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.600]   has to support your business strategy.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.960]   That's what WWT does,
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.240]   they bring strategy and execution together
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.000]   to make this amazing new world happen.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.560]   Learn more about WWT, the ATC to gain access
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.120]   to all these free resources, it's very simple.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.200]   Go to www.com/twit,
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.200]   make sure you go to the slash twit part.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.680]   So they know you saw it here,
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.560]   that helps us a lot,
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:43.560]   WWT.com/twit, creating a count on their ATC platform
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.440]   and get learning,
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.440]   www.com/twit, love these guys.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.400]   And boy, if you're in business and you're using technology,
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.480]   you will love them as well.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.360]   Word of warning from bleeping computer,
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.560]   this was inevitable.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.800]   Microsoft has turned on
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.960]   and I've heard a lot of annoyance about it.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.720]   The ad for Windows 11,
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.840]   if you're still running Windows 10,
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.920]   you're gonna get a pop up saying,
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.720]   hey, you could get a Windows 11,
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.640]   sometimes even if you can't, by the way.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:23.280]   Now there are bad guys out there,
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.520]   we call them threat actors
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.560]   and I'm not talking Sylvester Sloan here,
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.120]   these are bad guys who started distributing
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.200]   pop ups that look like their Microsoft pop up saying,
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.000]   hey, it's here, you can install it, Windows 11,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.760]   except when you click the link,
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.840]   it doesn't take you to a Microsoft site,
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.440]   it takes you to a site that looks just like Microsoft,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.320]   it used to be windows-upgraded.com.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.600]   They obviously have shut,
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.200]   the good guys have shut that down,
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.800]   but there will be other sites.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.880]   Can you tell the difference if you're a normal user
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.240]   from this in a Microsoft site?
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.920]   No, but if you click that button that says download now,
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.520]   you're not gonna get Windows 11,
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.960]   you're gonna get something called the Redline Stealer,
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.280]   which as you might have guessed, that's malware.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.440]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.320]   - Actually, I thought it was gonna be the name
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.200]   for the new Washington,
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.240]   the new name for the Washington football team, but no,
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.160]   it's not, it's...
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.480]   - Which would've been good name, right?
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.640]   The Redline Steelers, but no.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.040]   - If Can, I could have two
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.760]   to two football teams named Roughriders,
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:29.800]   we can have-- - There you go.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:30.640]   - Name Steelers,
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.520]   these are the Redline Steelers.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.400]   Anyway, I have to think people are falling
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.240]   for this right and left,
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.040]   'cause it looks in every respect like a real thing.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.200]   So just a word of warning, tell your family and friends,
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.840]   people who don't, anybody who listens to any of our shows
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.920]   is too sophisticated to fall for that, I think.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.520]   - You'd say, I mean, I have to say though,
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.800]   I mean, with Microsoft,
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.760]   Windows, they learned from the Windows 10 experience,
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.480]   and that even Nagy though it is,
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.880]   it's less Nagy than it was when Windows 10 came out
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.560]   and they were trying to get everyone to upgrade,
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.960]   and they're not forcing stuff out on everyone,
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.480]   but yeah, I mean, looking at the screenshots
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.680]   of what they're putting out, it's very convincing stuff,
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:14.000]   and I'm warning people,
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   warning my parents, just be careful
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.520]   in this one, just leave it alone.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.360]   - Yeah.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.680]   Yeah, exactly, I mean, that's who you have to
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.120]   talk to as normal people.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.600]   I'm kind of an outlier here,
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.480]   I'm of the opinion no normal person should be using Windows.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:36.040]   Honestly, if you're not willing to be a security expert,
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.120]   if you're not strongly motivated because,
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.640]   I don't know what you need it for work,
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.640]   or you're a gamer, and you're not willing to really,
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.040]   kind of keep your eye out for stuff like this,
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.680]   you should be using a Chromebook,
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.760]   or you shouldn't be using Windows,
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.360]   it's too risky.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.560]   Am I, is that, I know that's annoying when I say that.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.760]   - The problem is that a Chromebook or an iPad
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:05.760]   is a wonderful substitute for a desktop operating system
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.840]   until it isn't, and then you're really, really hosed.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.880]   When you've got, when you, when the only way you can,
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.680]   you can register for, for COVID testing,
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.600]   they're assuming that you've got an actual
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.400]   like desktop grade browser and desktop grade operating system,
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:22.920]   that's a problem.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.840]   iPad's more of a problem than Chromebooks,
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.720]   but again, it's a great solution until it actually,
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.480]   isn't there getting better, but it's still a problem.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.840]   - Okay, I guess my philosophy is if,
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.600]   I tell people, okay, don't buy Windows,
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.260]   but if you do, don't call me.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:42.360]   - Yeah, they're still, there's still gonna be
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.200]   a lot of problems.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.040]   - They're still gonna call you, aren't they?
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.320]   - Yes.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.120]   - Yeah, I mean, it's not, it's not as,
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.920]   it's not as pure as it once was.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.460]   I used to make the exact same thing,
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:52.360]   I would say I'll, I'll great, if you're looking
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.840]   for a laptop, I'll help you.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.920]   If you buy, I used to be, I'll give you like three,
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.560]   oh, three service calls on Windows, unlimited on Mac.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.960]   And I started, I stopped joking about that because,
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.360]   not because I was not willing to help people,
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.000]   friends and family, but because I thought in modern times,
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   it gives people an, maybe inaccurate picture of how,
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.200]   of how much stable and how much more secure and safe a Mac
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.040]   is, it used to be that, wow, there just is no malware
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:21.880]   out there for the Mac.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.760]   Oh, wow, there's just almost no, there really is nothing
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.600]   to think about.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.600]   So you can't be curious.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.360]   - I think general purpose operating systems,
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:29.640]   which of course have their place,
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.400]   that's how computing began, but their general purpose,
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.920]   they're designed to let you do what you wanna do.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.680]   And that is inherently risky.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.120]   And I don't think most people need more than a Chromebook.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.040]   I mean, yes, you're right.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.520]   If you suddenly say, oh, I've decided I'm gonna create
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.960]   the next Oscar winning film, you might need something
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.320]   more than a Chromebook, but most people just browse
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.840]   the web and do email and buy things on, you know,
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.440]   overstock.com.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.200]   I mean, I don't think they need windows.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.360]   And if that's all you do, you shouldn't, you shouldn't.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.520]   But I know, I know, go ahead, everybody yells at me.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.320]   - Yeah, you have to remember that companies dictate
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.080]   what computer systems you use at work.
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.160]   And a lot of professions still usually run
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.280]   on one dedicated app.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:17.120]   And a lot of those are written for Windows.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:17.960]   - No, and I create it.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:18.960]   - Especially in the medical community.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.840]   - But in that case, you probably have an IT department.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.720]   If you don't have an IT department, you are the IT department.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.280]   - Yes, but that doesn't mean it makes it easier
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.920]   if your windows is compromised or you haven't updated
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.040]   that month's security update.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.040]   And there's an exploit, there's still pain involved.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.840]   - There's pain, there's pain.
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:42.640]   There's pain, if you listen to KUOW in Seattle
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.320]   and you're driving a 2016 Mazda, there's pain in life.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.800]   Life is full of pain.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.520]   This is kind of a hysterical problem.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.760]   Mazda's entertainment system apparently
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.480]   is not sanitizing its inputs.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:02.480]   And Mazda's from 2014 to 2017 have this problem
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:05.560]   discovered by Mazda owners in Seattle
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.360]   who are forced, forced I tell you
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.360]   to listen to the local NPR station.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:16.040]   They tuned it in and in this case,
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.600]   the station was sending, you know,
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.520]   there now is this new system
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.720]   where a station could send additional information
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:25.160]   over the airwaves like album art
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.120]   or song titles and stuff.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:30.640]   And most radios now will display the song title.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:34.320]   Well, apparently Mazda was written in such a way
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:36.080]   that when the image files came in
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.480]   and they didn't have extensions,
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:40.400]   it bricked the infotainment system
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.280]   and you're stuck on KUOW.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.760]   This is not new though.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.840]   Apparently there's a podcast,
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:50.200]   99% invisible podcast
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.320]   that had the same problem
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.680]   because they have a percent sign in their name.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.080]   And it was also breaking Mazda's.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.600]   (laughs)
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:02.320]   So they made a Mazda safe feed
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:07.320]   for their podcast that was 99 P-E-R-C-E-N-T instead.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.880]   So this is not a new problem.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.480]   It's not an unknown problem.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:14.360]   The question is who's gonna fix those Mazda's
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.440]   because they're out of warranty.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.960]   Okay, we love the story
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:24.600]   'cause it gave us a great subhead video
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.800]   killed the radio staff.
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:26.640]   (laughs)
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:27.480]   It broke your car.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.560]   (laughs)
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.880]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.840]   The register is a gift that just keeps on giving out.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.520]   - But I mean, it does seem at this point,
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.920]   like it's going to be almost impossible to fix.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.640]   They're gonna have to order a new components
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.000]   with a supply chain issues.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.880]   That's gonna be a massive delay
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.480]   if they can actually get the components themselves.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.840]   So it's just one of those embedded tech problems
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.640]   which is the bevelment of the industry.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.480]   - Yeah.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.320]   - Yeah.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:58.120]   - It's also another sort of timely story
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.240]   that here in the United States,
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.920]   the 3G cellular networks towers are being shut down,
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.680]   starting with AT&T on the 22nd of this month.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.520]   - Oh yeah, get ready.
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.280]   - Which is 202.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:11.280]   - Which is not a problem for users with phones,
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:14.960]   but the thing is most of the digital connections
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.800]   to the network that are happening through cars
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.360]   are through cheap 3G modems.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.640]   And if the solution to this problem would be,
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.960]   oh, well, no problem, we'll just push out a software update.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.800]   Well, guess what?
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.360]   That 3G tower you're gonna need.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:28.400]   You're gonna have to drive somewhere
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.480]   where there is still a 3G tower
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.640]   in order to have your car automatically connected at server
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.240]   or take the car into a service center
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:39.360]   just to have them apply a software patch.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.000]   And given how much more complex,
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.600]   not just the entertainment console software is,
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.200]   but also just the software that keeps an engine running
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.880]   and keeps an engine tuned properly
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:52.920]   is how many more billions of lines of code
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.280]   are being into this sort of stuff.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.680]   This could start to be a problem.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.280]   Things that used to work automatically
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.600]   and the user just didn't understand that,
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.200]   hey, overnight while you were parked,
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.520]   you received a very, very critical software update.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:09.000]   Now your car is dead and your service center will say,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.520]   "Oh, well, we'll cost you $300 for a new 4G radio."
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:15.000]   Or, gosh, it's a 10 year old car anyway,
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.880]   why don't you just buy a brand new car?
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.640]   This is difficult to say the least.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.440]   - Sanitize your inputs, boys and girls.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.280]   - Yes, that's it.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.280]   - What I will say though, is I'm a big fan
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.040]   of 99% invisible.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.280]   And so I recommend that if you haven't listened
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.440]   to that podcast, they have a great one
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:33.040]   on how Goodnight Moon was not distributed
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.560]   at the New York Public Library for a very long time
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.800]   because the librarian there was setting the taste
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.440]   for all libraries in the United States
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.080]   about what children's books they should listen to.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.280]   - They banned Goodnight Moon?
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.840]   - They just didn't offer it or put it on the recommended list.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.440]   The woman who was the librarian
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.000]   and who was like this industry figure,
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.400]   but 99% invisible did a podcast about it
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.040]   called Goodnight Nobody.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.960]   And those of us who have kids who have memorized Goodnight Moon.
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.040]   - Me too, yep.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.240]   - Or just like what?
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.520]   So go listen to it, it's worth your time.
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.000]   - It's a great, it has never even heard of Goodnight Moon,
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:05.840]   but looking out at this.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.800]   - You don't have a huge piece of cultural history.
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.080]   - You don't have kids.
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.480]   Connie and I, I don't know about you Connie,
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.520]   but I went through probably 40 copies of Goodnight Moon
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:17.080]   until I found there's one that's a board book.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.600]   Oh, me was fabric and Abby couldn't tear the pages
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.760]   out of it as we went.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.000]   (both laughing)
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.880]   - Ian, you should just go up to YouTube
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.520]   and type in Goodnight Moon and the parodies of it
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.600]   are incredible. - Oh, really?
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.920]   - Samuel Jackson has a great one.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.280]   - Oh, fantastic.
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.080]   - Careful on that one, yes.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.600]   - Yeah, that's not safe for work,
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.680]   but Goodnight Moon is definitely
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.600]   as a cultural institution to all of us, kids.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.200]   - Margaret Weissner, I've only been here a dozen years,
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.040]   but I'm still getting used to this kind of stuff.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:49.880]   I mean, I'd never even heard of the cat in the hat
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.920]   till I came over here, so it's just, yes,
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.680]   it is a cultural divide.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.520]   - That's... (both laughing)
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.040]   - The Samuel, we had a couple of years in a row,
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.760]   we did a 24-hour New Year's Eve telecaste,
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.800]   and that was the closer one year.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:12.200]   I read Goodnight Moon to a group of small children
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.280]   and got a lot of trouble. (laughs)
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.800]   The Samuel Jackson version. (laughs)
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:20.160]   (all laughing)
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.280]   - That probably should have been vetted.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.440]   - Yeah, maybe the librarian was right,
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.280]   at least in that case.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.640]   No, that's great, 99% invisible, excellent podcast.
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:32.920]   Do not listen in 2016, Mazda, otherwise you're good.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.240]   - You're fine.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.960]   - Speaking of bugs, Elon Musk got bit
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.280]   by a solar storm last week.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.440]   The story from theregister.com. (laughs)
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.840]   SpaceX launched, even though the Space Weatherman
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.960]   predicted tricky conditions.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.800]   Wait a minute, there's a Space Weatherman Ian?
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.240]   - Oh, we have satellites out between us
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.600]   and the Sun now, thank goodness,
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.000]   which will predict when solar storms are coming in
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.800]   and give us the two days notice we need
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.440]   to lock down transformers and take preventative action.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:12.560]   In this case, it was more that solar activity hit the Earth.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:16.480]   This causes the atmosphere to expand slightly.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.360]   And because these satellites were in such a low orbit,
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.200]   that dramatically increased the amount of drag
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.000]   that they were undergoing.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.680]   And yes, 40 out of the 49 either have already fallen to Earth
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.400]   or are on the way back down.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.560]   - Wow.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.640]   Now, you have to put that in perspective.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.800]   SpaceX is manufacturing 100 of these a week
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.680]   and launching them as fast as they can.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:42.800]   So a certain percentage of loss is not the end of the world.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:46.320]   - Also, they're in low orbit, which is the,
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.920]   basically before they transition to their permanent orbits,
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.800]   they put into low orbits, partly for this reason,
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.240]   so that if during the checkout, they discover that,
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.760]   oh, this satellite's not gonna work out.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.520]   They can very easily just deorbit it
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.160]   and put into the ocean before it becomes
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.760]   like permanent addition to our collection of space junk.
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:06.240]   But that's, it's, I mean, that ties in
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.360]   to kind of another news story from, I think,
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.720]   from last week, where right now they're about 1700
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:13.320]   startling satellites in orbit.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.240]   They want permission to go into the tens of thousands.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.640]   And now the world science community is basically saying,
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.640]   yeah, we kind of don't want 40,000 new objects,
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:26.680]   basically a multiple of the number of orbiting objects
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:29.440]   around our planet at the moment
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.760]   to be there to service one company's profits,
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:35.480]   perhaps that will have an impact on our ability
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.960]   to not only put our own spacecraft into orbit,
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.560]   but also to just see beyond our own planet.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.200]   Perhaps you should just tap the brakes on that Elon.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.640]   - On the other hand, I talked to somebody living in
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:51.160]   rural, where were you, rural Texas,
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.040]   who has no internet access at all,
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.520]   and she just got her satellite,
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.400]   she's so excited about starting like, go ahead Connie,
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.080]   what did you think we were gonna talk about?
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.480]   - I thought you were gonna mention Elon Musk
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:02.160]   because of all the Tesla recalls,
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.040]   'cause like, wasn't there three or four last week,
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:06.480]   but that's another story, we can do that another day.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.280]   - Elon is the gift that just keeps on giving
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.240]   to tech journalists.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:15.080]   On the one hand, he's nuts.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.840]   On the other hand, he's incredibly brilliant.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.920]   I don't know, it's so, that's a combination
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.760]   that always works out great for you.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.360]   Well, we do know if you saw the movie,
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.400]   the Netflix movie now nominated for an Oscar,
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.480]   don't look up, that the evil billionaire genius,
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.360]   Mark Reiland, who plays that character in the movie,
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.880]   admitted now, yes, it's based on Elon Musk.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.600]   I thought maybe there was a little Mark Zuckerberg
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.920]   thrown in there for a good measure.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.480]   - Well, I mean, with Elon, the Germans have a great word
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.880]   for it, which is Fashir Diod,
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.240]   which is someone who is absolutely superb
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.320]   in their specialist area,
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.600]   and then ignorant as hell about other things.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.120]   But yeah, I mean, with a SpaceX thing,
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.840]   to their credit, I interviewed Don Kessler,
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.920]   he of the Kessler Effect a few years back,
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:04.160]   and he was like, "SpaceX are actually pretty good about
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.360]   "pretty planning to deorbit this stuff."
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.560]   - Oh, I see, yes.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:11.360]   - In a way that many national governments aren't.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.720]   But I'm totally with you on this.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.520]   The amount of problems this is causing astronomers
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.440]   and the potential problems, if it all goes wrong.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.680]   Somebody needs to stop and say,
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:23.880]   "Look, have you really thought this one through
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.640]   "other than with your own company's interests?"
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.960]   - Well, we know.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.040]   - But Mike, that's as I said,
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:33.120]   the International Space Station is going to deorbit,
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.640]   the word they use sometime in the next 10 years,
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.360]   probably 2030 or later.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.520]   But they learned from Skylab.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.840]   Remember in the late '70s,
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.160]   Skylab started orbit, started decay,
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.680]   and then nobody thought about it, nobody had planned.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.560]   So it just, all they could do was let it crash.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.760]   They figured, "Well, it's mostly water,
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.040]   "so we're probably all right."
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.480]   In fact, it crashed in Australia,
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.000]   but that's another story for another day.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.120]   I think they learned the lesson.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:08.120]   And so now there is enough juice to deorbit it
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:11.280]   in such a way that will crash into the Pacific.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.760]   - There is actually, there's actually,
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:13.680]   go ahead, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.640]   I think you're about to say what I was going to say.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.360]   - There's an effort to clean up space debris,
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.360]   that where you're going to say Andy,
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.080]   and that the US is very far behind.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.200]   We put up a lot of junk,
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.200]   but we've been really bad about taking it down.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.720]   We're number one.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:26.840]   - Yeah, so I know that there are private companies
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.200]   that want to go drag some of these space parts
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:33.840]   into low orbit, so they supposedly burn up on reentry,
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.040]   but that sounds like a bad plan too.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.360]   - Well, I think it was a business, right?
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.200]   - Yes.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.680]   - That somebody, somebody's, a British company
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:45.680]   is proposing a giant space net.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:51.040]   To, it's the remove debris satellite.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.840]   And it's a giant space net,
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:00.040]   it's actually been deployed to capture space junk.
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.800]   (laughing)
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:03.240]   - It's from Airbus.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:04.440]   Thank you very much.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.600]   - Combining the cutting edge bus technology
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.040]   to unprecedented aerodynamics.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.760]   - Yeah, for years now there have been satellite,
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:18.040]   China started launching satellites, I think in 2016,
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:22.080]   that have been testing grappling features
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.600]   so that it can actually interact with other satellites,
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.640]   move them into different orbits,
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.480]   pull them out of orbit, in necessary.
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:31.440]   And a lot of the conversations have been,
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.560]   oh, there's gonna be new wars in space
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:34.960]   in which we attack each other's satellites.
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.360]   I know that's, and I know that's actually,
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.480]   that's a likely possibility in the grand scheme of things,
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.880]   but also this is a necessary technology.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:44.800]   We need the ability to simply say,
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.480]   when there's a conflict between two spacecraft,
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.720]   one of which is derelict, we need an ability,
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.040]   and we need an ability to deal with it,
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.240]   that doesn't simply come down to,
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.280]   this spacecraft has to get out of the way.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.920]   There's a, what was it, two, three years ago,
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.000]   where there was a, another incident,
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.080]   I wish I could remember the actual details,
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.600]   but the Air Force that was tracking all this information,
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:09.560]   basically gave a warning to the operators of one spacecraft
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.880]   that look, you're basically about to crash
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:15.080]   into something else, and because there was no specific,
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.600]   or no chain of orders in place to say that,
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.120]   look, if you are operating a spacecraft,
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.160]   you have to have somebody manning a station,
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.920]   so that if we send you this warning,
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.240]   somebody gets it, somebody puts it into the right hands,
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.920]   and you take action, but unfortunately,
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.920]   it sat in somebody's inbox for three or four days,
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.800]   and a certain amount of emergency action had to be taken
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.280]   to avoid a crash that would have put a whole bunch
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.920]   of new debris into space.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.960]   - Isn't that the plot for the movie Gravity?
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:39.800]   Sandra Bullock?
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:41.200]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:44.280]   They get, she gets hit by a space debris.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.280]   - Oh, that film draws me nuts.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:47.840]   I mean, there's a space geek,
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.280]   it's just like, really, you can transfer orbits
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.160]   that easily, just to use it, but anyway.
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.880]   But I mean, it is a massive problem.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:56.480]   - She's Sandra Bullock, she can do anything.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.880]   (laughing)
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:02.000]   - Yeah, well, it's not as bad as Armageddon,
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.440]   which rumor has it, is still shown to potential
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.080]   NASA employees to find out how many inaccuracies you get.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.960]   And the record is, as I understand it, is 167.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:11.800]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.800]   - Okay, you clearly have this screen space camp,
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.720]   which I saw with a bunch of,
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.560]   where they call it.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.040]   - Oh, that's hilariously bad.
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:24.160]   - My Polytechnic University.
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.000]   People who like study.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.600]   - Hey, Moonfall is now at the top of the,
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:27.960]   don't watch list for me.
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:28.800]   (laughing)
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.360]   - Okay, but at least, at least, at least,
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:33.200]   at least from, from what I hear from a lot of people,
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.360]   it's bad and it's crazy, but it's like,
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:37.040]   national treasure level bad,
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.240]   where they know that they're going nuts here
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:40.560]   and they're leaning into it.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:43.480]   And like, if only they had Nicholas Cage in there,
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.080]   then the people would have understand,
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.520]   okay, look, we know the science here is wonky.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:50.080]   We're just having a good time here.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.040]   - It is kind of the same plot, isn't it?
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:53.160]   Although this time it's the Moon,
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:56.040]   not a, not a, not an asteroid, right?
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:56.880]   - True.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.200]   - This is the Moon breaking up.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.440]   This, this, this one that I've,
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:00.280]   - Yeah, the same, yeah.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.440]   - Like a Neil, Patrick Wilson.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.400]   - This seemed like a Neil Stevenson plot, but,
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.480]   but it's, it's a movie where there is a line,
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.960]   I need you to help me get in touch with NASA right now.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:12.240]   (laughing)
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.840]   The Moon is out of orbit.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.880]   - Yeah, it's got a twist.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:17.200]   The Moon is not what you think.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:18.040]   - Oh.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:18.880]   - Cause I actually have seen it.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.440]   And I interviewed the director,
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.040]   Roland Emmerich this past week,
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.320]   cause he's the guy who wrote Independence Day.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.160]   - Yeah.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:28.040]   - And a bunch of, he's done a bunch of movies
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.080]   and it is ridiculous.
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:30.920]   (laughing)
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:31.920]   - I've seen so many bad reviews
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.320]   and yet I really want to see it.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.600]   They tried to explain it.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:39.320]   We're de, oh, don't watch the trailer.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.880]   It's a spoiler alert.
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.360]   (gasps)
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:43.640]   I'm not gonna say anything.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:45.840]   Connie, now I understand what you're talking about.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.680]   - Yeah.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.440]   - Well, some Roland Emmerich will do 2012, the film.
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.000]   - He did the day after tomorrow,
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.040]   which was the climate change one.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:56.880]   - Yeah.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.880]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:58.720]   - Yeah.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.640]   - Yeah, okay, was 2012, which was a try to do.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:03.480]   - Why did you see a film?
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.320]   - And let me ask you,
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.200]   and did you see it in the theater more, more to the point?
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:07.040]   - No, no, no.
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:08.040]   I had the opportunity.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:11.720]   I get to co-host a podcast for CNET called I'm So Obsessed.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:14.800]   And we talked to actors, directors, other creative types.
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.960]   And I was able to screen it ahead of time
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:19.160]   in my living room.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:21.520]   And then I talked to the director, Roland Emmerich.
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:22.520]   - Oh, nice.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.200]   - A couple of days before it was launched.
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.680]   So-- - Good stuff.
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:27.840]   - Yeah, I mean, I'll watch anything
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:30.680]   because I'm stuck at home with anybody.
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.600]   And I love Sci-Fi. - 'Cause you're so obsessed.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.120]   That's why. - Well, it's just--
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:37.000]   - You know who's obsessed is the 19-year-old teenager,
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.680]   Jack Sweeney, who tweets the location of Elon Musk's jet.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:46.680]   Which he points out on his Twitter feed is completely legal.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.800]   (laughing)
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.960]   Elon, I like it so much.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.000]   And has offered him all sorts of things.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.080]   Jack says, "I want a car."
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.320]   (laughing)
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.520]   It started as a hobby,
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.880]   and I don't wanna let go of a hobby
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.880]   for something that's not gonna really change my life.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:06.520]   I don't have a car right now.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:07.960]   It would be great to have a car,
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:10.440]   and a Tesla would be really cool.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.080]   (laughing)
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.200]   - And so Elon blocked him in her.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.840]   - Well, Elon said it's a security issue.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.960]   I guess it is, but it's public information.
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.320]   It's not, this is all in the public database.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.480]   So Elon apparently offered him $5,000.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.760]   Now I should point out Elon Musk
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:32.440]   is the richest man in the world with $224 billion.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.040]   I mean, if I were Jack might be insulted by $5,000.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.280]   A car wouldn't be too much to ask.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.160]   He also tracks the private jets from Jeff Bezos,
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:45.720]   Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Donald Trump.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.640]   So if you follow him on Twitter, Elon Jet.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.240]   - Can I say that if the guy is smart,
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.600]   he'll ask for an electric car
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:54.600]   that's a little bit better made than a Tesla.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.080]   (laughing)
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.440]   That treats his employees a little bit.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.600]   That would be the height of irony is to say,
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.160]   "Elon, I want a car, but anything but a Tesla."
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.760]   Okay? (laughing)
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:06.440]   Those panel gaps, I just can't, I can't eat.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.960]   I don't wanna be made fun of in cars and cars.
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:08.960]   - Oh my God.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:10.440]   - Little break. - Oh, no, I mean.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.000]   - Go, I'm gonna make you take a break,
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.800]   go have some Marmite or whatever it is you.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:17.080]   (laughing)
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.400]   British people.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:19.600]   - That's very nationalist of you.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:20.960]   (laughing)
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:23.200]   - I personally-- - Why don't you go eat a Twinkie?
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:26.640]   - If I'm gonna eat the effluent from a brewery,
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.080]   I'm gonna eat Vegemite.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.200]   I mean, I'm just saying, given the choice.
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:33.200]   - I've tried so hard with you, Leon.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.040]   (laughing)
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.680]   Yeah, I just, I don't know where to start.
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:38.160]   Vegemite is sickly sweet.
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:39.000]   - It's horrible stuff.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:39.840]   - Is it sweet?
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.280]   It seems salty, but you're saying--
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.640]   - They put caramel in it.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.360]   I mean, compared to proper Marmite,
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.360]   they put caramel in it.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.520]   - Now that's a good idea. - Which is a good idea.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.800]   - That's a good idea. - It's really not.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.280]   But, now do you want it to reach their own, you know?
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:54.080]   - I was present at the dismantling
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:55.560]   of the Marin Brewing Company,
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.560]   which had failed for some reason in Marin,
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.360]   and watching them cart out the used hops
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.320]   or whatever it is, the debris at the bottom
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.120]   of the vats, and I thought, "Dude!"
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.280]   - Oh, the walt, yeah.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.880]   - Walt, you call it walt.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.320]   - Brewers walt, yes.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:16.440]   - Brewers walt, W-O-R-T?
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.360]   - I believe so, yes.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.360]   I would need to check that.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.760]   - Is that what Marmite is made of?
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:23.840]   - Well, that's the remains of the yeast
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.600]   that's gone through various different,
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.040]   yeah, gone through various things,
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.760]   which makes it vegetarian-friendly as well.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.040]   But-- - I almost shouted out
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:31.720]   to the guys, "You're missing a bet here.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.640]   "We need an American Marmite."
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:35.800]   You know, this is your shot.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.680]   - I don't know, it doesn't seem to work over here.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.720]   My wife, to her credit, tried it twice,
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.640]   and then said, "Never again."
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.360]   - I have two jars, one of Vegemite, one of Marmite,
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.240]   in my cupboard at home,
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.480]   and I've had them for years for some reason.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.120]   (laughs)
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.440]   They don't seem to be going anywhere.
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:53.800]   - Well, never goes off, so--
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.200]   (laughs)
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:57.120]   - Never goes bad.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.000]   Just like Brewers walt.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.600]   Our show today brought to you by checkout.com.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:06.000]   Tech, my friends, should not stifle innovation.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.280]   Traditional payment systems can really,
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:13.320]   you know, be heavily layered, disconnected.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.240]   And I think most businesses see them as a cost center, right?
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:20.240]   Modern businesses need a flexible payment system
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.720]   that can help them adapt to change, to grow,
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.400]   and to scale fast.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.800]   And I can tell you, there's a company with Tech
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.120]   that has a brand new, radical new way of thinking
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:33.640]   about this, it's checkout.com, well named.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.200]   Checkout.com.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:36.960]   They partnered with Oxford Economics,
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:39.680]   conducted an end-to-end analysis
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.480]   of the payments value chain for merchants.
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:45.760]   Last year alone in the UK, the US, and France,
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.960]   oh, in Germany too, false declines.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.960]   False, not real ones, but declines for a spurious reason
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:59.120]   cost markets, $20.3 billion.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:00.960]   What happens after you get a false decline?
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:03.800]   Most people just go to competitors, $12.7 billion,
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:06.960]   went to competitors, $7.6 billion,
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.200]   entirely written off.
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:11.320]   The sales, no sale, bye bye, see you later.
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:14.160]   And how many times have you and I done that, right?
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.920]   The study found merchants that are not currently optimizing
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:19.000]   the consumers' willingness to pay.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.080]   They're there, we are there pressing the pay button
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.440]   for speed, convenience, and security online
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.600]   are missing the boat.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.280]   Unfortunately, the majority of merchants
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.560]   that they surveyed in this Oxford Economics study
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.840]   don't feel payments data is informing their business
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:38.240]   strategy or their innovation 56% of customers said
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:41.160]   they won't return to a site if they don't offer
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.520]   their preferred payment method.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:46.040]   That should scare you a little bit.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:49.240]   Most merchants spend more than 10% of their payments budget
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:53.480]   on stupid stuff, fixing disputes, fraud, outages,
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:57.480]   stuff you can avoidable expenses, 10%.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:00.880]   CEOs are more likely to overestimate the quality
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.080]   of the data returned to them by payment providers.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.480]   It's not as good as you think.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:07.320]   CEOs tend to underestimate the extent
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.040]   to which disconnected payments are hidden
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.840]   in their growth.
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:13.600]   Most merchants focus on the per transaction costs
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:16.080]   to their payments and ignore the back end costs.

[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:42.080]   John, can you tell me what I'm seeing on the Super Bowl
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:42.840]   screen?
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:44.880]   It's just a bouncing QR code.
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:48.320]   Is this one of those dumb ads where they didn't want to spend
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.520]   any money on budget?
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.280]   There's no audio.
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:54.080]   It's just bouncing around.
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.600]   Oh, it's a Coinbase ad.
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:58.600]   How about that?
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.080]   That'll get some attention.
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:02.800]   They literally spent $6.5 million
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:07.280]   to put a bouncing QR code on your screen for 30 seconds.
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.280]   And we were talking just about this, right?
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.440]   The money these guys have.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.360]   Unbelievable.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.000]   Oh, God.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.440]   I hope against hope that it takes you
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.800]   to a Rick Astley video.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:18.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.000]   Now then, OK, points for style for sure on that.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:23.600]   Good one.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.200]   That would be hysterical.
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:27.720]   Well, there was a lovely tweet this week where--
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.680]   because the Queen had made an announcement about Prince
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:33.520]   Charles, his wife Camilla, actually being Queen Camilla
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:35.840]   when the Queen passes on.
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:38.000]   But she was pictured next to a bunch of documents
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000]   in her Queen's box, which she reads to go through.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.080]   And somebody of security specialists
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:46.040]   drove down and looked at what Photoshop could do to actually
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.600]   find out one of these things.
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.680]   And then, now we've revealed the final document.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:51.320]   And it was never going to give you up.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:51.720]   Never going to give you--
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:52.720]   Whoa!
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:53.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.640]   It was a great payoff.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.120]   But he was making a serious point.
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.000]   We have it with us, our royalty watcher.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:58.960]   Is the Queen OK?
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:05.440]   There's some worry because Charles has COVID, right?
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.080]   And he was with the Queen two days earlier.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:09.760]   And she's 95.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:10.680]   Congratulations.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:14.120]   Her platinum jubilee was last week.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.240]   70 years, the longest reigning monarch in the UK.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:18.760]   And his--
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:21.160]   August reigning monarch in history, as I understand it.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:22.000]   70 years.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:22.720]   Well, we don't know.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:24.120]   I might be Ozamandias.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.240]   Well, yes, true.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.720]   True, but still.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:29.720]   I mean, I'm not a huge fan of the womb system of government,
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:32.520]   but she is a game old bird.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.720]   She's done the best for the country.
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:35.360]   Bird.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:39.160]   Lisa said-- Lisa told me you're very respectful of the Queen.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.520]   That's why I thought you might be.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:42.360]   Honestly, if we're going to have a monarch,
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:43.920]   she's the probably best of a lot.
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:44.400]   She's really good.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.800]   Her idiot son, on the other hand,
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.280]   I'm having problems with.
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.320]   Yes.
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:51.120]   He is in lockdown with COVID-19.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:54.640]   It's reported that Andrew is in lockdown with Mandy 17,
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:58.640]   but isn't coming out until Mumsie tells the police to go away.
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:02.320]   That's a pretty joke for those of you listening who say what?
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:03.480]   Yes, OK.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:03.960]   We have football.
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.680]   They have the royal family.
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:06.200]   Yes.
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:10.720]   I mean, she may be OK, but she's just lost husband.
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.280]   And typically, when older couples, when one of them dies,
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:16.040]   the other one dies within a year or so.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.040]   I know.
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:20.720]   She has a new family around her, lots of corgis.
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.000]   And the other thing that I think was
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.720]   reprehensible was Boris Johnson, who
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:28.440]   got dinged for holding all these parties at 10 Downing
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.720]   Street, while the poor Queen has to sit all by herself
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:32.880]   at her husband's funeral.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:35.360]   Literally the day before her husband's funeral,
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:37.240]   they were having a party.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:39.160]   It's the day before.
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:41.440]   I mean, I've got--
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.000]   well, that was used to get too personal,
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.360]   but myself and others have had people die over this--
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.360]   Yes.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:47.400]   --epidemic, and we can go and see them.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:49.240]   We couldn't go and give them comfort.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.520]   And in one case, my aunt had to die in a hospice,
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.440]   because she wasn't even allowed to go home.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:58.640]   I've yet to see British people this angry about something
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:00.040]   for quite some time.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:02.760]   But Boris seems to be prepared to just bracing it out.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:05.680]   He has no shame whatsoever.
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:09.520]   By the way, that was a Coinbase QR code.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:13.280]   And Twitter is going crazy right now.
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:14.520]   Here's a tweet from Neil Rule.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:18.080]   It's funny to watch my son scan that Coinbase QR code.
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.840]   The ad worked.
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:22.600]   The ad worked.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.640]   Did he actually mention it?
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:24.360]   Scan it, though.
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.480]   That's a little bit of TV.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:27.320]   It worked.
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:29.680]   Coinbase is trending on Twitter right now,
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:33.880]   which is probably what they wanted.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:37.080]   Here's a picture of me when the Coinbase commercial came on.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:42.840]   Actually, some of the PRs coming across that.
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:45.160]   That was actually directed by Ridley Scott.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:50.760]   Wow, he's so loud.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:52.000]   Best ad of the Super Bowl.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:52.520]   Here it is.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:55.320]   Basically, I'll give them an extra-- they only
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.520]   charge them $150 for this.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.160]   There it is.
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:01.600]   The best ad of the Super Bowl, a bouncing QR code.
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:03.040]   We had a great week this week on Twitter.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:03.960]   Let's take a look.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:08.120]   We made a little mini movie to celebrate.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.000]   I have a question regarding the iPad.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.240]   Yes, sir.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:15.280]   I'm sorry I didn't have to call you back.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:16.480]   I have a yell at the NBA.
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:18.520]   OK, yeah, go ahead.
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.080]   We don't want anybody yelling at you.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.640]   Hey, what are you doing in the phone there?
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:22.920]   Get off the phone.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:25.240]   Kim, just keep an ear out.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:28.400]   When he's done with the altercation,
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.400]   pretty decent.
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.960]   Onto it.
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.520]   To it news.
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:35.040]   Kind of the marquee device for the event.
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:36.720]   And the thing that I was looking forward to most
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:39.160]   was the S22 Ultra.
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:41.760]   This is, by all accounts, this is
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:42.960]   the next note, right?
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.200]   It's a note by a different name.
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:46.720]   It's the Galaxy S22 Ultra.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:47.880]   Tech news weekly.
[01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:49.120]   Oh my gosh.
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:52.840]   Do we have the next Samsung phone in hand, right?
[01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.640]   Oh, no.
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:55.600]   You're so lucky.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:56.760]   I'm so jealous.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:57.960]   This week in Google.
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.800]   Actually, feature writing dying is a symptom of a lot.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:01.960]   I mean, there are still-- by the way,
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:03.160]   there's still great feature writing.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:04.240]   That's what New Yorker does.
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:04.600]   It's what the--
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.760]   For a few outlets for it.
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.800]   And I really do wonder if people are
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:11.680]   going to read long form anything in the years to come.
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:14.760]   If they'll have long form podcasting, long form--
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.560]   well, God knows we do those.
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:18.240]   Twitter.
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:19.560]   Those aren't even well researched.
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:20.560]   Read my goodness.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:24.000]   Are the new harpers one point?
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.920]   I'm glad you're not airing this right now.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:26.880]   Oh, is it bad?
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.520]   Is it getting bad?
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:31.280]   Are they swearing?
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.320]   This is actually better than hearing.
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:34.920]   I would be-- it would upset my tummy
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.720]   to hear them actually fighting.
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:39.760]   But hearing your reaction is kind of fun.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.200]   The guy called-- this is the fun, the joy of live call
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.080]   in radio.
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:45.440]   The guy was on Venice Beach.
[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:48.840]   It was 88 degrees on Saturday on Venice Beach.
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.720]   He starts asking me a question.
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:54.080]   And some nut comes up and starts haranging him.
[01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:55.840]   And Kim was actually doing a play by play.
[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:57.320]   And apparently, he got pretty profane.
[01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:01.200]   There was some comparison.
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:03.120]   I don't even want-- I shouldn't even--
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:07.760]   I should just stop right now.
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:10.000]   Ian, article from The Register.
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:10.640]   You writing.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.720]   You're doing a little writing.
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:12.800]   Chip Shortage is sure.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:17.640]   But it's a good time to be a Silicon wafer maker.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:18.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.160]   The revenues have-- they've had the biggest bump a year
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:25.480]   since 2007 when the last big bubble broke.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.440]   Yeah, it's a great time to be in Silicon.
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:31.560]   But 2023 and 24 are going to be quite unpleasant to them,
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.120]   I think, because oversupply is going
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.200]   to kick in at that point, particularly in things
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.160]   like 28 nanometers of processed stuff.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:39.600]   I worry, because everybody's building all this capacity.
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.840]   And by the way, we talked about this last week,
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:44.640]   not just the Intel's and the TSMC's of the world,
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:47.600]   but even the little legacy node factories are really
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.640]   ramping up because there's a huge demand.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:53.440]   But when they're all online, what's going to happen?
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:56.320]   Well, I mean, this is-- in the long term,
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:58.480]   the demand for processors and chip technology
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:00:59.680]   is only going to grow.
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:01.720]   But it's managing those peaks and troughs.
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:03.960]   And yes, there's enormous build, build,
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:06.280]   build function because of the chip shortages
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:08.880]   and the resulting supply chain issues.
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:11.680]   But yeah, the hangover is going to come.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:14.120]   And it's a question of judging when
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:17.560]   and how you spend your money in terms of building new fabs,
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.440]   building new manufacturing processes.
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.680]   Yeah.
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:22.120]   I'll tell you the business you don't
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:27.720]   want to be in ensuring VR headset claims.
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:31.000]   There's a British company called Aviva, British insurer,
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000]   who apparently does sell, in fact, a home insurance
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.480]   for damage caused by VR headsets.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.160]   They say there's been a 31% jump in claims last year.
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:48.080]   And overall, since 2016, a 68% jump,
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:52.640]   they cite a man who landed an uppercut on a ceiling fan.
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:54.080]   I don't know who got the worst of that.
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:55.960]   A woman slamming into furniture.
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:59.400]   A guy smashing through a lighting fixture.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.360]   One child.
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.080]   Smashed two designer figurines.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:07.600]   I'm thinking Hummel's perched on the mantelpiece
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.400]   when his game demanded a swipe move.
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:13.400]   There goes the Hummel's flying.
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:15.800]   And honestly, the kid might have done it on purpose.
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:20.600]   I'm just thinking, but you know, saying one customer
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:23.480]   launched a controller to his TV when a zombie jumped out
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:23.960]   during the game.
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:26.040]   Ah, I can see you.
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:26.680]   I can do that.
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:28.080]   I can see you doing that.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:32.320]   Aviva said we did pay the claims, but they weren't warned.
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.920]   This is from Aviva spokesperson.
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:38.120]   I want to say Dick Whittington, but it's Kelly Whittington.
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:42.320]   These devices can be a great source of fun.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:45.000]   But we didn't, I'm sounding like the Geico Gecko, aren't I?
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:45.920]   But we...
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:47.400]   Hey, y'all. What are you doing?
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.840]   We didn't encourage people to be mindful of their surroundings,
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.480]   Governor, and take a look at their home insurance
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.960]   to make sure it suits their needs.
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.520]   You got to plug in.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:57.920]   You got to plug in.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:00.120]   Not a surprise.
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:03.600]   Because I'm rising 68% given the very low statistical base
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:05.920]   of VR stuff before 2016.
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:06.920]   That's not a surprise.
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:07.720]   That's not a surprise.
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.120]   Not a surprise.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:12.120]   And, but the best thing I got out of that article
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:15.720]   was it turns out there is a subreddit, a forum on Reddit
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:18.520]   called VRToER.
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:20.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:21.720]   I need to see this.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:23.120]   It is dedicated.
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:25.120]   I immediately subscribed, of course.
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:29.920]   This is dedicated to damage caused during VR accidents.
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:33.920]   Yeah, does that have the picture of the Oculus controller?
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.920]   It's like smashed.
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:35.920]   That's like just...
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:37.920]   Oh, it's meddling in the TV.
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:39.920]   And then it's technically a whole and dry wall.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:40.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:41.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:42.920]   Welcome to the metaverse.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:44.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:45.920]   It's going to be fun, isn't it?
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:46.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:48.920]   Well, honestly, based on their results,
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:51.920]   Facebook needed to be fun because their cool market's dying.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:52.920]   You know what?
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:55.920]   I have to say, Facebook is not making it look fun.
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:56.920]   No.
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:57.920]   Now they've established...
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:58.920]   It's like Second Life.
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:03:59.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:02.920]   Something, some of the stuff they've been putting out is Sub-Second Life.
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:07.520]   Well, and because of that, they're worried now about VR harassment.
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:10.920]   So they're establishing a four-foot...
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:12.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:19.200]   No fly zone around every avatar so that you can't get harassed.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:21.800]   Which isn't really that encouraging about like, "Oh, good.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:23.120]   Well, I'm glad they did that because..."
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:29.120]   Well, there have been a couple of incidents like that where...
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:31.120]   Digital griefing, I guess.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:38.120]   Well, not just griefing, but in virtual reality avatars, reaching out and touching people
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:42.120]   in a way that even through virtual reality, they did not want to be touched.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.120]   Unwanted touching.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.120]   Show us on the avatar where he touched you.
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:47.120]   Well, it is...
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:51.120]   You don't even have legs in virtual reality, so I don't know.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:54.120]   It's part of what...
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:58.120]   It's part of the development process of something that's brand new to society.
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:02.520]   It may not be something that was even considered a couple of years ago, but then when you put
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:07.800]   millions of people inside this environment, this is how it feels for some people who are
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:13.120]   maybe in real world being harassed and being victims of that sort of thing.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.120]   I do not need this.
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:16.120]   This is way, way too real.
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:19.120]   I do feel like it's a violation, even though it's just pixels.
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:20.120]   So now, how do you prosecute it?
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:21.120]   How do you ban it?
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.120]   How do you limit it?
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:29.120]   So now, instead of 2,000 reasons, why Meta has a really stupid idea for a pivot, add one
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:30.120]   more.
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:37.120]   Connie, I'm going to let you get your smartphone ready for the QR code in the second half because...
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:39.120]   We're going to let you get to the football game in a second.
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:40.120]   One last story.
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:45.120]   A big breakthrough, I think, for streaming in the Oscars.
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:51.520]   This week's Oscar nominations gave Netflix power of the dog.
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:54.240]   Streaming only movie 12 nominations.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:59.080]   Remember Steven Spielberg a few years ago saying streaming movies shouldn't even be considered
[02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:00.400]   for Academy Awards.
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:07.440]   Apple got six nominations, including a Best Picture nomination for CODA.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:12.880]   This is, I think it is now clear, especially because of the pandemic, that streaming movies
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:16.720]   are movies.
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:20.840]   They're quite a few, including by the way, Don't Look Up, which was we were talking about,
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:23.480]   nominated for a Best Picture.
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:25.880]   And that was Netflix only as well.
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:33.760]   See, this is significant because the budget for CODA was $10 million, $10 million.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.640]   And it's a good example of the sort of movies that people used to become, excuse me, a lot
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:44.800]   of actors and a lot of producers used to be complaining that we can't sell a movie that
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:49.240]   costs less than X hundreds of millions of dollars because the market for movies and theaters
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:53.760]   right now is that by the time you add in marketing, by the time you add in distribution, it has
[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:57.960]   to make a huge pile of money before it can recoup its funding back.
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:01.880]   And so a lower budget or a mid-tier budget movie, which is usually what you're talking
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:05.440]   about when you're talking about a straight-on drama where people are just going to go in
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:08.200]   there and act the hell out of the screenplay.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:09.400]   That kind of aces all of them out.
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:15.280]   So it's not surprising at all that the streaming services that are largely enticed creators
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:20.240]   with, look, if you're going to be making us a movie for $10, $20, $30 million, we will
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:21.240]   write you the check.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:22.560]   You get to make the movie that you want.
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:26.200]   Here are some rules that we want you to follow, but we're not going to have someone on set
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:30.680]   every single moment advising you on what you shouldn't do.
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:36.160]   This is sort of like the gold rush, almost in terms of rewards and prestige for these
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.160]   smaller-tier movies.
[02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:39.160]   That might be the salvation for the street.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:40.160]   I'd love that.
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:41.160]   It's great for the drama.
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:43.760]   And let's bring back theaters eventually.
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:48.600]   And maybe they can benefit as well, the small indie theaters and art cinemas.
[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:52.680]   The theater has to become a communal activity again.
[02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:56.680]   You have to watch a movie as an audience, not just for the big picture, not just for
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:08:01.920]   the great sound, but there's something about the cheering that happens in an even an action
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:07.320]   movie where somebody picks up the weapon that from off-screen and suddenly enters the battle,
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:12.160]   that you realize that this is why I paid $12 for not the effects, but because one of
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:16.440]   200 people cheering like L at a static end.
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:20.600]   This is a weirdly American thing because if you did that in the UK, you would be considered
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:21.600]   incredibly rude.
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:22.600]   Yeah.
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.600]   I went and see it.
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:24.600]   I was surprised.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:28.000]   But yeah, you guys all rise to your feet at the end of the movie to sing God Save the Queen.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000]   Oh, please.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000]   Yes.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000]   Yes.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.680]   Well, that said, whenever I do hear the National Anthem, I get the urge to stand.
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.680]   But yes, it's.
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:37.240]   Do they still do that at movie theaters?
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:39.360]   This is a long time ago when I was in the UK.
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:40.640]   I don't think they still do that.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:44.040]   They used to play the National Anthem at the end of a movie.
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:47.760]   They used to play the National Anthem every night when the TV shut down at midnight.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:48.760]   Yeah, we did that too.
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:49.760]   Yeah, we did that too.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:50.760]   Yeah.
[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:51.760]   Back when TV's shut down.
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:53.400]   TVs don't shut down anymore.
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.400]   That's the problem.
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.400]   Yeah.
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:56.960]   I will say, I hope theaters come back too.
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:02.240]   My favorite movie event was the watching Galaxy Quest with an audience here in the Bay Area.
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:07.680]   And at the end of Galaxy Quest, every single fan stood up and applauded, including myself.
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:08.680]   Oh.
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:09.680]   So that is a moment.
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:10.680]   Isn't that correct?
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:15.600]   Yes, it is a recognition that the streaming services and their investment in studio production
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.600]   is countering the Hollywood.
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:20.880]   You have to have a hundred million dollar budget.
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:21.880]   And we want to see that.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:26.080]   I mean, I think the day that we get an Oscar nominated movie that was shot on an iPhone
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:31.880]   or on a Samsung phone is the day that we really sit down and go, what?
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:32.880]   Holy cow.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:33.880]   Yeah.
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:35.760]   Do you think that day will come?
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:36.760]   I do.
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:39.520]   I think movies are storytelling, right?
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:43.720]   And it's about compelling characters and stories.
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:46.400]   And I think a lot of, I mean, I'm a big movie buff.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:47.400]   Don't get me wrong.
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:48.400]   I will watch anything.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.640]   Moonfall was $140 million.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:51.640]   Wow.
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:55.360]   The largest budget for an independent movie ever raised.
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:57.760]   I liked Kota, which $10 million.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:03.360]   But I think that it's the creativity of the work.
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:09.000]   And if you're relying on big budget, special effects, that's a complaint of a lot of movies,
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000]   right?
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.800]   And the story was matte, but oh my God, they look at that explosion from 50 different
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:14.800]   angles.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:17.800]   So it will allow you to experiment.
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:21.480]   And I do think that day is coming.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:23.560]   And you can use this and I'm so obsessed if you want.
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:26.760]   I really think movies are the original VR, the VR that works.
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:31.120]   Yeah, you're not wearing a helmet, but you're in a darkened room with a bunch of other people.
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:35.360]   There's music to make your heart move.
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:38.560]   There's pictures on the screen that make you gasp.
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:41.320]   You a good movie takes you away.
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:43.920]   It transports you into a different space.
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:48.680]   It's 4D when they throw popcorn at you.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:49.680]   Connie Goyelmo.
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.440]   I'm so obsessed on CNET.
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:53.320]   She's editor in chief.
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:56.240]   That's CNET.com February 2nd.
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:10:57.240]   Roland Emmerich.
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:58.240]   That's a good interview.
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:10:59.240]   I'm going to have to listen to that.
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:00.240]   I can't.
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:01.240]   That's a great get.
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:02.240]   Wow.
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:03.640]   How cool is that?
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:06.360]   Anything else you want to mention that you're up to, Connie?
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.840]   No, I'm going to go and see what that silly chore is.
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:10.840]   You are, Coach.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:12.280]   I hope they do it in the second half too.
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:13.280]   I wonder.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:17.920]   Will they spell, it's been $13 million for a bouncing QR code.
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:18.920]   That's the only question.
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:19.920]   Thank you, Connie.
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:20.920]   It's really great to have you.
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:21.920]   My pleasure.
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:22.920]   Andy and I call.
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:28.540]   Tuesday, he's one of our hosts on Mac Break Weekly, also appears on WGBH Boston every
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:34.600]   week and does the material podcast on relay.fm, which is ironically all about Android.
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:35.600]   You cover the waterfront.
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:36.600]   How about Google?
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:37.600]   Y'all about that?
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.600]   I'm ecumenical.
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.000]   I am braised, crazy technology of all faiths.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000]   Always a pleasure.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.480]   It's great to see you.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:43.480]   Thank you for being here.
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:44.480]   Thank you.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:46.640]   Ian Thompson, news editor.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:47.800]   I'm sorry.
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:48.800]   US editor now.
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:50.080]   It's all the same.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:51.080]   It's all the same.
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.480]   There's only three people.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:53.480]   It's the register.
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:54.480]   No, I'm kidding.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:55.480]   It's the register.com.
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:59.920]   It's a great publication, which we quote every single week.
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.920]   Great to have you, Ian.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.240]   I'm only sorry that your wife took the car and we didn't get to have a...
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:07.840]   No, she's boogie building on Stinson Beach at the moment.
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:08.840]   Oh, man.
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:10.040]   I'm glad to head out to the pub.
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:11.040]   So, yeah, man.
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:12.920]   Yeah, summer came early in California.
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:14.640]   It's weird, actually.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:15.640]   It is.
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:17.680]   I hope y'all have a wonderful Valentine's Day tomorrow.
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:20.520]   I thank you all for joining us the day before.
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:25.160]   We do Twitch on a lovely Sunday afternoon.
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:26.320]   We're an after the radio show.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:30.560]   Usually it's around 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2230 UTC.
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:35.960]   If you want to watch us do it live, we stream live audio and video at live.twit.tv.
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:38.440]   If you're watching live, you can chat with us live.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.280]   There's two places to do that, of course.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:48.720]   The IRC open to all, IRC.twit.tv and our fabulous Discord.
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:51.760]   The folks in the Discord are members of Club Twit.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:55.200]   $7 a month gets you ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:13:00.960]   Access to the Discord with such great animated GIFs as this.
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:02.600]   God save the Queen.
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:07.800]   And you also get the Twit Plus feed, which we're doing thanks to the members of the club.
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:09.840]   We're kind of subsidizing this.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:10.840]   Some new stuff.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:16.360]   It's given us the chance to do this week in space with Rod Pyle, our space guy from the
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:21.480]   National Space Society and his co-host, Terrik Malek from space.com.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:23.520]   They talk about space every week.
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:28.280]   And of course the untitled Linux show, Jonathan Bennett, the host of that, Stacey Higginbotham's
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.520]   book club every month.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:33.600]   There's the Giz Fizz with Dicty Bartolo every week.
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.080]   There's also special events and interviews coming up February 24th.
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:39.320]   Oh, doctor.
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:44.280]   Ah, and ask me anything with Owen J. J. Stone, Aunt Pruitt, our community manager will host
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:45.840]   that should be something.
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:48.560]   That should be amazing in fact.
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:50.680]   Thank you, Owen, for doing that.
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:51.680]   Thank you, and for doing that.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.480]   And thank you, club members, for making it possible.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:58.160]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:59.600]   By the way, we do have corporate memberships.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:05.160]   We want to welcome yet another corporate membership, another company, buying subscriptions
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:07.520]   for their employees.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:08.600]   That warms me.
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:09.600]   That warms my heart.
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:12.000]   Thank you for your support.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.960]   If you want to watch the show after the fact, of course there's free versions.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:20.400]   And supportive versions of everything else we do available at our website, twit.tv.
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:22.520]   There's a YouTube channel for all of the Twitch shows.
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:26.000]   If you want to watch the video there, you certainly can.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.840]   My favorite thing to do though, subscribe and a podcast player.
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:29.840]   That way you get it automatically.
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:31.480]   You don't even have to think about it.
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:35.120]   And watch or listen at your leisure.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:39.960]   And if your podcast player supports reviews, please leave us a five-star review.
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:44.560]   The longest continuous running tech podcast in the world.
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:47.160]   Now in its 17th year.
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:48.320]   Thanks for joining us all.
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:50.160]   17 years I've been saying it, I'll say it again.
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:51.160]   Another twit.
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.160]   This is amazing.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:53.160]   This is amazing.
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:53.160]   Bye-bye.
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:15:04.920]   Bye-bye.
