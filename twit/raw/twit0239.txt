[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.820]   We are live from the Texas Co-working Center
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.820]   in beautiful Austin, Texas.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.820]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.820]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820]   Wow.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.820]   It sounds like a crowd of 3,400 people the same number
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.820]   that were at the Ignatian Party yesterday.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.820]   You think I could crowd surf this group?
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.820]   No.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.820]   No.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.820]   The bad idea, wouldn't it?
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.820]   I don't think they could hold me.
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820]   To my right, Mr. Tom Merritt from Buzz Out Loud.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.820]   Hey, Tom.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.820]   Hey, Leo.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.820]   Great to see you.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.820]   Welcome.
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.820]   Thank you.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.820]   Molly Wood is also here.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.820]   Your cohort from Buzz Out Loud.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.820]   Hi, Molly.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.820]   Hello.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.820]   Good to be here.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.820]   Thanks for coming.
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.820]   We've never been on TWIT together before.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.820]   What?
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.820]   Is that true?
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.820]   Oh, no.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.820]   I know we were sort of on TWIT.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.820]   Yes.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.820]   Yes.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.820]   You were together.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.820]   It's only ever on the road sharing a microphone.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.820]   Right.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.820]   It's like our--
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.820]   It's the same thing on that one.
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.820]   It's our traveling road trip.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.820]   But you were right on that one.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.820]   No, we do try to separate you.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.820]   We don't want to make it the Buzz Out Loud, TWIT.
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.820]   But it's good to have you both.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.820]   Hi, Sarah.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.820]   Hi.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.820]   Great to see you.
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.820]   Great to be here.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.820]   Yeah, talk right into the microphone.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.820]   Great to be here.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.820]   I know you're a treacherous little ball of steel, but you have to work the mic still.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.820]   Okay.
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.820]   And look at it.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.820]   Robert Scobble's wearing his tattoo shirt.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.820]   It looks like you're the illustrated man.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.820]   That is awesome.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.820]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.820]   Your wrists are very wrinkled.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.820]   I sat down and I was like, "Dude, nobody told me Scobble had sleeves."
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.820]   Not did I not notice that before.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.820]   And they're literally sleeves.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.820]   There's a tattoo parlor here on 6th Street that spells tattoo with 1.0.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.820]   And I thought, "Boy, that's not really a good advertisement for a tattoo parlor.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.820]   You can't even spell the word tattoo.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.820]   You really don't want to go in there and get, you know.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.820]   Permanent.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.820]   Maybe it's a tattoo removal place.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.820]   My mather loves me.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820]   You know, that's not going to work.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.820]   There's Dr. Kiki.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.820]   Hey, Dr. Kiki.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.820]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.820]   So you all are here.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.820]   Why?
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.820]   What is going on?
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.820]   Is this some event in town?
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.820]   It seems to be kind of big.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.820]   Woke up in Texas.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.820]   I know.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.820]   Austin is south by Southwest.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.820]   Yeah, but you got a sleeping Texas.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.820]   You're here for me?
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.820]   We're going to have a meet.
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.820]   Barbecue is very big.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.820]   I was going to, we're going to have a little party at a Brazilian place after this.
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.820]   But I heard that this is a barbecue town.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.820]   Scobble said we should have gone to a barbecue place.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.820]   Maybe we can have Brazilian barbecue.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.820]   It is Brazilian barbecue.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.820]   There we go then.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.820]   I discovered yesterday that you can actually get meat drunk.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.820]   So I think I actually have a little meat hangover today.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.820]   I was swaying.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.820]   I'm not going to lie.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.820]   Oh, you're, it's okay.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.820]   So there are a lot of different interpretations of meat drunk.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.820]   So what you're saying is you got drunk on meat.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.820]   I'm not touching that one.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.820]   I'm not touching that one.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.820]   Now we talked.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.820]   I didn't, never mind.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.820]   I'll just be right here with the coffee.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.820]   So how does that feel when you're drunk on meat?
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.820]   I was really, I was swaying and slightly delirious.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.820]   I had my body weight in barbecue yesterday.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.820]   Wow.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.820]   That's a bit.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.820]   That's like half a steer.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.820]   Were you at the dignity party?
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.820]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.820]   That's actually-
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.820]   That's not what I meant.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.820]   Half a steer.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.820]   Okay.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.820]   Was it a whole steer?
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.820]   Was it a steer?
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.820]   Like about a ton?
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.820]   Super.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.820]   Were you at the dignity party?
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.820]   No, because I couldn't be lifted for crowd surfing.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.820]   Because if you were, I would say you weren't stoned on meat.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.820]   That was a wild party.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.820]   That was a very wild party.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.820]   It's tubs, barbecue, another barbecue place.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.820]   In fact, I do have a little stubs barbecue because Tony Shea of Zappos has a party bus
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.820]   that was stocked with barbecue from stubs.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.820]   That was fun.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.820]   Did you go?
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.820]   It's the happiness bus or something.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.820]   You're a VHP.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.820]   Was it a good bus ride?
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.820]   You've been on the bus.
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.820]   Was it enjoyable?
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.820]   What happens on the bus stays on the bus?
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.820]   Let me put it this way.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.820]   It's a bus that comes with its own bartender.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.820]   Robert warned me, well, not me, but his entire Twitter following about over-cussing.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.820]   About over-consumption of alcohol here at South by South West.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.820]   You're not drinking at South by South West.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.820]   I've had half of a beer so far.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.820]   Wow.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.820]   Why is that?
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.820]   Because I went a little crazy last year.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.820]   Well, we've just let you get meat drunk.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.820]   So maybe a little later on you'd like to try that.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.820]   And after you get meat drunk, you can crowd surf.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.820]   That's a thrill and a half.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.820]   That was really fun.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.820]   I got to do that at the big nation party.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.820]   You look hard.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.820]   You didn't break anything bodily or equipment-wise?
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.820]   Yeah, how'd it go?
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.820]   Nor did I get groped.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.820]   I thought I might get groped, but I didn't.
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.820]   I don't know.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.820]   People were respectful overall with the lifting.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.820]   I think when there's that many hands on your butt, you really can't call it groped.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.820]   Somebody said on the hallway that they touch your butt and they don't want to do it again.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.820]   I was flexing.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.820]   I'm clenching.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.820]   Is that the word?
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.820]   Now the rumors of your buns of steel will go far.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.820]   You couldn't say it's groping your butt anymore.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.820]   Then you could say the floor gropes your butt when you lie down.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.820]   It's really like a wavy mattress.
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.820]   Was that your first time?
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.820]   Why, you've done this?
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.820]   No, I'm asking if it's your first time.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.820]   Unless you're really a party girl, girls are really going for crowd surfing.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.820]   No.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.820]   No.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.820]   Then you will get groped.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.820]   I was talking with people about it last night and saying, well, who would actually do this?
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.820]   And all the girls I asked for.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.820]   A guy.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.820]   No.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.820]   So, especially not with the dig boy crowd.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.820]   There were a large number of women in the dig audience.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.820]   There were quite a few girls.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.820]   I think one of them I've ever noticed at a live show.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.820]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.820]   South by Southwest is nice because it's not a bunch of fat overweight guys like me.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.820]   It's been, and Robert, there's a lot of women.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.820]   It's really a social media conference more than anything else.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.820]   This is my first time here.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.820]   Is this feel like a typical South by Southwest?
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.820]   It's far more busier.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.820]   It's a busier.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.820]   Fifty percent.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.820]   Supposedly, this was the first year that interactive registration exceeded music, which is, I mean, started as a music conference festival.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.820]   So, unbelievable.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.820]   Get right up to the mic because we are these mics.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.820]   Fifty percent more interactive folks here than last year.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.820]   Wow.
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.820]   I mean, if you walk down six street after 8 p.m.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.820]   Two years ago, there was only one or two parties that have lines.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.820]   Every party has lines now.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.820]   I remember being here when I lived here in 1993 and the music was it.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.820]   There was the film conference which meant you could go to the Dobi theater and see a bunch of films you wouldn't be able to normally see.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.820]   And there was really no problem getting into any of them.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.820]   And then there was the CD-ROM conference.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.820]   The Molti, I called it South by Southwest Multimedia.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.820]   And it was a bunch of CD-ROM authors in the convention center for a couple days.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:57.820]   And now to have it actually out draw the music is pre-mind-blowing.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.820]   Do you think social media will go the way of CD-ROMs?
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:11.820]   No, I think it's going to be a step towards whatever comes next, the semantic web and other things.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.820]   I mean, people are naturally social and social ability.
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.820]   Social ability?
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.820]   I can't say the word.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.820]   Just make up a word here.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.820]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.820]   That's going to be a huge part of everything on the web going forward.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.820]   So it's not going to go away. It'll just be folded in to the origami of the future.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.820]   The social media part of it feels like a little bit of a bubble right now.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.820]   I mean, you have to--
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.820]   Everybody you meet is a social media expert.
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.820]   Everybody's just-- well, it's seriously--
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.820]   Hey, have friends.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.820]   Like, no offense.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.820]   Can we social media guru?
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.820]   Like, really social media guru? Come on.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.820]   They're a lot of them.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.820]   That's a job. It's a job. Like, that's a bubble.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.820]   If that's a job, this is a bubble.
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.820]   That's a bubble.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.820]   No, but there was that PR guy who wrote the big article.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.820]   What are you talking about? That's my job.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.820]   I really like your sleeves.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.820]   Sponsored by Raxface.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.820]   It's not just a few people's job. It's not a specialized thing.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.820]   Now it sort of feels like everyone is just like, "Well, I'm on Twitter."
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.820]   So boom, guru.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.820]   Yeah, if you don't know what to put on your card, you put that.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.820]   I have 500 hours of social media expert.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.820]   Right.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.820]   But there is some stuff that is not a bubble.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.820]   I mean, it feels to me--
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.820]   maybe you guys would like to correct me on this--
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.820]   but it feels to me that there's this real creative surge
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.820]   that is kind of the culmination of inexpensive digital hardware
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.820]   and content creation tools and this incredible distribution
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.820]   media of the internet.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.820]   And everybody here seems to be starting a company
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.820]   or creating a website or a blog or podcast.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.820]   There's a lot of creativity here.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.820]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.820]   And I think that's why it's bigger, is because there are more people doing this.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.820]   Yeah. There's also a lot of criticism as well,
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.820]   though people coming in who have been going to South by Southwest.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.820]   This is my first year as well, so I don't have anything to compare it to.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.820]   But a lot of criticism as to, oh, well, you know, the panel sessions
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   aren't as creative as they used to be.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.820]   There are a lot of people who are the web posers.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.820]   You know, people aren't-- this isn't the thing that people aren't maybe getting
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.820]   what they thought they would get out of it.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.820]   I don't know what everyone else is thinking about that,
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.820]   like what you guys are thinking.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.820]   One of my staff went to a panel on what was it called, Lisa?
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.820]   How to do things for less?
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.820]   And they were showing how to use Google Maps.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.820]   And it's like anybody who's here, I think, knows how to use Google Maps.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.820]   You don't have to waste all that money on paper maps anymore.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.820]   You could do things for less.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.820]   Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.820]   I used to do panels here every year, and then we started doing buzz out loud instead.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.820]   But whenever I was doing the panels, there was always this long explanation
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.820]   from South by Southwest about what makes a good panel, including stay on topic.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.820]   Actually talk about what you described.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.820]   And, you know, they can only do so much.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.820]   They can't force people to do it.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.820]   And it's a big problem.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.820]   People drift from the thing that they thought they wanted to talk about.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.820]   There are also a lot of panels.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.820]   I mean, there are so many options.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.820]   There's 10 panels to choose from.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.820]   That's always bothered me because I have to choose, and I don't necessarily know how to get in beforehand.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.820]   Keep in mind, a lot of people want to do a panel so they get in for free.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.820]   And so it's a big competition to become a panelist.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.820]   And me, I don't want to work, so I don't want to do panels.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.820]   There are also some bad panels.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.820]   And I'm not going to add any specific panels.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.820]   I've been to a couple of panels where it's like it was all I could do to just stay off my iPhone.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.820]   I was at a god-awful panel.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.820]   And some panels end up turning into marketing for a company.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.820]   So you go in thinking that you're going to get information out and you find out learning about,
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.820]   "Oh, this company is not...
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.820]   I don't know.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.820]   Just you just don't want to be there after a while because you're being sold to."
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.820]   I was...
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.820]   I went to the Mark Cuban versus Avner Ronan panel.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.820]   He's the boxy guy.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.820]   And Mark Cuban, of course the guy who started broadcast.com sold it to Yahoo for a billion.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.820]   And it was just... it was so annoying.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.820]   Because...
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.820]   The panel?
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.820]   Yeah, the first thing Mark Cuban says is, "How much money did you make, Avi?"
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.820]   And then, "Well, we don't have a revenue."
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.820]   "Well, I was profitable from day one."
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.820]   And it was just really... it was very annoying.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.820]   What was everyone else getting out of that?
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.820]   Yeah, nothing.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.820]   I was getting nothing.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.820]   But fortunately, the fire alarm went off.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.820]   I'm sure it was an accident.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.820]   I don't know.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.820]   They claim that something went wrong with a water pump,
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.820]   but they evacuated the entire convention center.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.820]   And I'm wondering how many people actually went back to that panel afterwards.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.820]   It was a good excuse to get out.
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.820]   It was a reason to get out.
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.820]   Actually, one of the things that's cooking underneath the surface here is the future of TV.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.820]   We haven't seen a lot of it come out yet.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:32.820]   Like, I was sitting next to the head engineer for Comcast who's building a social TV system
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.820]   where you check in on TV shows and tell your friends, "Hey, I'm watching Lost Room."
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.820]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.820]   And that's coming out in a month or two.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.820]   But there are several of those that are cooking here.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.820]   If you get in the right party or the right dinner, you'll hear about them.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.820]   But they're not out yet.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.820]   It's sort of like four-square last year.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.820]   I kept hearing about this four-square thing, but AT&T last year was down.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.820]   So I couldn't even try it out.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.820]   It came out here last year, right?
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.820]   That's where they released it.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:06.820]   But I didn't have an opportunity to really use it with anybody last year.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.820]   And this year, it's everywhere, right?
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.820]   We just saw last week articles from the awards show saying their ratings are up significantly
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.820]   and they think, "I don't know if this is true.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.820]   This is because of social media because of people tweeting on watching the Grammys
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.820]   and that kind of group tweeting.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.820]   Do you think that's true? Does that make sense?
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.820]   I think so.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.820]   You watch more interest in the Grammys because I was watching people diss them.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.820]   Well, that's the nice thing about something like Twitter is that all of a sudden people
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.820]   start making these references to something funny that just happened and you want to be part of it.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.820]   Yes.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.820]   You can join the conversation.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.820]   I bet it's working for movies too.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.820]   I feel like there's a lot more pressure now.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.820]   If there's a big movie that's coming out that has a lot of geek interest, I feel like
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.820]   I need to see it immediately because otherwise I'm going to be behind the Twitter curve
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   and I'm going to get spoiled.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.820]   It's this whole new level of social peer pressure that I think is definitely -- I'm sure it's
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.820]   helping TV, although I did see then NBC try to congratulate themselves on their time delay
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.820]   by saying that because they had the time delay, social media could sort of pimp the
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.820]   Olympics for them.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   And I was like, no, no, no, no, no, misread.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.820]   In fact, no, yeah, no.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.820]   All the anger was coming from social media about the Olympics.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   That's where it all came from.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.820]   So you're saying the live things are getting bigger ratings, but what about delayed?
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.820]   What about things like lost or -- Well, certainly lost does.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.820]   I mean, I knew -- You've seen ratings bumps on those too.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.820]   I don't know.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.820]   I'm watching 24 because all my friends kept talking about it and it got me interested
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.820]   in the show, right?
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.820]   I wonder if this is the new way, whereas before it used to be the television that the family
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.820]   sat down in front of where you all had this shared experience.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.820]   And now because of social media, when our media is splintering in all these different
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   directions, maybe the social media will start bringing those shared experiences back in.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.820]   I think so.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.820]   AT&T did keep the network up this time.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.820]   I've had no problems.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.820]   It's working.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.820]   This is actually -- It talks about differences between Southwest-West West.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.820]   This is the first Southwest-West where most of the major stuff I want to use is working.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.820]   Remember, the last three years, Twitter has been down every time when we come here.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.820]   Twitter was down yesterday, though, for a while.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.820]   It wasn't down for me.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.820]   It was up and down.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.820]   But it's mostly up.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.820]   Four Square and Go All are both -- I haven't had a single error message on those services.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.820]   And that's remarkable.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.820]   And when Twitter came out here in 2007 -- By the way, it was after your show that got hot.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.820]   Really?
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.820]   So I totally think so.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:38.980]   Because everybody who was coming to Southwest heard about it on your show and started using
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.660]   it, going into the show and started talking about it.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.860]   But it was down all the time.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.460]   I was sitting next to Evan in 2007 going, "Why isn't your service up?"
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.460]   And this year it's up.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.860]   Well, AT&T really staked a lot on it.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.740]   We were talking about this on Buzz Out Loud today.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.140]   They really realized that they could not afford just PR-wise, like another geek apocalypse
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.460]   like they had last year.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:04.460]   You cannot have everybody who's on the cutting edge of smartphone purchasing and being online
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.420]   on a smartphone device talking about how crappy AT&T is.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.620]   So they really doubled down on it.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.620]   And it's paying off.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.620]   They did.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.300]   One of the execs pointed to all the portable towers at one of the parties that was out.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.340]   And they put a lot of portable towers and a lot of brand new antenna technology and brand
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.460]   new software for the network and brand new trunk lines that they brought into the town.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.020]   Well, that's great for PR.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.820]   And it'll keep them from getting some bad press.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.360]   But it doesn't fix the problems elsewhere because they can't bring in portable towers
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.100]   every single place that they have issues.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.100]   True.
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.920]   And in fact, the same executive said, "See those antennas?
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.120]   They're six foot."
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.740]   And in San Francisco, we're only allowed to use two or three foot antennas.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.760]   And we can get six times more capacity on these six foot antennas, but the city doesn't
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.020]   let us put them in.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:54.220]   Said, "You know, the geeks need to help us out and help get cities to put more networking
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.220]   infrastructure."
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.220]   Now they tell us.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.220]   Right?
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.220]   What do I have to talk to?
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.220]   No, really.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.220]   To be a six foot tower.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.220]   I'm really excited.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.660]   To be fair to AT&T.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:09.460]   And I bashed AT&T consistently for a year because every event I go to, this is the first
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.100]   major event that it stayed up.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:17.500]   At CES, I was walking around with three cell phones and only Verizon was up, right?
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:24.860]   The growth in the iPhone and the new smartphone device and the data usage that we all exhibit
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.140]   on these phones is many, many times higher than they ever predicted.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:36.860]   Even Apple, I have a friend who runs the Apple application team, the app team, he says,
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:43.540]   "When we initially pitched it to the execs to add an app store, we thought we would sell
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.580]   X and they've sold 100 times X.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:53.220]   The number of device things that we do with these iPhones is way off the charts for what
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.580]   they were expecting.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.580]   So I tell them a little bit about that.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.580]   True.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.580]   True.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.100]   I mean, there's still our studies that say they're $5 billion behind an infrastructure
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.100]   investment behind Verizon.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.100]   That's what it would cost them just to catch up to Verizon.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.300]   No, that's not true.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.940]   That's not true.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.940]   If you took every iPhone user-
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.940]   I read that on the Internet.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.940]   If you took every-
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.060]   Well, it's not true.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.180]   There's a lot of things on the Internet that you shouldn't believe, yeah?
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.420]   If you took every iPhone user and put them on Verizon, Verizon would go down instantly.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.380]   Verizon's networks could not keep up with iPhone users.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.020]   Is there any truth to what I've read some theories to that the way the iPhone maintains
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.540]   a connection actually exacerbates the issue, particularly for iPhone users?
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.180]   There probably is something to that.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.140]   The usage model of the iPhone is completely- I look.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.780]   I look at how people use phones.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:47.340]   We use data on these things so much more than other phone users.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:54.820]   And by the way, if you talk to Google executives, their stats show that is true even on Google.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.820]   But all the studies say that the data is not AT&T's problem.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.540]   That the voice network is what's so fragile.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.420]   And that's where they haven't invested in the infrastructure the way that Verizon has.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.420]   You're right.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.460]   If you migrated everybody over all the ones to Verizon, they would have problems too.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.700]   When you do it on a tower, I was taken out on a tower.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.180]   There's one fiber optic to the tower.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:18.020]   If you're saturating that link into the tower or whatever, it's gone.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.700]   There's only so many connections that it can keep.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.220]   It's a Wi-Fi problem.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.220]   We have these problems with Wi-Fi at every conference.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.700]   It's expensive and difficult to deal with a lot of people who are all using their devices
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.540]   and all using a lot of data at the same time.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.500]   So is there an app in the way that Four Square won last year or Twitter won in 2007?
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.820]   Was there a killer app?
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.620]   Was Gowalla a killer app for-
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.620]   Gowalla?
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.620]   Interesting.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:49.260]   I've gone from 100 friends on Gowalla to just about 1700 right now and four or five days.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:55.180]   So Gowalla has certainly come on strong, but I have 7,000 friends on Four Square.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:01.100]   So I still think Four Square is the winner right now, but Gowalla sure made a good push
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.100]   this week.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.060]   There wasn't a standout though on South by this year.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.380]   It seemed going in like the idea was that sticky bits might be the thing to make some
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.380]   waves because of the QR codes that could be slapped anywhere.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.140]   You can tag that.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.940]   But it's too much interaction.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.940]   You have to see a QR code.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.940]   You have to walk up.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.940]   You have to launch your app.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.940]   You have to scan it.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.940]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.940]   Already.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.940]   Too many steps already.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.940]   I'm tired.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.620]   Actually, the big fail this year was they just added this QR code to the badges.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.660]   And if you try to use it, the iPhone app works great.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.020]   It recognizes a code instantly, right?
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.100]   But then it asks you to sign in and I can never get it to sign in.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.700]   The service is way too slow and it doesn't work.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.900]   Plus, walk it up to somebody like, oh, hey, do you mind if I scan your badge?
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   You know what?
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.540]   If it had worked, a lot of us have been comparing.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.940]   If it had worked and it was easy to get into, we would have done it.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.940]   But it doesn't work.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.820]   You know what you need is more like a layer, augmented reality browser that you could hold
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.820]   up to somebody's badge and instantly see the information.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:10.060]   Well, tomorrow I'm actually going to be wearing a TV t-shirt with a code on it that is
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.060]   a lot of men.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.060]   I saw that.
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.340]   You did that for the Gilmore again.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.340]   You're so fine with my chest, yeah.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.340]   Yeah, that's bizarre.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.300]   And there's tattoos that do that too.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.620]   All right, well, we're going to do a commercial.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.020]   Maybe we could rotate some people out because there's so many people here we'd like to see.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.780]   Robert Scubble, great to see you.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.860]   So nice to have you here.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.700]   And we'll see you for meat a little later on.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.980]   We'll get you meat drunk.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.980]   Okay.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.980]   Okay.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.460]   Dr. Kiki too, we're going to send you away.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.900]   Can I tell people I'm having you?
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.900]   I have a panel tomorrow.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.900]   Yes.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.900]   What's your panel?
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.540]   I'm going to be here on Open Science.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:46.780]   It's a panel with Ariel Waldman, Natalie Villalobos, Jesse Cohen Sharp from NASA and
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.340]   Tantec Tjellik.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.300]   And we're going to be talking about opening up science, open science, collaborate, cooperate
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   and communicate.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.420]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.420]   It's going to, I think we have a lot of good things to say.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.020]   Yeah, Tantec's panels are always good too.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.340]   Kiki's also the host of This Week in Science, a great radio show for science lovers in our
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.860]   own show on the network, the Twit Network, Dr. Kiki Science Hour, which is every Thursday.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.860]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.860]   On the network.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.860]   Science Thursday is.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.860]   Yeah, it is.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.860]   It's with Maxwell's house.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.340]   Maxwell's house from two to three, Dr. Kiki Science Hour from three to four and coming in
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:23.060]   April, Ros Rose, which we're going to be taking a scientific ecological slant on this year
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.420]   from like 435 to something like that.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.300]   We're at just science Thursdays.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.300]   It's going crazy.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.300]   Science drunk.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.300]   Science drunk.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.300]   That's what it's to do.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.300]   That's the panel I want.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.940]   The science behind drugs, right?
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.940]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.940]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.940]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.940]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:42.940]   Can you study that?
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.940]   You can go talk to her about that.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.940]   Thank you.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.940]   All right.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.940]   Thank you, Kiki.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.940]   Thank you, Robert.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.940]   We're going to invite some more panelists in here.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.180]   You're listening to this week in Tech, a special edition from South by Southwest.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.860]   We want to thank our friends at Citrix for providing the wherewithal to make this happen
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.660]   and invite you to try their Go to Meeting product.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.020]   Citrix, of course, is a very well-known name and enterprise for remote access.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.420]   They practically invented the category.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.460]   Microsoft licensed their technology for remote desktop.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:12.980]   They've made it easy to use, which is where the Go to Meeting product really just shines.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.540]   Imagine that instead of traveling across the country to meet with a client or across
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.700]   town to collaborate with a colleague, you could just fire up the Go to Meeting software.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.740]   Takes about a second to start a meeting.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.620]   You can either set it up ahead of time or even literally while you're on the phone call
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.860]   with somebody, say, "Hey, go to GoToMeeting.com.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.860]   Click the Join a Meeting button.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.860]   Here's the Meeting ID.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.060]   Now, suddenly, they're seeing your computer on their desktop.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.100]   You see your presentation, your spreadsheets.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   You collaborate on documents together.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.500]   I've used it to rehearse speeches.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.060]   It's just really great.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:48.140]   I'm sure panelists here at South by Southwest are using Go to Meeting to plan their panels.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:53.500]   It's the way you can collaborate with anyone, anywhere, without ever leaving your desktop.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.420]   Now you can try it free.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:01.700]   For 30 days, go to GoToMeeting.com/twit and an unlimited 30-day trial offer is waiting
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.700]   there for you.
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.700]   Go to Meeting.com/twit.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.900]   We invite you to try to go to Meeting with Thanks Citrix for their help in making to
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.700]   it possible.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.700]   Jeff Jarvis has joined us.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.700]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.700]   Good to see you.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:15.700]   Good to see you.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.700]   You and Jake were at the dignity.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.700]   Oh, magnificent moment.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   It was the great thing.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.780]   You know, what was raised in Tuleo was that here were two of the kids you really made their
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.620]   careers and you said it was the first time you were on dignity.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.620]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.620]   Right?
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.060]   So that was really kind of a goose bump moment itself and then for you to find a new youth.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.060]   It was fun.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.740]   I don't take credit for Alex, but I do take a little bit of credit for Kevin Rose.
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.940]   His mom and dad came up to me.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.100]   It was really neat.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.460]   And his dad said, I don't remember something like, you know, your son, my son really got
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.260]   his start with you and it was really sweet to see that.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:50.620]   His first screen savers, he had figured out something.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.540]   There was a flaw in Microsoft Windows.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.540]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:59.380]   It was a code that allowed you to broadcast an network message.
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.380]   I am.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.540]   It was not quite I am.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.540]   It was within Windows.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.540]   It was within Microsoft Messenger.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.540]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:11.140]   But he was real nervous and he had a chalkboard and it was like, and you, yeah.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.140]   Boy, I'd love to find.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.140]   That was the first.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.580]   That's the monster you created.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.580]   I'd love to find that and put that on YouTube.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.220]   Oh, what's out there?
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.420]   There is, I think Patrick Norton's first appearance on Call for Help and he's visibly
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.420]   shaking.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.260]   It's actually really kind of cute.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.300]   So Jeff, you were at Dana Boyd's keynote and I thought that was, in fact, there's quite
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.780]   a bit of coverage of it today.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:36.260]   She talked about privacy and the kind of the disconnect between how maybe you and I view
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:41.980]   privacy and how are the younger generation views privacy and whether there is privacy,
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.820]   you can even talk about privacy on the internet.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:49.420]   Well, what she was arguing was that if you look at the continuum from privacy to publicity,
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.300]   that companies come along and make assumptions.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.180]   She was arguing that people want things to be public, which they don't necessarily want
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.180]   to be public.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.740]   And fine.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.620]   And I agree with Dana heartily about this.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.620]   The issue is not privacy.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.100]   The issue is control.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.140]   I need control of my data and what happens to it.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.140]   And that's absolutely true.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:11.460]   But what she didn't talk about that I always wish people like you and Ily or public to
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.660]   a fault didn't talk about the benefits of publicness that we learned from young people
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.660]   today.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.940]   And there's always that edge case.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.940]   There's this horrible case of a young woman who had an abusive father who started her
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.580]   Facebook page and didn't know when she had okay that things were public.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.580]   Okay, that's bad.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.580]   But those are edge cases.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.980]   But those are edge cases and I think that we're letting that rule us in a lowest common
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.980]   denominator.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.980]   Think about this.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.260]   The thing you asked for before the break that thing that's going to let you picture the
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.060]   badge or the person is of course not to plug twig but it's Google goggles.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.780]   And very soon you're going to be able to see this augmented reality where I can see
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.580]   something about all these people out here right just directly from my machine.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.380]   And see people's names superimposed their birth dates.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.060]   They're embarrassing drug and photo.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.780]   They're embarrassing crowd surfing photo.
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.580]   And so that freaks people.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.580]   But what was that?
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.900]   We did a story on Buzz out loud recently about some software that does that.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.900]   You point your phone at someone.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.420]   I mean it's an opt in and they have to be using the software as well.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.780]   You got the they are goggles turned off face recognition but somebody else has done it.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.660]   Yeah and it's possible and it pops up all their social information.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.900]   So is that an argument saying oh my god you've now made something public.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.380]   Well no it's already on the internet it brought it to us easier.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.620]   It's going to freak the public you know the privacy advocates and we end up with this
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.740]   discussion over and over and over again.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.060]   Dana is brilliant and she's quite right about control and she's right to argue that we have
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.460]   to be careful about the implications of what we do and we have to be very careful about
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.540]   educating people about what they're doing.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.340]   Having said that let's have our party.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.340]   Right.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.340]   Let's have our festival.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.100]   Yeah we were talking about this a little today in relation to Netflix who's cancelled
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:51.580]   their contest because of the FTC saying hey you're you know this data can be used to
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.060]   discover things about people that they would rather have private and so because of concerns
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.460]   about their regulation they've pulled the contest and this is just movie information
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.180]   and there are definitely edge cases there right.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:07.540]   But for the most part people probably wouldn't mind having their movie choices made public
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.260]   and in a lawyer's lawyer's lawyer's.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.340]   Well and we were saying that in a world where Facebook exists it's totally bizarre that
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.340]   Netflix would get sued.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.340]   I have.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.940]   You know for maybe revealing how many times you rented like some really crappy movie.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.980]   Like it just doesn't seem like you know relative to the information that that you may
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.380]   not know you're revealing because what this comes down to the control thing it comes down
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.380]   to opt in.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.620]   Well if I am opted into revealing more information than I want to that's not acceptable.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:36.540]   Or if you knew if Netflix knew what they knew today about the power and value of that data
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:41.020]   analyzed by outsiders they would have changed their terms of use long long long ago to say
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.380]   you're opted in and here's a method where you can opt out otherwise this data and area
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.780]   it is ours.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.100]   But they didn't do that probably and so that's where they're stuck now and we're going to
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.340]   see the TOS be the battlefield.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.580]   But isn't the problem with opting people in I mean that's what Facebook does it gets
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.420]   them in trouble all the time and it should be it should be opt in.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:07.140]   You should have the the the spot Facebook is a social thing and if the default becomes
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.060]   people people want to befriend me and they tell but I can't see anything about them.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.740]   That's not very friendly.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.740]   I'm not doing it.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.740]   Sorry no.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.740]   Listen Thropes want to use Facebook too.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.740]   Yes.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.980]   I know I have one.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.340]   You could have a trial period maybe there could be like a preview right like instead
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.740]   of Facebook opting you into showing everyone everything like when they roll out those new
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.820]   privacy features and they roll and if you haven't changed default privacy and they opted
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:34.380]   you into showing all of your photos all of your wall posts all of your information to
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.540]   everyone on the Internet like there was a middle step there could be a preview so that
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.860]   if somebody tries to friend you there's a preview of their basic information maybe who
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.340]   they work for and what that you know because I do often want to know that but I think that
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.740]   there was a way to solve that technologically without opting into without opting in all of
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.460]   the Facebook users to really a remarkable overshare.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:57.580]   Boyd also though pointed out that there's a generational gap in this that Jeff and I
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:04.780]   our generation is everything's private unless we opt into publicity and younger people she
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.300]   said and she's done a lot of studies of this think everything's public but they want to
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.260]   be able to say what's private.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.260]   Right.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.260]   It's the default is different.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.260]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.900]   It's true culture to culture I go to Germany a lot and they're crazy about privacy but then
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:24.020]   I go to a sauna in Germany and it's coed and naked and that's why and they care they care
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.700]   about the privacy of everything is that they're private parts right.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.860]   So the privacy of their private parts doesn't matter right but to us that seems kind of loony
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.300]   but everybody's different in that way and it's hard to come up with structures here but
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.620]   I think that that the risk we have here is that we're going to have this magnificent new
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:44.860]   social connected world and we're going to let these edge cases make a shutdown into our
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.860]   cocoons again.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.460]   That'll be a tragedy I think.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.900]   I think there'll be a middle ground.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.380]   One of the things we're talking about at lunch actually is this idea that South by Southwest
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.220]   knows where you are so we're talking about four square and go all in and that a lot of
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.780]   us that there were three women at the table and we were all saying like yeah I'm totally
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.780]   not comfortable with it.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.700]   Like I don't want to use four square because I'm afraid I'm going to turn out a bunch of
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:09.260]   stuff that I don't know how to turn off and my stance on it is I'm not giving anyone
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.140]   my coordinates unless I need a helicopter to come and rescue me.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.780]   It's just and I think that there is not-
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.780]   That's four square?
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:15.780]   No I don't use it.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.420]   And I think that it's partly we talked about the possibility that to a certain extent there's
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.420]   a gender element too.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.820]   There may be an age element and then there's also a gender element.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.620]   She can't turn too many fields that way.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.820]   She does not want to publicize where she is.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.820]   No.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.620]   How about you Sarah do you feel like that's scary?
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:35.180]   Well I'm just really careful about who you know because it's a two-way street on Go On
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.860]   Four Square, you know people aren't following you, they are on Twitter, you have to be friends
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.860]   jointly.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.940]   You and I both have to decide yes we both want to maybe come to each other's restaurant.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.700]   Sanveria you bothered finding that out I just thought well I'll just say where I am.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.700]   Or that or text.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.700]   I'll just check still.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.260]   So you have to be mutually following to see who you are.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.860]   Yeah so I have to you know I'm just really careful about who I- what I tell myself is
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.780]   whoever I say is my friend on Four Square is somebody that I would like to show up at
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.780]   the bar that I check into.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.780]   Right.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.780]   Good rule.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   You know?
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.940]   Because I'm offering that's what I'm kind of offering.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:12.060]   And I think that's really what the debate about is about which is levels of control.
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.460]   It's not about private versus public it's about how much do you want to make public and to
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.460]   whom.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.460]   Right.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.420]   Because there are certain people that I do want to make it public to and that's what
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.420]   Four Square is about right.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.900]   Do you know you're doing it when you do it.
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.860]   Yeah that's really the big issue.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.860]   Yes.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.060]   Yeah it's something being turned on that you didn't know was turned on.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.920]   Now in defense of Facebook in that switch and I don't know the details very much and my
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.580]   son was talking about it Jake was last night but they were actually giving you more controls
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.580]   when I did that.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.480]   This whole argument that they made everything public to everyone isn't quite-
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:47.060]   Well they gave you more controls but all of the- they made everything more granular
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.620]   and if you had not made any changes to your default privacy settings all of those granular
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.300]   privacy settings defaulted to everyone.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.540]   So things that were previously available only to your friends because that was the default
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.440]   setting suddenly became available to everyone and then a lot of people- I mean believe me
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.760]   I found out a lot of things from people's photos because they don't know that like you've
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.780]   got to change the settings not just for the photos that you upload but also your mobile
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.340]   uploads like those might still be available to everyone.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.340]   That's a separate set.
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.860]   Like this set is a separate setting so the settings are actually so granular now that
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.260]   there's a lot of stuff that you might not even realize is still available to everyone.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.700]   It's interesting because Mark Zuckerberg himself got bit by this when that change happened
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.420]   all of his photos suddenly became public he said all that's no problem except I noticed
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.420]   he pulled quite a few of them back after that.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.420]   No problem.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.840]   He didn't want to end up like the life lock guy.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.080]   Did he get hacked the life lock guy?
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   Oh several times.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   This is my socials.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   Like looking at strangers photos on Facebook is a good way to spend a Friday night.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   That's so sad.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   And it's wrong.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.880]   See if you guys use four square you wouldn't have to be alone.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.920]   Leo what's too far for you?
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.400]   Ah that's a good question I don't know.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.360]   I mean I allowed people to follow my body parts last night at Ignatia.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.100]   I don't know.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.740]   You're probably asking the wrong person exactly.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.740]   We're having fun.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.940]   This is our Twitter special from South by Southwest which has been a really amazing
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.220]   event so far.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:17.420]   He's one of the hosts of our show this week in Google which has heard Saturday afternoons
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.940]   on the Twitter network and of course you can subscribe to that in iTunes.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:26.180]   We actually have a theory that people because it's a Saturday show maybe as many people
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.320]   it's actually very well listened to show but maybe not as many people are listening to
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.120]   it as subscribing to it because it comes out Saturday.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.460]   So we're thinking maybe people have lives.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.460]   They have lives.
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.460]   Maybe we should just push it out Monday instead.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.260]   Anyway we're going to take a look at that.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.200]   I'd love to hear what you think about that.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.760]   Also with a Sarah Lane the great Sarah Lane who is of course a former host of this week
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:51.300]   in fun but a longtime tech TV producer and host on G4 tech TV as well.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.980]   Molly Wood from Buzz Out Loud Tom Merritt from Buzz Out Loud also and Molly's new rant column
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.180]   which is cnet.com/molly-rance.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.180]   I memorize that.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.020]   I know well that's what I do on a Friday night.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.780]   Because that's an annoying URL so thank you.
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.820]   Have you ranted about the URL yet?
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:07.820]   No.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.380]   There might be a good rant.
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.420]   I'm doing actinaxed and then I'll get to the URL.
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.420]   Acta.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.940]   Don't get me started.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:21.340]   One of the other things Dana Boyd said in her speech was that even though Buzz did
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:27.020]   nothing technologically wrong in their launch she said from a technological point of view
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.620]   they was an opt-in thing.
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.140]   They kind of explained what they were doing.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.900]   She said and yet it was quote a complete disaster.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:38.020]   Her point was brilliantly simple which was they mixed the private in the public.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:43.460]   Your expectation on email is that it is private and suddenly not understanding this new paradigm
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.860]   that Google lived under.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.340]   Zap there you are.
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:51.460]   And within Google it was badly tested because within Google public and private are intermingles
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.260]   your company.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.140]   And so it just didn't work for the rest of us at all.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.260]   I think she was very right about that.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.140]   I think that's the for a lot of reasons mixing it with Gmail just messed it up.
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:07.180]   Why did they not bait a Google Buzz when they baited everything else in some cases for years
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.380]   and they just threw this one right out.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.380]   Inside Google.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.380]   Inside Google.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.220]   Which is a huge mistake obviously because Google engineers have different needs than
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.220]   we did.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.820]   And that's the beta process.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.260]   It's also the expectation that we have out here that says oh okay they know it's not
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.260]   done yet.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.620]   All right I can yell about this.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.820]   And that's the problem by not going beta.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.780]   I think it was quite foolish of them not to.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.700]   We're going to take a little bit of a break and come back with more.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.060]   We'll swap some people in.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.060]   Jeff it's been great seeing you.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.060]   Thank you for being here.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.060]   We really appreciate it.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.060]   Come to our meet dinner.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:42.100]   We're going to do you and Jake please come to have snarf with us after the show.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.100]   We're going to have a little party.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.820]   In fact you know I might turn the live streaming rig on for that.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.620]   Yeah I should.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.620]   Meet Cam.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.620]   I want to surf meat.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.620]   Meet Cam.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.620]   Oh wow.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.620]   That's like Austin in a nutshell.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.820]   That's been my experience so far.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.820]   It's meat and booze.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.820]   It's a meat up.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.820]   It's a meat up.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:01.820]   Hey Robert.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.820]   Hey Robert.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.820]   Hey Robert.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.820]   It's a bite up.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.420]   Yeah Robert back.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.220]   Sit down for a second.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.380]   After I do the course I want to ask you about the Chevy Volt because you drove the new
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.380]   electric car from Chevy.
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.380]   Can you talk about that?
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.380]   All right come around.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.420]   We're going to do a commercial for Audible and when we come back Robert will join us
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.420]   also.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:25.380]   Mark Millian is here from the Los Angeles Times and Schwood and he perpetrated a grand hoax
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.260]   last night which apparently was a grand success.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.340]   We'll find out about that in just a little bit before we do though.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.820]   I want to mention our friends at Audible.com.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.660]   A great place to get your audio books.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.220]   In fact I don't even know why they need to advertise.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:41.900]   I think it's the only place to get your audio books anymore at least online but what a great
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.900]   don't say that.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.220]   No they need to advertise.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.020]   They need to advertise more.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.500]   What a great place to go.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:53.020]   Audible saved my life when I had that long commute to Tech TV and now I listen to Audible
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:58.740]   books whenever I'm in the car at the gym, whenever I'm cooking dinner anytime that I
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.100]   need to or would like to read.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.020]   I was just talking to Francine Hardaway yesterday.
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.740]   It was also an Audible fan and she said I had kind of stopped reading because my life
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.940]   was too busy and Audible helped me rediscover books.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.380]   I think that's one of the things Audible does really really well.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.260]   It gets you turned on to reading.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.420]   Now I know that Tom you do a podcast with Veronica called Sword and Laser and I know
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:28.140]   you also whenever you do a book on, it's a book sci-fi book podcast.
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.380]   You do try to look for those books on Audible before you say by the paper version.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.580]   Do you prefer paper or plastic?
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:41.820]   I actually, the thing that I prefer the most is electronic with text to speech.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.780]   You know, you listen to the kid know what is wrong with you.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.300]   Get it, you can't do it.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.620]   Any more that turned it off?
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.180]   Yeah, so you know the thing I like about audiobooks is that you know how much time you
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:55.460]   need to set aside to get the book done because not that it's a burden but when you're doing
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.500]   a book club, you need to get it done at a certain time.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.180]   So it's really good for scheduling.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:06.460]   You're doing The Wind Up Girl right now by Paulo Bache Galupi which is available on Audible.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.060]   And tell me that, what is it?
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:14.900]   It's set in a not too distant future where the main character is a calorie man because
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:19.740]   it's getting harder and harder to grow food and so there's a lot of genetic manipulation
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:25.740]   and copyright battles over the genes that make food and so you know I don't want to
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:30.820]   give too much away before we get into it but yeah it's a great read.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.260]   So I'm listening to Demon right now because on your recommendation and I really am loving
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.260]   it.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.260]   It's even better than I thought.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.260]   I really am digging it.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.260]   It's really good.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:44.660]   A lot of that stuff we're talking about an augmented reality shows up in that.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.580]   Daniel Suarez really obviously is a geek.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:50.780]   In fact, I'm surprised he's not here because he obviously is just into this stuff.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:55.020]   Alright, well let's make The Wind Up Girl our pick of the week from Paulo Bache Galupi.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.020]   It is 19 hours and 34 minutes.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.140]   You're going to get value for dollar there.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:06.700]   That's a long book and you can get it for free by going to audible.com/twit2.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.620]   Actually you can get two books so why don't you get that and Demon.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:12.940]   One of the great things about listening to these books is now you can participate with
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.500]   Sword and Laser and you can join their conversation.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.980]   Is it theswordandlaser.com?
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.980]   Is that?
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.980]   Yeah, the sword.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.420]   Well actually no the Sword and Laser is our email address.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.220]   Swordandlaser.com is the URL.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.260]   Swordandlaser.com.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.180]   And don't go to Swordandlaser.com.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.180]   That's a whole different thing.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.940]   Well, I mean unless you need laser points.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:37.020]   The Wind Up Girl, Paulo Bache Galupi, make that your pick you can get it for free by going
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.180]   to audible.com/twit2.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.980]   Actually when you go there you're going to sign up for the Platinum account which I recommend
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.900]   Francine, I was talking to her she said I sent for the gold account and I wish I'd
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.860]   sign up for the Platinum account because I keep buying more books.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.860]   Get two books a month.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.020]   Really you'll be listening to them.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.460]   I promise you audible.com/twit2.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.020]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.580]   I'm going to add that to my cart right now.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.940]   That's great.
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.980]   So hello there to Mark Million from the Los Angeles Times.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.980]   Great to see you Mark.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.820]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:17.660]   Also to Mr. Brian Brushwood of the scam school show on revision 3 in our own NSFW on the
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.660]   Twitter.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.700]   NSFW is like NSFW Live last night.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.220]   It was awesome last night.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.620]   Look what is that?
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.100]   You have an NSFW sticker or pass?
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.100]   What is that Robert?
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.100]   Stickers.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.940]   Get that microphone in front of your face because I wanted to ask you about the vault.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.940]   You and I drove the vault today.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.940]   The Chevy vault, the new electric car.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.580]   Did you guys drive the vault yet?
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.580]   Anybody?
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.500]   How the hell did they get us up at 7?
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.980]   That's kind of mean Leo.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.820]   Have you ever drive the vault?
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.820]   No, no.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.700]   How the heck did they get us up at 730 in the morning and do that?
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.620]   I was there at 10.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.380]   So it's an electric car which Chevy is going to be delivering.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.660]   The first electric car since the EV won so it's been quite a long time since Detroit's
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.660]   made an electric car.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.260]   I mean Tesla's an electric car but this is a Detroit electric car.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.180]   Well it's not just electric.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:05.140]   It's electric that drives for 40 miles on electricity but once you go over 40 it switches
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.580]   to gas where the gas engine charges the battery.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.580]   It's not a hybrid.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.580]   The gas doesn't power the car.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.380]   It charges the battery so you can keep going.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.820]   So it's kind of an unlimited or a much longer distance.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.220]   They didn't give us a total distance.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.220]   Or maybe they didn't.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.220]   No, if you had 100 miles?
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.220]   You could drive it forever.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.580]   Well you just fill the gas tank.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.580]   Yep.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.020]   Because fear with the electric is getting halfway out.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.020]   Exactly.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.780]   Because it takes a long time for it to charge.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.060]   Do they say how long it takes?
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:34.380]   If you have 120 volt AC it takes about 8 or 9 hours.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.940]   240 which many people do because of their electric dryers and so forth.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:38.940]   It takes about 3 hours.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.220]   And it has some smart technology.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.220]   It had it up for one thing.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.580]   It has an iPhone and a Droid app which I think is very very cool.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.580]   You could drive the car with it.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.580]   You could turn it off.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.580]   No, you could turn it off.
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.820]   Well, it's like that Hummer and Demon.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.820]   You can turn the car on.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.220]   You can get it ready for you because if you're in cold climate.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.220]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.220]   You can get the car warm for you.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.220]   Or here in Texas turn on the AC.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.220]   Turn on the AC.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.300]   Now I think that's going to be a very big thing that people are not thinking about.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.460]   It's nothing to heat a gas vehicle because the engine is generating a ton of heat.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.300]   When you're heating an electric vehicle it's taking it right out of the battery.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.300]   Oh wow.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:20.180]   It even made kind of a point about climate control is kind of an issue on a battery driven
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.180]   car.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.820]   I don't know what it is on the Tesla.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.420]   But I'm sure the Teslas do better in California where you don't have those extremes of heat
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.580]   and cold.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.340]   One of the things they said is we turn the seat heaters on because it turns out that
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.460]   it's much more efficient to heat the seat than to heat the car.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.100]   So they prefer heating the seat.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.940]   They have like gloves built into the...
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.820]   Yeah, that's what you're going to need.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.820]   I think it's great that they're doing it.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:44.820]   It was fun to drive.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:45.820]   It was great.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:46.820]   Lots of torque.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.260]   I got told to slow down in it.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.260]   Did you?
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.220]   Oh yeah, I was squealing the tires around the S-turns and said, "Hey!"
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.860]   They came out and yelled at me actually.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:56.860]   Really?
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.860]   Were you alone?
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.860]   No, there was somebody in the car with me.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:43:59.860]   She didn't care.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.260]   She didn't mind but the other guy.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.660]   And I assumed it was like car and driver test track, you know.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.660]   Awesome.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.220]   We were at a deserted shopping mall.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.340]   That was a little weird because we got in the cab to the shopping mall and the driver
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.340]   said, "Well, it's closed."
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.340]   What's that?
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.540]   Shopping malls closed on Sunday in Texas.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.980]   I thought it'd be the first I've heard of anything.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.980]   That's bizarre.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:19.580]   Anyway, it was a closed down shopping mall and we were in the parking lot there.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.580]   They combed it off.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.860]   That was kind of fun because we could really step on it.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.860]   And it has some good pickup.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.780]   They have a sport mode that gives you better torque.
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.220]   It was a little hesitake.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.220]   Now you drive a Prius.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.220]   A car at the Prius.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.020]   A brand new Prius, a 2010 Prius.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.020]   It's better on pickup than the Prius.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.020]   It's also a little bit quieter because it's only electric for most of the time.
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:40.220]   I never heard the gas engine kick in.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.220]   It's amazing.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.220]   Yeah, it's all like...
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:46.100]   Does it have a little noise maker on the front so you don't run into people?
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.620]   They have a pedestrian mode.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.420]   So it's not quite a horn, but it's a little...
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.420]   You know, kidding.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.180]   Because if you hit the horn, you go, "Whoa!"
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.740]   Dude, I've wanted that for years.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.060]   Like a polite version of the horn.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.060]   That's what it is.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.060]   It's a polite horn.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.140]   And you need a third one to play like kukorach.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.020]   You can mod it to do that.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.020]   The hackers will do.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.020]   When do you need that?
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.540]   You know, how about like ringtone horns that you just load up?
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.540]   Horntone.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.540]   Quick, I'm registering it.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.540]   Horntones.com.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.340]   That was in CES like 2004 or something.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.340]   I remember that.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:25.900]   You know, it's funny because the software is only 65% finished for the car.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.660]   Oh, that's what I want to do is drive a car in beta.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.060]   Well, that's why they had us do it at the shopping mall.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.300]   It's not street legal yet.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.740]   If it hasn't been approved to be driven by a non-employee on the street yet.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.500]   And that's why we had to drive it off in the park a lot.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.220]   But yeah, you know, the hacker, these things are all computer program now.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.220]   Wow.
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.860]   I can't believe somebody has already got horntones.com.
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.860]   Horntones.net and horntones.org.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.860]   It's definitely pornography.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   It's a thing.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.860]   That's horny tones.
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.860]   That's right.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:55.860]   That's right.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.860]   That's a thing.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   Are you a new driver, Prius?
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.140]   Are you worried about sudden acceleration?
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:03.140]   No, you know, I was talking to Guy Kawasaki about this this morning.
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.100]   And you know, let's be real.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.100]   There's been what 50 deaths in 10 years.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.100]   That could be attributed.
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:16.100]   And it's not too, not too, not too, but there is a horntones.com.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.100]   There is a horntones.
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.940]   It says the one and only MP3 enabled vehicle.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.820]   But yes, that is awesome.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.820]   All right.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:28.660]   So there's been 50 deaths, supposedly that could have been caused by some sudden acceleration
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.700]   problems on Toya's over 50s and a lot over the last 10 years.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:33.700]   Oh, okay.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.700]   Only five a year.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.700]   Well, I feel better.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.220]   There's 40,000 people a year who die in cars in the United States.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.460]   This is a statistical anomaly.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.340]   You think this is this year's Summer of the Shark where it's just like they're on the
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.340]   brow, Toya's.
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:52.740]   I think we as humans don't have a good way to measure risk to us.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:53.740]   Yes.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:58.300]   We get scared of flying in a plane, which is thousands of times more safe than driving
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:02.300]   a Toyota to the airport, right?
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:06.020]   And we don't have a good way of, humans don't measure risk.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.740]   That is partly Toya's fault, actually, in this case.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.820]   Because if they had handled it better, it could have just been like a service.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:12.820]   It really did.
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.820]   They sounded like a service.
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.140]   They sounded like they just totally rolled over.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.660]   They just biffed it and they ignored it and they tried to sweep it under the rug and then
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.100]   they ended up having to do a full-scale recall, which is a total of reaction.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.020]   And now that I'm going to do all kinds of recalls on just stupid stuff, but it's really,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.060]   it's their own marketing fault.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.060]   I agree.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.060]   It's a PR problem.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.060]   And I'm not saying you're totally not going to die in your Prius, but they also told you.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.340]   Well, I actually love for other reasons.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:37.660]   I actually love having a Prius now because people get out of my way.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.140]   You could accelerate it in a moment.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.700]   I mean, if you look at this volt, I guess fly-by-wire cars are the future.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.380]   I presume this is all software, this car.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:52.820]   And that's really the hard thing is how do you know that there's a bug or not?
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.580]   You know, Steve Wiesenk and I've been talking about this because we both have the same car
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:01.260]   and he thinks that he has a bug in his car with the cruise control, which you have to
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.540]   turn on, by the way.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:08.620]   And it's always over-ridable and he told me how to reproduce his problem.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.380]   I've tried it more than 500 times.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:14.500]   I can't reproduce it using his own technique to reproduce the bug.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.500]   But it's reproducible.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.740]   Can you reproduce it in his car with you driving?
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.740]   Have you tried that?
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.740]   Oh, really.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:25.180]   And he won't let Toyota look at his car and no journalist has ever filmed him doing it.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:30.860]   And the way you talk with him, because he says it happens at 61, 71 or 81 miles an hour,
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.020]   I know how to switch increments.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.720]   If you tap it up, it increments one mile per hour.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.100]   If you hold it, it increments five miles an hour.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:43.020]   And he also, when you interview him, he says he doesn't look at the right number on the
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.620]   right side, which is the top speed that the cruiser will ever go.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.060]   He says, I can't see that number and I don't care about it.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.100]   Are you accusing this of being a user error type thing?
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.100]   I think there's something--
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.100]   Do we all know what to use or error?
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.100]   Come on.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.580]   Seriously, what does he know about technology?
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:58.580]   Come on.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:03.900]   Sure, because maybe his switch is sticky, maybe his switch has a bug, maybe there is a bug.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.540]   But I haven't been able to reproduce it.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.420]   And I have tried more than 500 times.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.340]   I've put 13,000 miles on my car already since July.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:15.100]   I drive a lot and I drive a lot on Freeway and I use the cruise control 80% of the time.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.420]   I've never had a problem with it.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.220]   You're saying it's PEP-PES, probably.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.220]   PEP-SCAB.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.220]   PEP-SCAB?
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.420]   The problem exists between steering column and bucket seat.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:24.420]   You're just set out of the mind.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.420]   I'll let you go with mine.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.420]   We were both along the same lines here.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   I'm so married.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.420]   Well, I'm married.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.300]   And I don't really blame Woz.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.500]   I don't know if Woz is having really the problem and he's punking the media or whatnot.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.900]   I don't know.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.820]   I assume he's having the problem.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.300]   I believe he won't let anybody else do it.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.460]   But I blame the media for not renting the car and trying it out.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:48.260]   I blame the media for not forcing their way into his car and filming him to have this
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.420]   problem.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.860]   And I blame the media for not understanding the technology that's going on.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.580]   And it's not just the media.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:59.260]   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration doesn't have a single software
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.420]   engineer on their staff.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:05.980]   So how are they able to understand the kinds of complex issues that these cars are going
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.980]   to have?
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:10.220]   My car has radar that follows automatically the car in front of it.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:14.940]   This is all computer controlled and it's the first step along the road to getting a fully
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.980]   automatic car that you just punch in an address and it goes there.
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.100]   I wonder if it's the kind of thing, since there is so much software, I wonder if it's
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.740]   the kind of thing you could go in and just get a flash upgrade to start adding increments
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.260]   that bring us closer to that.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.260]   Flash and cars.
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:32.260]   I think we're close to having user upgradeable cars.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.540]   Actually, we shouldn't have that very soon.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.460]   The Prius we have does have a problem with braking.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.300]   If you have an emergency stop, the brakes feel weird.
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.860]   And people say they've had problems with that.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.100]   They've actually just upgraded the software so that the brakes work differently to make
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.100]   it easier to bring it into the dealer.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.380]   How long until you hook it up to your Wi-Fi?
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.580]   It's the standard plug that gets you into the computer.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.380]   People are hacking Priuses all over the place.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.500]   I just heard my Ford Sync via USB.
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.980]   You could do it.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.900]   I think there's some real nervousness about liability.
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.100]   Talk about PEDCAC.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.380]   I put the wrong BIOS in my car and it drives backwards.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:12.860]   It's not a good idea.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.000]   Ford very cleverly in the last couple of weeks came out with a big press release announcing
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.700]   that they're basically doing both hardware and software firewall in their vehicles so
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.460]   that any kind of corruption that happens to the computer systems that operate the car
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.460]   cannot reach the mechanical portions of the car.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:30.740]   And it was very good timing on their part, like extremely savvy media to say, you know,
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.780]   in the wake of all this Toyota stuff, we're totally locking down our systems.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.820]   But it's also really something that kind of needs to happen.
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.460]   I think it's their corporate bias.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.740]   I asked Allen Malalele if we're going to make an autonomous vehicle.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.460]   He said unequivocally.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.460]   Absolutely not.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.460]   Now why guys?
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.940]   I bet they are going to.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.100]   You can't never is a long time.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:49.100]   Okay.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.300]   I'd say never in 10 years.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.300]   Right.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.300]   That's pretty clear.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.500]   But 100 years from now, give me a break.
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:00.220]   Not even the Volvo V70 is like two iterations away from being a self-driving vehicle.
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.220]   Is that real?
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.140]   I mean, that thing is so there is so much driver control in this car.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.700]   Which is developed by Ford by the way.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.700]   Which is, yeah, exactly.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.900]   There was a Mercedes actually that was demoed in Geneva.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:09.820]   That's the closest thing I've seen yet to auto driving.
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.380]   I mean, it was just the driver controls and that's a remarkable.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:16.140]   The bliss system is your car bliss because the bliss system, that's from Volvo Ford.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.140]   No.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.780]   It's the system that lets you park the car automatically.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:20.780]   I have that.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:26.220]   And it auto detects people on your side and will not just swerve into the lane when there's
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.220]   somebody there.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:31.740]   I have a camera in the Prius that looks at lane markers and if you start going into the
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:36.340]   lane at beeps at you and not just pretensions the seat belts too.
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.460]   Well, that's if you're about to hit somebody.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.860]   Which has happened twice in my car.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:45.140]   If you're about to hit somebody, the radar system says, "Oh shit, my car is going to get
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.140]   wrecked."
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.540]   It refires the brakes.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.180]   It grabs you on the seat belt.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.180]   You feel the seat belt.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.180]   It pre-tensions the seat belts.
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.220]   And that wakes you up and makes you look ahead too.
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.220]   Wow.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.860]   And when you touch the brakes, it really is hypersensitive.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:02.740]   This is one thing that was a major disappointment with the Chevy Volt Leo was that they didn't
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.380]   put these radar systems into that car.
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:10.820]   And if you interview the guys at Ford who built the Taurus 2010 Taurus, it has all these
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:17.980]   systems that use radar to warn you that you're about to hit something or helps you back
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.060]   out of a stall.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:21.820]   It has radar facing sideways.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:27.780]   So if you're backing out of a parking garage and you can't see around a big van or something,
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:34.380]   as you back up, the car has some radar sensors in the back that sense if a car is coming
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.740]   toward you and beeps at you and says, "Stop."
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:42.740]   It's really, really magical stuff that is really safe and it helps avoid up-
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.300]   That's going to be how it happens.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.820]   We're eventually we choose to give up control.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.100]   And it's always going to be optional.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.380]   But we got used to cruise control.
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.020]   We're getting used to radar assist.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.700]   We're getting used to seat belts that hold you down.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.660]   And it's just going to be one thing after another until pretty much it's like, "Ah,
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:57.660]   just flip the switch."
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:58.660]   Just hold me down.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.660]   It'll dries.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.660]   I don't even know if it'll be a flip switch.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.900]   I think we'll just suddenly look around one day and realize, "You know, we're not doing
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.060]   much in this car anymore."
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.060]   Right.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.300]   And you know what hasn't happened lately?
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.300]   People dying.
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.580]   It's like, "To me, it can't happen fast enough."
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.580]   It's like, "We're not good drivers."
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.180]   Because none of your car actually prevents people from tailgating, then they won't run
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.580]   into the back of you if a dog runs in front of the car.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:19.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:21.220]   It's like blowing a frog.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:24.180]   Stories like Toyota set that back in the public mindset though.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.860]   They kind of don't want to put that control back into the hands of a machine.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:32.940]   When people are already unsafe, like we were talking about earlier, unsafe with handing
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.460]   over their life to a faceless but professional pilot of an airplane, they're not going to
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.740]   want to give it to an automobile.
