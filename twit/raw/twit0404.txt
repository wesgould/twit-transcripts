[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.760]   Boy, it's good to have you.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.200]   Tim Stevens, we got him working now.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.840]   Hi, I'm here.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.120]   Yeah, he's up in the cabin, but he's on LTE and no wind
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.960]   storms, so thank you for joining us.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.480]   We appreciate it.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.120]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.920]   Glad to have you back.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.040]   Tim Stevens, the editor-in-chief of Engadget.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.200]   Is that me making that noise?
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.880]   It's back making that noise.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.760]   It's not me.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.680]   No, it's me.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.600]   I fixed it, but it got broken again.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.400]   I can just--
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.120]   No, no.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.360]   Just pop me down.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.640]   I have some chat client that we thought had silence, but
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.800]   apparently is still--
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.200]   And now, of course, everybody in the chat room's going,
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.960]   Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.720]   I haven't muted.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.880]   I haven't muted.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.480]   They want to hear it.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.920]   Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.160]   Also, here, Robert Scobel.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.680]   Hey.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.560]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.520]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.720]   In quotes.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.600]   In quotes.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.280]   Dressed.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.440]   I could take off my clothes if you want.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.960]   No.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.040]   Oddly, it wasn't the first time I'd seen a picture of you
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.520]   in the shower.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.840]   No, there's at least three or four of you.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.360]   And Shell did one.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.400]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.040]   I did one when I worked for Dave Weiner, too.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.240]   So this is a habit.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.520]   It's a habit.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.320]   All right.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.400]   Also, with us, Ryan Shroud from this week in Computer
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.720]   Hardware, editor-in-chief of PC Perspective at PCPer.com.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.920]   Great to have you, Ryan.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.640]   Ryan, you and I are out in the cold, because those of you
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.400]   watching a video probably already noticed.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.000]   Two of the four panelists are wearing glass.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.920]   Well, yeah, I like you trying.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.600]   You guys are glass holes.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.000]   So this is my--
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.240]   No, but you're--
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.320]   My first chance to wear Google Glass.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.440]   So Robert, you got yours as part of the--
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   from Google I/O.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.400]   I was one of the first in line.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.920]   So I had one of seven.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.080]   I have seven, 37.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.680]   I still haven't received my email,
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.040]   so I'm glad to be able to try this.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.920]   And Tim, I saw your extensive review and gadget.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.800]   Really a good review.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.320]   Yeah, it's really--
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.600]   And so you got a review unit.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.400]   No, actually, ours is from I/O as well.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.960]   I was over in the 700s as well, I believe.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   But yeah, that was actually through the previous--
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.720]   Yeah, some of the press people got moved up a little bit.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.280]   I know.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.520]   Since I'm not in the press, I probably
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.880]   shouldn't get any advanced--
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.600]   So you put this thing on.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.800]   OK.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.320]   And what do you see?
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.560]   Now, you wear glasses, Robert.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.040]   So you put it on top of your glasses?
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.760]   You also do, don't you, Tim?
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.600]   Or no?
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   No, I don't have glasses on.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.120]   OK.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.800]   But I don't have that issue.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.000]   We've been doing quite a bit of testing
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.440]   to see what frames are working, what frames don't.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.360]   If you don't have frames that are kind of square,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.440]   that are kind of blocky around the upper edges,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.800]   it'll usually fit pretty well.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.560]   But anything that's got a squarish frame
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   will probably have some issues.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.960]   I actually got my eyes checked and went and got context as well.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.320]   Just-- yeah, I'm wearing context right now.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.600]   So in fact, I'm wearing-- I have what they call
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.640]   "monovision," so my left eye is for reading
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.800]   and my right eye is for distance.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.320]   Should I--
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.200]   That's the right way to have--
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.840]   That's the right way you'd want this for distance.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.760]   If you can see a billboard on the freeway with your right eye,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.200]   you're ready for glass.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.240]   Then this is the one I want.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.440]   OK.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.040]   Now, my friend, like Thomas Hawke, is
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.440]   blind in his right eye and he can't use glass because he can't--
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.760]   They don't make any left-handed glass?
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.280]   No.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.600]   And I thought they were working on one,
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.200]   but they corrected me and said, no, no, no.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.120]   The thing that should be-- I think we should say right
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.000]   upfront is this is a developer preview.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.320]   Google's always said that.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.880]   But people are treating it as if it's a product about to be
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.720]   released.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.200]   Well, eight months from now, maybe.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.200]   It may be 2014.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.360]   I mean, you know, it will be 2014.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.360]   They've said that now.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.120]   They've said that now.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.600]   Instead, it won't be this year.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.880]   Yeah, because Eric said it would be--
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.040]   At first, they were saying it would be this year,
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.240]   but now they're saying not.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.720]   So right now, I'm looking and I don't--
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.520]   there's a piece of plastic in front of my right eye.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.560]   I don't see anything.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.120]   Yeah, it does not--
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.440]   I'm seeing right through it, although it's not exactly clear,
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.400]   but I can see through it.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.920]   Well, when they adjust it, you're not supposed to be working
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   through it.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.000]   You're supposed to look under it?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.360]   So then I'm supposed to look up to look at the--
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.560]   OK.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.440]   And is it off or--
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.240]   It's off right now.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.920]   So that's the first misconception I had about glass
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.160]   was that it would stay on all the time.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.720]   It doesn't.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.160]   It doesn't because it eats battery.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.520]   Any time that projector comes on,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.240]   it's really eating a little bit of battery.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.320]   That's one thing you noted, Tim.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.240]   You guys were reporting about what three and a half hours
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.600]   battery life?
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.360]   We saw about five and kind of let
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.600]   you take pictures of doing some searches.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.120]   If you're doing actual video recording or a lot of that
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.760]   or a lot of hangouts or navigation,
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.640]   you can easily kill this in well under two hours.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.200]   If you're doing solid video recording,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.160]   it's somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes, actually.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.280]   So it's pretty limited at this point.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.960]   But again, like you said, it's just a prototype.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.880]   That's what Scobull said.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.440]   He said, I can kill it.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.280]   And now we're easy.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.800]   While we're talking about the developer edition,
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.880]   the final shipping product will look different than this.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.760]   It'll be snapable to a custom set of frames
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.040]   that they're going to sell.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.840]   So rumor was Warby Parker.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.360]   Is that true?
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.040]   That's a rumor.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.280]   Just a rumor.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.800]   I don't know.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.480]   We should be able to--
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.120]   Robert, you're writing a book about glass.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.960]   Well, I'm writing a book about context, the age of context,
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.080]   which includes wearable computers, glass, and pebble
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.080]   watches and stuff.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.320]   So OK, so how do I turn this on?
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.880]   So there's two ways to turn it on.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.720]   By the way, it's in your peripheral vision always.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.880]   You can't--
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.480]   Even if it's above it, I can kind of see there's something there.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.840]   So there's two ways to turn it on.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.040]   You can just tap the side.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.640]   Because the entire side is a touch sensitive pad, I guess.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.240]   And then you can scroll through.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.760]   All right.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.520]   So now I see--
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.720]   Actually, let me do something.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.880]   Because I can show the audience what you're--
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.600]   What I'm seeing?
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.880]   All right.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.600]   So I'm seeing the time.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.840]   And I'm seeing in quotes OK glass, which is what you're--
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.120]   oh, in fact, I said it.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   And so now it's--
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.040]   Any time you see that story, so let me pull up the screen
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.600]   so people can see what's going on there.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.560]   And now it's saying I can choose from a variety of menus.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.160]   We're going to show you the menu I'm seeing.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.080]   It dims right away.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.320]   It's obviously really trying to save its battery life.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.920]   Let me do it again.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.720]   Let me touch it on the side.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.320]   It doesn't come right on.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.400]   You tap it.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.280]   OK.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.560]   That's what I'm seeing.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.920]   OK glass.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.720]   Actually, tilt it this way so they--
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.640]   I see.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.880]   You can see it.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.600]   Maybe get closer to my head.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.160]   Can I do that?
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.040]   Pull back a little bit.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.120]   It's so convenient, isn't it?
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.120]   OK.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.880]   Well, this is--
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.400]   is this the Glass Explorer app you're running on here?
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.000]   So it's showing what I'm seeing.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.800]   A remix of old sex ed films play.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.600]   I wish it was that good.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.040]   How come I'm seeing--
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.560]   this is in search for that?
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.760]   Yeah, because you said OK glass, and then you said Google.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.840]   And then you said a bunch of stuff
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.320]   that it converted into glass.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.240]   OK, let's try it again.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.880]   So Robert, you actually have--
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.720]   if you can see that box in the corner,
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.840]   can you reach for--
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.280]   Put that there.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   No box.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.640]   It's right there, right there by your hand.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.000]   Your other hand.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.920]   So your my finger is wiggling.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.760]   Right here.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.240]   There you go.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.320]   I'm wearing glass, dude.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.840]   OK.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.480]   Got it.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:27.920]   OK.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.640]   OK glass.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.360]   I'm like, what box?
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.040]   What are you talking about?
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.800]   Take a picture.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.320]   So it does it immediately, and that's the picture it took.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.720]   Now if I were going to-- OK, so now what?
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   So let me just show you the UI first.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.240]   Yeah, what?
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.720]   So yeah.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.880]   Just keep it up here.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.400]   OK.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.040]   I'm pretty good.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.920]   So on this side--
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.440]   So you're just sliding through the stuff.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.640]   On this side, you get to see all the stuff I've done,
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.280]   or emails that have come in.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.040]   Hopefully I don't have any.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.320]   That was an email I just saw.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.240]   Video.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   OK.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.760]   Sorry.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.200]   It went--
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.440]   Temperature and pedaling.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.040]   On this side, there's--
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.200]   This is Google Now card.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.120]   Yeah, so on one side is Google Now cards,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.920]   which includes my stocks, my--
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.160]   There's your calendar.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.120]   Other way.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.400]   There's the Giants game, the Giants one.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.360]   That's good news.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.960]   And there's a picture I just took.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.920]   So that's interesting.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.600]   So now I'm back in the middle, which is the--
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.240]   And that's the cool part of this thing.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.040]   When you-- like when I walked into the airport last Friday,
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.240]   it told me my gate number and my ticket--
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.760]   It knew.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.880]   It knew because it's--
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.160]   Does it pop that up?
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.800]   Or do you have to scroll through it to get it?
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.680]   You just scroll through it.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.840]   It'll chime at you that there's some new information.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.920]   You just scroll through it.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.480]   And it really is useful from that.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.400]   The remote control is laggy, so this
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.280]   is not how it looks in the glass when you're not.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.400]   No, it's pretty responsive.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.440]   Robert, question for you.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.040]   Is this-- how much more useful is this
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.000]   than just having good knowledge on my Android phone,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.880]   where I have the same--
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.960]   Recorded videos.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.840]   Well, for me, it's really useful if you're
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.960]   dragging two suitcases through the airport,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.720]   because you can see something without using your hands.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.880]   And for photography, this is--
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.920]   Mine 10 seconds is the max on the video.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.200]   You can extend it, but--
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.920]   OK, 10 seconds is the max.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.840]   OK, nominal max.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.120]   And then I can play it back by sliding over to it.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.040]   It's recording audio as well as video.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.680]   There's a speaker in the back.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.840]   There's a microphone up here.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.320]   There's a front facing camera, a five megapixel camera.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.560]   We should have Tim talk-- he'd write the review
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.040]   about what's in these things.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well, Tim, throw anything you see.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.320]   So primarily it's a camera.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:34.960]   It's video.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.520]   You get your Google Now card.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.640]   So anybody who's using Android phone
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.800]   will be familiar with that.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.320]   You load apps on the app that I'm using.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.040]   So I have path there.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.680]   So how would I share a picture to path?
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.920]   You just find the picture, tap it, and then choose share.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.400]   OK.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   So find the picture.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.200]   So here's a picture.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.280]   Share.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.320]   Now tap it.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.880]   Tap it again.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.520]   OK, and--
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   Sadly, the voice recognition is limited just
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.640]   to that initial screen.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   You can only say Google Glass do something.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.600]   Everything else you have to do by touch.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.160]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:07.920]   I just shared that.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.640]   Yeah, you did.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.680]   What did I share it to?
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.000]   Probably Google Plus.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.520]   OK.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.040]   Sorry.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.240]   No, that's OK.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.080]   But you can see how easy that was.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.920]   No, but that's why there's--
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.440]   That's why there's so many pictures.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.760]   And it automatically hashtags through Glass.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.760]   So that's why there's so many pictures up on Google Plus,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.960]   primarily from Robert, of just as you walk through.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.040]   I find I take about five times more pictures
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.480]   with this thing on than with my cell phone,
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.920]   particularly with my kids, because I can capture moments
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.840]   that I just couldn't capture with myself.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.280]   Now, isn't this supposed to be that you're not allowed me
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.080]   to use this?
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.360]   No, that's false.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   What are the rules about this?
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.480]   The rules, I can't let them leave my possession.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.000]   So--
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.080]   OK.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.640]   I've let 400 or hundreds of people try them on.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.800]   I was at a concert the other night
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.440]   and I was just swarmed by people.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.080]   There's, by the way, I guess that's now your picture
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.240]   on your Google timeline is of you in the shower.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.520]   Which Miriam took it was not taken with Glass.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.120]   No.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.120]   With her iPhone, yeah.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.440]   Yeah, but of you wearing Glass.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.000]   Oh, so that got shared immediately.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.920]   That video that I just accidentally shared is shared.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.480]   You're on some other mic.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.800]   Hold on, we'll go on.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.000]   Look at that.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.680]   That's pretty cool.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   You guys are all more--
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.080]   Somebody chat--
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.240]   Here's your Google Glass.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.280]   Some of the chat asks if there were any security measures
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.760]   on the device.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.400]   What's that?
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.960]   Or are there any security measures?
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.600]   So basically, anybody can pick this up and put it on
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.120]   and start going through your emails
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.000]   or sharing pictures onto your Google Plus account
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.120]   or path or anything else.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.080]   There's no sort of biometric security or any pin code.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.760]   There was an app released that will add in that sort of thing,
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.120]   but there's certainly nothing built into it.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.800]   The only security that's here right now
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.440]   is the ability to find the location of the device
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.800]   from the my Glass app.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.480]   So if somebody takes it off your face and runs away,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.600]   you can see where the Glass is and you can actually
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.840]   remote disable it as well if you want to.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.920]   But there's nothing to stop somebody from picking this up
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.320]   off your desk and throwing it on their face
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.160]   and taking pictures and posting them online.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.120]   Now, that's why it doesn't leave my face.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.360]   Again, something easily fixed.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.480]   And this is really a developer edition.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.680]   This is not what they expect a consumer edition.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.920]   Yeah, I do use two-factor authentication
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.720]   and I can turn off-- it's hooked up to my Google accounts.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.360]   And I can turn those off instantly.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.000]   If you steal my Glass, I'll be on my iPhone.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.880]   We'll disable it right away.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.880]   Tim, how does it have to connect to the internet somehow?
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.840]   Right, so it's actually kind of interesting how this works.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.440]   So by default, it's going to connect to your phone
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.160]   over Bluetooth tethering, which depending on your carrier
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.760]   may actually cost you more money.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   On Verizon, it's $40 a month extra for me
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.000]   to actually be using Glass through my phone.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.080]   To have that tethering capability.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.120]   Yeah, it appears like a laptop or any other Wi-Fi device
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.680]   or any other Bluetooth data device.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   So if you're on different carriers, the cost may vary.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.640]   But you're almost certainly looking at something additional
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.440]   per month.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.240]   You can also connect over Wi-Fi if you want to directly.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.000]   But at that point, you won't be able to get GPS navigation
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.800]   and you also won't be able to get your text messages
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.240]   on the device.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.800]   But you can still do searches and look up things
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.880]   and take pictures, of course, even with no connection.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.040]   So it's Bluetooth to a phone using done, dial up networking.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.000]   Bluetooth done.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.600]   Or if you're in a Wi-Fi area, does it have its own--
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.800]   it doesn't have its own Wi-Fi built in.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.880]   It's unclear because you have to add--
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.760]   with the Twit network, I had to add it in the app
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.080]   after adding it on my phone.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.040]   So your phone already is on our Wi-Fi network,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.320]   but the app also needed to be on the Wi-Fi network.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.640]   That would imply that maybe the glass itself is doing something
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.520]   with a Wi-Fi network.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.320]   There's a Wi-Fi connectivity from Glass.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.160]   If there's an open network, you can connect to it directly
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.120]   from the headset without having to do anything on your phone.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.640]   Oh, interesting.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.200]   But if there's a password or something funky
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.040]   that you need to enter in, it'll have to go through the app.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.960]   And at that point, it'll get synced up to Glass.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.560]   And then it'll connect that way.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.480]   So that's interesting.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.880]   So if you're in a Wi-Fi open Wi-Fi area or at home
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.920]   or at work where there's Wi-Fi, you just tie it to that.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.200]   You don't have to tie it to your phone.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.840]   You don't have to do any done or anything like that.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.760]   Here you can see Wi-Fi is disconnected here.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.600]   And I got to stress this.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.960]   I know you did in your review, Tim.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.120]   I think people really act as if this is something
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.160]   like a consumer product might be, and it's not.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.840]   No, this is very early days.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.560]   I think Robert and I are both very excited
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.720]   about the potential of Glass.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.400]   I think there's a lot.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.760]   But right now, it's pretty disappointing
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.800]   in terms of the functionality.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.000]   But again, this is very early for developers.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.720]   Google's trying to get these out in the hands of developers
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.320]   before the consumer release again sometime next year.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   But hopefully, they'll be able to do lots of crazy things
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.480]   and apps we've already seen, a bunch of cool apps coming out.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.400]   And there's probably another eight months or so
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.840]   before the commercial release.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.880]   And at that point, I'm sure there's
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.240]   going to be a lot of really exciting stuff.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.480]   So they're asking-- M5 is asking in the chatroom,
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.520]   where does this picture appear to be?
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.240]   You look up, it's above your vision.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.400]   And it's exactly what you would expect, frankly.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.240]   It's likely it will look in a little screen above your eyebrow.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.960]   It's not some magical--
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.880]   we read earlier that was projected into your eyeball
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.240]   and all that.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.400]   No.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.360]   It's like a billboard that's out at distance.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.880]   Yeah, that's--
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.360]   It's like a billboard.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   Generous.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.560]   It's not quite a billboard.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.240]   I think it's a 25-inch display at four feet, something
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.440]   like that is what they say, which sounds about right to me.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.960]   The resolution, though, they haven't qualified,
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.040]   but it sounds like it's 640 by 360.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.640]   Which is less than VGA, which is, again, a little bit lower.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.400]   But ultimately, it looks--
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.160]   I think it looks fine.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.400]   It's not great, but it looks fine.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.240]   It is not necessarily distracting.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.640]   First of all, because it turns itself off.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.160]   And once it's off, you don't--
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.200]   it's just a little thing there.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   And even if your days--
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:22.920]   If your days just disappear--
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.440]   You used to it.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:23.920]   I used to.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.680]   You could drive with it on.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:25.840]   All the time.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.280]   Take a shower with it on.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.480]   Actually, can it get wet?
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.680]   No.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.400]   It's been wet.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.680]   This was in the shower.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.320]   And it works just fine afterwards, right?
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.000]   I had it in the rain today, right?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.160]   So it can get wet.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.000]   It's not recommended that you get it submerged.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.960]   It's not water-proof.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.520]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.040]   It's water-resistant.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.800]   So there's no head gesture here.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.240]   Because I'm thinking of the Saturday Night Live skit
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.800]   from last night.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.840]   You know, there is a head gesture that turned it on, which is--
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.360]   Go ahead, show you how it turned on.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.760]   I studied at 30 degrees, so it comes on right about here.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.600]   Can you show that, Chad?
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.240]   Do you have that there?
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.280]   No, you can set it--
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.360]   Fred Armisen is-- you can set it to any degree
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.880]   between 40 degree and zero.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.000]   I had it at 10 degrees, and I kept coming on
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   and wasting my battery, so I set it to 30,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.400]   so it doesn't come on.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:12.900]   Ah.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.080]   And is that the easiest way, rather than tapping at the temple,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.440]   you want to be able to look up and do that?
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   It is if you're holding something, right?
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.520]   If you're holding groceries coming in the door
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.480]   and your kids are doing something cute, I do this.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.120]   OK, glass, take a picture.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.560]   And boom, you know.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.320]   I think this is pretty accurate.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.960]   There's a compass, too, too, as well,
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.400]   so that you can actually do head tracking as well.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.640]   So there's actually an Easter egg built into glass,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.600]   which you can look at a photo of the team.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.840]   That's a 360 picture.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.880]   You know, you actually turn your head look and look up and down,
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.840]   and it will pan around the photo as if you were standing
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.480]   in the room with a--
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.440]   It's from last night Saturday Night Live, Fred Armisen.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   My phone and now Russell makes their ticket.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.600]   To Google Glass, the phone is up here,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.440]   and I could use it without being rude or distracting.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.040]   And it's simply, you just toggle through the menu like this,
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.080]   and you have to activate it kind of just little--
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.880]   Like this?
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.440]   By the way, it's not glass, but it looks a little bit like glass.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.200]   It's something the prop department built.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.880]   No one knows this.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.360]   It's a little bigger than me.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.920]   I mean, I noticed you're doing it.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.200]   Oh, well, sure, because I told you.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.000]   Now, there we go.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.440]   It's on.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.440]   OK, now to give it a command, all you have to do
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   is say OK glass, OK?
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.680]   Now, what's your Wi-Fi password?
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.040]   Oh, at NBC, it's peacock.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.440]   OK.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.280]   Peacock.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.000]   Peacock.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.560]   Password, peacock.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.080]   Peacock.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.080]   You know, anybody's ever used voice recognition
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.320]   has done this, whether it's glass or your phone
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.040]   or anything else.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.400]   Isn't this great, Seth?
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.160]   No, I wouldn't be able to talk to you like this.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.760]   Especially trying to transcribe emails through glass.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.520]   I found myself repeating myself and speaking very clearly
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.400]   and enunciating just like right as there.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   Peacock.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   Peacock.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   Peacock.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400]   Peacock.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   Peacock.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   And am I?
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   No, I'm not.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   Damn it.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400]   You get the idea.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.400]   We don't have to show the whole thing.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   Do watch it, though.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   It's very funny.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.200]   Here, I'm looking around that panoramic photo.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   You can get a sense.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.800]   Show the screen on his phone.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.200]   It's jittery because of the screen casting.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.200]   But in my glass, it's very, very smooth.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.800]   So this is a photo that you took that's a panorama.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.600]   Oh, this is the Google team that built this.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.520]   It's kind of an Easter egg that they hid beneath the--
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.480]   Oh, this is the Easter egg you're talking about.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   Yeah, yes.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.800]   So that kind of shows the potential for augmented reality within glass.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.840]   I mean, that's the thing that I think people are most excited about
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.840]   and the thing that's really missing in glass right now for me,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.120]   anyway, is any sort of aspect of augmented reality.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.960]   There's nothing in here that really tries to look like it's overlaid
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   over the environment.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.680]   But this certainly shows that the potential is there.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.360]   So I'm curious if you understand.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.920]   Tim, why is this augmented reality?
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.800]   I mean, he's looking at the panorama.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.200]   This isn't augmented reality, but it shows that the potential is there
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.280]   because it can track your head in two axes.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.200]   So it means that it could be doing some overlays over the environment
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.280]   and positioning things in space that you would try to turn your head to sea.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.640]   In other words, that knows what you're looking at.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.080]   Yeah, it knows what direction you're facing, both in terms of x and y axis.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.080]   Maps turn when I turn my head, the map turns in the UI.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.880]   So they are using sensors to do various UILments.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.120]   If you have a long email, you can scroll through it by moving your head like that.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.800]   So.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.000]   OK, Ryan, what do you think?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.560]   You want it?
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.160]   I don't think I want it now.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.400]   It sounds really interesting.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.840]   It sounds like something that I would eventually see myself using.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.080]   But I consider myself kind of on the bleeding edge of technology and gadgets.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.880]   Anyway, I think there's a lot of interface issues that need to be worked out.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.640]   I think the biggest problem is battery life.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.600]   The battery life, you know, the battery life solution, three hours of use is not useful.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.520]   I don't believe the reviews that say three hours of use.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.800]   I get a full day out of it consistently, but I use it like it was designed to be used not
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.000]   as a tech reviewer.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.080]   You would use it.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.760]   The projector, when you keep the projector on, like for video, then the battery goes dead.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.040]   But most of the time you're going to walk around your life and not have this on very
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   much.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.080]   You know, you'll see a notification pop up when you're.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.160]   I'm not going to have it on at all.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.160]   I could tell you right now.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.440]   That's going to give me a headache just from the short amount of time I wore.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.640]   How many years do we give Leo V for you?
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.480]   No, I, you know, somebody in the chat or see our one in the chat room.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.720]   So it's just high tech birth control.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.360]   It's a, you know what?
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   You're surprised.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   Absolutely not true.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.960]   Man, at concerts you should see.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.000]   Tim comes up to me and it's a chick magnet.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.600]   I, I, I, my wife has this lot of off man.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.200]   What do you want to see?
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.400]   Seriously, at the concerts man, there are people are really much more excited about
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.840]   this in the street than the, than the tech director.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.400]   That's your experience to Tim when you walk around people go, Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.680]   I was actually giving a speech yesterday and I was driving down there at the middle of
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.360]   nowhere and I'm staying New York stopped over to buy a drink and the clerk at this gas station
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   in the middle of nowhere.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.960]   An older gentleman I was wearing this goes, Hey, is that Google Glass?
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   Can I try it on?
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.240]   I was shocked that he recognized it.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.040]   So it seems like there's, it's amazing to me the amount of, of perception that there is
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.400]   around this device already, which again, it's not ready for consumer consumption just yet.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.600]   So I know the answer for Robert, but Tim, would you buy this?
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   For $1,500?
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.600]   No, absolutely not.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.440]   Right now, I would definitely wait for the consumer version sometime next year, which
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.840]   hopefully, you know, the cost will be dropped by, you know, two thirds, I would say is a
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.840]   pretty good estimate.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.600]   And of course, the app selection will be much broader.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.560]   I'm predicting these are going to be $200 to $500.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.640]   And I would not be shocked if Larry Page made it $200.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.720]   This thing has nothing in it technology wise that costs a lot of money other than the projector.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.560]   And I've talked to Chinese, the Chinese supply chains, you can buy these projectors for 25
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   to 15.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.440]   The tear down was just a hundred bucks or something.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   There's nothing in here.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.760]   It's a crappy camera.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:44.040]   It's a TI chip with some RAM with a cheap battery.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.880]   There's no cell phone radio in this thing.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.040]   So it should be cheaper than a cell phone in quantities.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.200]   Now they haven't yet able to make a million of these things, but next year, they will
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   be.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.360]   Do you see people gaming with this?
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   Certain kinds of games.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.320]   I'm thinking of Ingress, which is a Google Android game came out of Google.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   That's where I'm going.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.760]   I'm really positive that Google is going to do something like some sort of extension of
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.360]   Ingress at I/O here in a couple of weeks because they're inviting everybody who's going
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.360]   to I/O into Ingress.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.200]   Oh, and I would be surprised to be some I/O integration there.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.160]   Ingress is a game that you play while walking around the world.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.280]   So that kind of game is going to be really interesting here.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.480]   I'd love to play a game where you find power outlets, right?
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.720]   And you get points for finding a power outlet.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.920]   I'd love to go through the Twitch studio and just tag all the power outlets and take
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.000]   a picture and sort of tag you in an indoor positioning map.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.840]   And then other people who need a power outlet, they'll get directed to it, right?
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.840]   That's very interesting.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.280]   That's a good use of it.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:46.120]   Ingress is obviously, it's an interesting game, but it's obviously a Trojan horse for
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.760]   something much more useful.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.320]   Perhaps power outlets, perhaps who knows what.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.680]   But the idea of getting people to play a game that ends up mapping the universe in interesting
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680]   ways.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:01.880]   Now, I was just at SRI this week and SRI is building this kind of stuff for, you know,
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.960]   the military, only they get to play with expensive ones.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   So they showed me a binocular that had two 1080p displays and two 1080p sensors in it
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.440]   and doing complete augmented reality.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.720]   And that I could sit up on the mountaintop and tag buildings.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.440]   You can guess what they're going to use that for in the military.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   Right.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.440]   So many flowers.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.720]   But then they can put virtual actors on the ground, like they put some trucks on the ground
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:33.840]   and they put gunmen who were running through the trees and it was so life like I could
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.840]   not believe it.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.000]   I was shaking them, binocular around and they were staying on the ground like a human
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   would.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.440]   And it was like, wow.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.160]   So think about version three or four of these things.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.320]   Well, I was think of Daniel Suarez, book steaming and freedom TM where people are walking
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.400]   around in the real world, but they're seeing a metaverse overlayed where you see reputation
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.320]   scores and things over people's head.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.720]   This is the kind of hardware you'd need to do that's augmented reality.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.200]   And it's not just, hey, there's a store there with a Yelp square of three stars.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.600]   It's also this person has, you know, does this, I could see a lot of value in general.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.000]   This is why this product and Tim, you might jump in here.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.880]   This product reminds me of the Apple two.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.040]   When I unboxed my Apple two when I was 13 years old, it didn't do anything.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.720]   It had a cassette tape drive.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.360]   How many apps came with the Apple two?
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.720]   I think there was like two apps.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   Basic.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   It was the only one I need.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   Basic.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.840]   And you know, soon you got a couple more.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.000]   It feels like that.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.760]   And it was extremely expensive.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.960]   My dad spent three grand for his two in 1977 dollars, which today would be, I don't know,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.160]   15 grand.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.920]   So this feels like that.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:45.120]   This feels like the beginning of a 20 year journey through wearable computers that we're
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.680]   going to be on together.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:52.320]   You know, some kids at the concert who were going to Berkeley came up and I said, man,
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   this is your future.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   Developed for this.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.080]   This is going to be like your Apple two.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.440]   The Apple two for me changed my life through my entire life, right?
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.720]   And it took 20 years to realize the personal computer to where we understand.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.520]   In fact, when you first encountered them, for most people, it was like, well, this is
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520]   useless.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.520]   This is stupid.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   What would you want this for?
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.480]   But for kids like us, this was something like, wow, I can see what I'm going to use
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   this for.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.760]   So maybe, no, I'll give you that.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.720]   I mean, right now it's a very trivial product that has very limited use.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.960]   It's a little distracting, it's a little weird to wear.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.360]   But I think if they can figure, I think the interface is really the key.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.600]   They got to figure out a way.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.040]   It's too simplistic right now.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.880]   And I understand why they made it simplistic.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.280]   So it's this, you know, virtual strip of cards.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.360]   It's too simplistic because I want some of the augmented reality, some of the gaming
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   stuff.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.960]   And they had real trade-offs.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.160]   First of all, the processors, not all that great here.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.760]   The battery life isn't good.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.960]   It's expensive.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.640]   And humans are freaked out by the same, right?
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:56.360]   So the privacy debates we've had about this and the freakiness debates, they really, I
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.320]   think, constrain the UI to keep it from doing things like live streaming.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.720]   I'm sure that, you know, next year somebody will hack it and make it possible to do that.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.760]   The one thing that really freaks people out that would make it very, very valuable, in
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   fact, it's critical to that idea of reputation score is face recognition.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.760]   That's what it needs to do.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.760]   It should do.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.520]   But it's the last thing they're going to let it do because that's where you really get
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   privacy issues.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   And even with the--
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.120]   But God, that's what you wanted to do.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.560]   I mean, Maryam, when I brought him home, that's her first question was, can I see who my
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.720]   friends are with this thing?
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   Can I do augmented reality?
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   Imagine looking at this audience.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.040]   You're going to have 35 people in our live audience and know everybody's name.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.200]   Know what they all do, where they're from, and to be able to talk to them.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.360]   And that made it first seem creepy.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   But in the long run, really, that's a way to connect.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.160]   That's a way to say, oh, I see you're from Nashville.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   That's cool.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.760]   By the way, we're bootstrapping that world.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.560]   I took a picture of you guys and posted it, and then people were tagging themselves in
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   the picture.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.560]   Oh, really?
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   So within a few minutes--
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.560]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.560]   --on Google+, right?
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   We can all tag each other.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   Yeah, they're collecting that information.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.920]   And so if you see that you're in a picture at something, you can tag yourself.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.400]   And within a few minutes, I could get that information anyways, because you even accepted
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.800]   it, allowed me to see that.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   I don't think it's creepy.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.840]   The people in the chatroom say, oh, that's creepy.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.720]   That's faux relationship.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   It's not.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:17.800]   It's how people converse in group settings when you don't know somebody, you need one
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.920]   point of connection.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.800]   If you're a good host and Robert's standing next to Tim, I'll say, Robert, this is Tim.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.240]   He's the editor, chief at Engadget.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.320]   Robert Scobaldim, you got to know this guy.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.960]   He interviews all the great startups.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.120]   You give them a piece, and now you have something to converse about.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   That's how you create relationship.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.880]   By the way, you can do OK Glass, Google.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   OK Glass.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.720]   Straight out of the Saturday Night Live.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.960]   Google, Leo Laport.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.600]   And so are you looking at now, you're going to look at information about it?
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.880]   But you got to get everybody to shut up around you.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   That's the only problem.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.000]   It's not going to work at parties.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.040]   Leo Laport is there.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.640]   You go again.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.600]   Now, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   Perfect.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.360]   I see no problem with this.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.800]   No, but I think you would agree, Robert.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.000]   I mean, Ryan, that this is...
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.320]   Do you agree with the premise that Robert had that this isn't a way this is the Apple
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   2?
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.720]   It's like, well, what the hell?
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.560]   But can you see the promise here?
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.920]   I definitely do see the promise.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.880]   I love the idea of facial recognition.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.520]   I think there needs to be huge security permissions issues.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.200]   You need to go into the idea of having a single unified source of everybody's identity.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.760]   So Robert doesn't find that information about me that I don't want him to know.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.440]   But the idea of going to a work meeting and forgetting three of the six people's names
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.880]   at your table, but have your Google Glass remind you of that and what projects you worked
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   well with them on previously, is a very powerful thing.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.320]   And it's something that business computing has been trying to do for a while with LinkedIn
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.360]   and all these contact databases and that kind of stuff.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.000]   And I see applications in that regard as well as...
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.960]   And that's why I'm writing a book on context, not just about Google Glass because there's
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.160]   an app called Mind meld that's coming out on the iPad.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.120]   And it listens to you talk like in a business meeting and it can bring stuff on the screen
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.120]   as you talk about it.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.840]   So if we start talking about Apple, it starts bringing information up on the screen.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.000]   Well, and this is what Eric Schmidt was talking about in his speech that Beni thought was
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.960]   "Cookie, if not creepy, about walking down the street and it knows you want pants."
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.040]   And it says, "There's the pants right there that you want."
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.960]   The idea of search knowing before you search what you're looking for, that's where...
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.960]   Do they see that today?
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   That's what Google now is all about?
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.120]   Yeah, that's what now is all about.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.200]   And we're in the very early stages of that, I can see a time where we get over the creepy
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:43.400]   and we start to not only like it, but count on it, where we feel like, "Gosh, why doesn't
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.920]   my computer know what I want before I want it?"
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.240]   The code name for this product was Wingman.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.880]   In other words, they really thought about...
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.880]   I like that.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.480]   Yeah, they thought about the assistive nature of these kinds of plays.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   But can it help you get laid?
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   No comment.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.080]   You might say that.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.560]   Well, only with a certain kind of person.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.960]   Miriam does not let him in the bedroom.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   Really?
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   Except for her shower.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.720]   Miriam, why do you feel about all of this?
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.240]   Do you mind that Robert's wearing these all around all the time?
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.480]   She says she doesn't mind it.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.400]   She figures you'll be bored with him soon enough and then be something else he moved
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   on to say.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.080]   I don't think so.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.760]   This is not a segue where the segue stayed the same.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.000]   There's a new app every two days.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.080]   See, I think you're right.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.800]   I think that's one of the key features.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.720]   It reminded me of the segue at first.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.920]   It's a good idea, but you look like a such a dork using it that nobody's going to ever
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.200]   use it.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.760]   But you're right, this is a platform.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   It's a segue.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.600]   It's segue was not a platform.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   This is a platform.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.920]   Very different way of thinking about things.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.000]   It's also, Mark's a huge change for Google's business model.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.400]   Maybe the other two guys can get involved.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.360]   There's no advertising on here, but there is an affordance for commerce.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.000]   I want to ask it, "Hey, let's go to a Mexican restaurant tonight and take five people."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.480]   I think advertising might be dead.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.280]   I don't know about dead because there still is something about advertising.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.320]   I don't think people like advertising.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.240]   I'm going to interrupt this show in a moment with an ad.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.400]   I think people would far...
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.160]   No, seriously, I think people would far prefer.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.160]   That's what Eric's thinking of.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.240]   We don't need to do advertising as long as we know what you want ahead of time and we
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.240]   could give it to you.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.800]   You're going to say, "Thank you."
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.360]   It's advertising, but it's much more effective.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.160]   Yeah, it's advertising when you know all the background necessary.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.440]   It's what their goal has been with advertising.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   Sure.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.000]   They can't get out of you as possibly can so they can give you targeted ads.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.560]   There's nothing more targeted than a pants ad when you know you need pants.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.640]   Well, this is why I think these are going to be $200 or $300 to start with and go down
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   and press your own.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   You should give them away.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.120]   Well, $200 is giving them away at what they are about costing.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.960]   Think of all the information they're getting.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   They're gathering from the early users.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   No, I'm not.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.000]   But if I'm using these, even with an iPhone...
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.800]   You're feeding Google, you're not using Apple stuff.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.240]   You're not using Facebook stuff.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.040]   You're not using Amazon stuff.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.680]   Now, you are addicted to Google World.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.240]   And that's the interesting question.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   How long before Apple and many other companies are doing something similar?
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.440]   Does Google have an advantage that others cannot compete with?
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   No, I think others are going to...
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.480]   I think you're going to see every company in the world do this.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.040]   Google does have some real deep advantages of knowing what I'm doing.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.080]   They have my Gmail so they can look into that.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.440]   They have my calendar so they know what's coming up on my calendar.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.680]   Apple has all that in your iPhone, though.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.160]   If you give them permission, I took out all the apps on my iPhone and put Google Apps,
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.680]   because the Google Apps are way better.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   What else do they know?
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.480]   They know every search I make.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:41.000]   They know some of my social behavior through Google+, they know some of my buying behavior
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.320]   through other things.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.040]   They know my maps.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.480]   They know where I am right now.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.960]   My Google Latitude, I'll raise shared with my friends that I'm here at Twitch.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.720]   What you really got to work on, I'm sure they know this, is you need a better interface.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.400]   What if you could not wear glasses but just have this piped directly into your brain?
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   Well, that's not why this connected to my office.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.400]   That'll be 20 years.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.400]   If you stay alive 20 years from now, you'll see it.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.400]   I'm working on it.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.040]   I'm going to have more margaritas.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.320]   It's our Cinco de Mayo edition of This Week in Tech with Tim Stevens, Editor-in-Chief of
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   Engadget.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   Nice to have you.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.320]   Tim, wearing his glasses.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.600]   Tim, let me ask you, though, real quickly, before we go to the break.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.600]   You're wearing them now.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   Do you wear them all the time?
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   No.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.760]   I'm struggling for reasons to continue wearing them day to day.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:25.200]   If I'm sitting here at my PC, then it's easier for me to take a call through my PC, easier
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.840]   for me to keep up on emails and everything else through my PC.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.160]   Right now, no, I don't really feel the need to wear them.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.880]   I still am wearing them a bunch just because I'm still going to continue to write about
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.440]   them and to review them as they evolve.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.560]   Ultimately, there's not really a compelling use for me to be wearing them if I'm just
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   standing around in my office.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.600]   It's a review unit for you.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.720]   It's not something you won't live with.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   Right.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.400]   I'm forcing myself to live with it more than I might otherwise, just to make sure that I get
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.080]   the full experience as it were.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.680]   Same thing I felt like with, say, the Pebble Watcher.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.000]   But now I know Robert wears them.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.960]   Well, I wear them at the very moment.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.920]   I'd take them off once in a while.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.560]   I mean, it kind of bothered me after a while.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.760]   It's my optometrist, by the way.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.280]   I had her wear them and she checked out my eye.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.440]   She said, because this screen is at distance, you shouldn't experience eye strain, except
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.720]   that it's above the problem I had.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.120]   The reason you'll have eye strain is interesting.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.160]   Your eye blinks less often when you look up.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.200]   And so she said, "Your eye will just dry out.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.240]   It won't be harmful, but it might make your eyes more."
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   Blink more.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   Blink more.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   Look down a few times.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.760]   And I think that's part of why they don't turn this thing on very often.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.680]   We know from the source code that there will be blinking as one of the gestures, eventually.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.240]   In fact, there's an app already that can--
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.080]   Tim, have you loaded that app?
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.920]   I haven't been able to load it yet.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.440]   No, I haven't yet, myself.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.040]   I haven't really done much hacking with the thing yet.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.760]   No, but I'm eager to try it out.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:53.240]   Also, with us, as you can tell, Robert Scobel, the Scobelizer from Rackspace, and from PCPUR.com,
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.480]   Mr. Ryan Schraut.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.360]   I'm wearing Google Sombrero.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.480]   It's the latest thing.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   See, this I wouldn't mind.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.480]   Google Sombrero.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.280]   It's a new product from Google.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.360]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix who do a great product for anybody
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.880]   in the IT business, go to assist.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.560]   Now see, I can just imagine this.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.640]   Ten years from now, I won't do a go-to-assist ad, but when you're sitting there and your
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.080]   client's going, "I can't get the computer to the boat because the printer is not working
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.000]   and I don't know what the accessory is."
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.680]   You just say, "All right."
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.800]   And Glass will say, "You need to go to assist."
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   You'll install it and you'll be in there and you'll be fixing things.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.880]   Then go to assist now.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   By now, they have 20 modules.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.880]   Right now it's got three great modules.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.840]   They have the remote access, always the best remote access ever for unattended support.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.560]   Up to eight sessions at once.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.720]   You get a full assay of what's on the computer, but now they've got the go-to-assist ticketing
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:54.640]   system, which is fabulous for tracking changes and staging upgrades for keeping track of
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.200]   where there are problems.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.760]   And the monitoring, proactive monitoring, which is fabulous.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.960]   So you know there's a problem long before your client calls you saying, "I don't understand.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   The printer's not working."
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.240]   It's out of toner.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:13.360]   You know ahead of time, toner's low, networks down, Wi-Fi is not working, hard drives full.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.080]   All of this stuff is so great.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:20.040]   Service desk management, monitoring, and of course remote support, making the ultimate
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.320]   in IT tools.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   If you're in the IT or support business, if you're interested in becoming a managed services
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.680]   provider, if you just want to be more effective, if you want to be an IT hero, you've got to

[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.000]   what they can do.

[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.240]   Well, we're having fun with the glass holes here.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.240]   Privacy.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.920]   You've convinced me of my infringed on your privacy.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.920]   No!
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   Because I see you're wearing a big old thing on your head.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.920]   No, that turns on, you can see that.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.920]   Can you?
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.920]   Oh, yeah, I can see it.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   Okay, so on the other side, you can take a little screen.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   Record a video.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   Look at the people.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.080]   If you're not close to it, and if you're not looking right at them, they can't see that
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   the screen is on.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.040]   I've been doing a lot of testing on a lot of people if they can see the display.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.440]   And the way that it reflects, if your head is more than about 20 degrees off of that
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.920]   individual, they won't be able to see it.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.040]   So I can't tell you're reporting now, but I could see it now.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.040]   I could see it now.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.560]   But you have to be looking for that.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.560]   It's not exactly.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.560]   I think they need to put a red light on them.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.760]   Well, if somebody gets to it, somebody's touching it or talking to it, you know, it's
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.120]   certainly obvious you're wearing it.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   The props.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.920]   You're in the bathroom and I start playing with my glass.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.560]   You said in your review you've been in a 10 different or 20 different men's rooms.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.560]   Oh, 60 different men's rooms.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.560]   I always do this though, because that's going to be the new symbol for I'm not videotaping
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.920]   this is you put them up on your head.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.520]   Yeah, because I don't want the perception that I'm videotaping.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.520]   And I don't blame you.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.200]   I don't want to get punched in the face.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.960]   There are people that would.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.000]   Frankly, I'm sure there are.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Yeah, it's probably smart.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   You do the same thing to him.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Do you don't wear him in a men's room, probably.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I have actually I wore him into a few just to kind of see what the reaction would be.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   I have had an eight.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   I'm testing glass.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Don't hit me.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   But I certainly do get a lot of questions.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Are you recording me right now?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.040]   Which shows that there is, you know, there is a concern amongst people and people can't
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.960]   tell whether you are or are not.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   I think there's a lot of this public perception.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.120]   You know, we need to inform people a bit better about what they can and can't do.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.560]   But still, I definitely think the Google needs to do something even if they just made the
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.200]   screen flash red when it's recording.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.480]   I think that would be something a bit more noticeable than what's in there now.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.160]   What's real interesting is I'm now I'm really paying attention to people in bathrooms and
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.160]   what they're doing.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.920]   I've seen so many people doing this in the stalls.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.720]   Everybody with their cell phone.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.720]   And so they don't complain about using a cell phone.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.240]   And by the way, I can record you with this in a lot more choice ways than, you know, if
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.560]   I'm going to do this, you're going to notice, right?
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.960]   If I'm doing that, you're done.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.240]   Now Ryan, you got something a lot of other people want is the Oculus Rift.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.800]   And we have heard a lot of very positive things about this as well.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.440]   This was a Kickstarter project that finally started shipping.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.320]   I'm also on a contributor to that and I haven't gotten my Rift or my glass.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.920]   But it's fine because I have friends who can let me try theirs.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.680]   This is a virtual reality helmet.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.440]   We've seen these before, but this one seems to be the first really to be super fast, super
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.440]   effective.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.440]   You've reviewed it.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.680]   What do you think?
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   You know what?
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.920]   From a technological standpoint, it's really, really impressive.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.360]   It has the fastest head tracking I've seen on any of these types of devices.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   It works very well.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.440]   The setup was super easy.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.240]   No drivers at all as long as the game engine that you're using recognizes it.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.640]   It just works.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.240]   The problems that it has is that right now, this is, again, kind of like the Google Glass,
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.600]   this is a developer kit, right?
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.040]   This is not meant for consumer usage.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.600]   The resolution on the display is very low.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.280]   It's 1280 by 800, which is split between your left and right eyes.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.840]   You're getting 640 by 800 on each eye.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.360]   Not super high res.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.360]   It's not super high res.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.720]   And because those pixels are so close to you, you get this screen door effect that you maybe
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.360]   saw in very old CRTs and that kind of thing where it basically looks like you're looking
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.080]   through a screen window.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.400]   And that's very noticeable right away.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.280]   As soon as you put them on, you know, anybody that does it, that's usually the first thing
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.920]   they comment on.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.360]   And the good thing about that is you play with it for five or ten minutes and you kind
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.320]   of, just like your eyes would adopt, adapt to looking through that screen window at your
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:44.680]   house or something like that, you eventually, your mind kind of blurs that out and you see
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.840]   the image as if it were.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.920]   There's still a low resolution image, but you don't have the black lines necessarily
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.880]   going through it.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.320]   It works really well.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:59.440]   The problem I had personally is that I, after about ten minutes of use in a high speed scenario,
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.320]   like high movement, high speed action, gaming environment, I got motion sickness.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.000]   I didn't get sick anywhere, but I was like, oh, I'm starting to get a headache.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   There were a lot of people who mentioned that.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.360]   But in a slow moving environment, like the demo, the only demo that comes with the Oculus
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.000]   SDK is something called Tuscany.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.640]   You're walking through this little house.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.480]   It's got a little fire in the fireplace.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   Nice view.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.280]   You're walking very slowly though is the key.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.160]   And I don't think that's an accident, right?
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.160]   Well, I didn't get sick as long as it was me controlling it.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.680]   As soon as somebody was driving me around, I was like, yeah, but if I'm looking around
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.480]   or I'm using the arrow keys to slowly move, in other words, the reason people get sick
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.440]   is because their inner ear says they're not moving, but their eyes say they are moving
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.920]   and that this cord causes illness.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.840]   And so your body is trying to make you get sick to get rid of any poison that you may
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.400]   have had in your body and that kind of stuff.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   You're tripping, man.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.400]   You better throw up.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.960]   It's weird.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.040]   The thing I had the most problem with was when you use, like if you're playing Unreal
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:08.560]   Tournament with this and you want to look to the side to target a character or somebody,
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.680]   and you move the mouse in the same direction or the opposite direction, but now you have
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.280]   two, like things are moving at different speeds.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.960]   That's horrible.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:24.040]   My head did not work with that very well, but like there's like a roller coaster type
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.360]   thing, which is basically a castle scene where there's just like a fixed path that you go
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   on.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.760]   When you're not in control of any of the motion, you can just control where you're looking.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.800]   And that wasn't nearly as big a problem.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.880]   So there's, some people are saying that once we get higher resolution screens, some of
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.560]   that will be alleviated.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   The other big--
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.880]   I think the more realistic it is, the worse it's going to be.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.200]   I don't think it's going to be it better.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.960]   I think it's going to get worse.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.160]   Well, we spoke with the Palmer Lucky for Lockless.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.040]   We spoke with Palmer Lucky for Lockless, and he said one of the big issues is the walking
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   speed of these games.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.840]   A lot of these games, like Unreal, you're walking at 20 to 30 miles per hour really fast.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.200]   So your body is completely freaking out because it thinks you're walking this quickly, but
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   of course, there's no motion.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.640]   That happened to me in Bioshock Infinite.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.520]   I stopped running around because I was moving way too fast.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.320]   He says, as games start to adapt to this technology and as game developers know about it, as they're
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.800]   developing the games, things should get much better on the floor.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.080]   The only other technical thing they can change is the input latency.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.400]   There's the latency between when you move your head to when the image, the signal goes
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.520]   away from the sensors into the computer.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.480]   It renders an image, sends it back to the display.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.680]   And that latency is probably in the 20s of milliseconds right now.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.840]   So there's a little bit of delay from when your head moves to when you actually see the
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.480]   result of that.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.840]   And sees the killer in this.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.840]   That's the killer in this.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.280]   And that was why I was impressed with the demo.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.360]   There was virtually no latency.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.960]   You're saying the more complex the environment, the more latency.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   That makes sense.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   Well, sure.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.280]   I mean, like, so you have to wait for the game graphics card to render the image and
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.280]   send it back.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.120]   But if it's a high frame rate, it won't be a problem.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:04.720]   It's literally a latency issue of the sensors in the Oculus and then the software stack because
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   it's going through USB.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.720]   Yeah, it's doing a lot.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.080]   There's some slow things there.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.320]   So they're working on speeding that up for the final consumer version.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.960]   And that should also help alleviate some of the motion sickness type scenarios.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.960]   That was--
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.720]   I mean, I've worn virtual reality helmets from almost 20 years.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.360]   I mean, I've tried them at SIGGRAPH and for years.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.400]   And that's always the issue is latency.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.240]   Even if it's milliseconds between the time you turn your head and the time the picture
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.200]   moves, that's enough.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.480]   What I was impressed with with Oculus Rift is how low they'd gotten.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.680]   It's almost instantaneous.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.640]   And that's why in slow moving environments that latency isn't nearly as apparent as it
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.280]   is in fast moving environments.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   Well, I don't know.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   It's movement, but it's also complexity.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.440]   I mean, if you have 18 guys coming at you and call a duty, that machine is going to
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.040]   be working pretty hard to keep that up to date in real time.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.040]   Yep.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   So--
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.160]   I mean, for a $300 developer kit, it's cool.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.360]   It's a really cool thing to have.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.480]   Like, everybody that comes into the office wants to try it on and give it a shot.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.240]   We kind of judge internally, who has motion sickness and who doesn't?
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.120]   So one of the things I'm trying to do is I'm going to try to teach myself, my body,
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.160]   my mind to understand that there's not an issue.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   But I like--
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:21.120]   Let's use it for 10 minutes every day and see if I can teach myself to get over that
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   motion sickness.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.120]   I don't know.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.960]   I don't have motion sickness in any other facets.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   I fly and all that kind of stuff.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.160]   So you don't get carsick.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.640]   They have these rubber bands that you snap yourself with every time you get seasick and
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.640]   supposed to fix it.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   I don't know.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   I thought about taking dream at me, but I don't think it's the same effect.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:45.120]   So but the reason I think these both are interesting, less innocuous, is that technology is starting
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.240]   to catch up and starting to give us new forms of input.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.640]   Somebody in the chat room said, and I agree that if you could maybe tie this to connect
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:56.120]   or some sort of motion sensor, what an amazing thing.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.240]   It's not just the movement of the head, but the whole movement of the body.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:04.320]   So I think we're seeing some big strides and we're working in the right area.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.800]   The sensors are coming to you.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.080]   There's this company called PrimeSense in Israel.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:14.160]   They made the technology that's in the connect, but the new sensor they showed me at CES is
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.360]   a stick of chewing gum.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.360]   So it's far smaller.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.360]   It's less than $100 and far more accurate.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.480]   They showed it on a projector, down on a desk like this, and it was so sensitive it could
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.440]   tell how hard I was touching the desk.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   It was unbelievable.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.680]   Connect is a good example because it's like the glass.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:34.760]   It was, I mean, Connect was the fastest selling consumer good at the time ever in history.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:39.240]   Everybody snapped it up, but just like the VIC-20 or glass or any of these things, they're
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.280]   early days yet and people go, "Oh, that's it, huh?"
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:47.600]   And they make a decision about how motions, but we can go well beyond now what to connect.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.480]   That was a new experience for us coming soon.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.000]   So we, you know, stayed to expect a new Connect to be coming soon as well.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   What do you know?
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   It's just Xbox.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.440]   Xbox Next will be announced by Microsoft.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.880]   There's a lot of speculation.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.320]   We don't really know anything, but certainly, you know, it's pretty safe bet that there'll
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.760]   be some sort of Connect-like interface included with the device, but at this point, you know,
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.000]   we're still waiting to find out.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.640]   Yeah, it's only a couple of weeks away before Microsoft unveils at the console.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.080]   And I think, you know, learning from the Sony mistake, without actually showing a console,
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.080]   I think it's pretty safe to say.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.160]   Well, actually see some hardware on the 21st.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.480]   Microsoft did delay that.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.920]   It was going to be in April and maybe that's why they delayed it.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.920]   They said, "Hmm, maybe we better show something."
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.920]   Could be.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.560]   Maybe we better have something to show.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.840]   Any predictions, anybody about what we'll see in the next Xbox?
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.040]   I mean, we know what the hardware is going to be.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.520]   It's going to, the computing hardware is going to be almost just like the PS4.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.280]   There'll be a couple of variations.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   AMD.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.120]   It's going to be AMD-based, X86, APU type hardware, right?
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:49.280]   I mean, it's going to create an interesting ecosystem where the bottleneck of development
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.640]   is pretty much going across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.880]   And I think because of that, you'll actually see faster, more robust, you know, improvements
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:04.400]   in gaming, graphics, technology, all that kind of stuff across the board because they
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.560]   don't have to worry about, you know, what target platforms they're going to use, how
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:12.040]   much of a payment bud is going to be to convert from the power PC to the cell processor to
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.840]   the X86 processor, when all those graphics subsystems and that kind of thing.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   So I think they're both of these companies, Sony and Microsoft now understand that the
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:26.120]   hardware will matter much less than the software interface and their services they offer along
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.120]   with it.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.520]   And I think you said the key word because I don't think, I think gaming is, console gaming
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.440]   is kind of a plateaued, it's dead.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.160]   I don't know that it's dead, but I think there's a huge opportunity because you've got a box
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.160]   in the living room.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.760]   When I went to China, all the kids have cell phones, that's all they know about gaming.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.040]   They don't have gaming tablets and cell phones now.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.120]   It's not console or maybe it's PC if you're a hardcore gamer.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.240]   I see the world as mobile.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:56.920]   If the mobile phone has taken a lot of attention away from other platforms, I know I know what
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   I want to have.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.000]   I know what 11 year old who is just as comfortable, I don't see him ever using, actually I take
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.280]   it back, he is a console.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.920]   He moves around fluidly, you have kids too.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:05.920]   Moves around fluidly.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.400]   My 19 year old son's over there.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.960]   iPad is fine.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.400]   Phone is fine.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.600]   Whatever he's got basically.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.160]   He'll play Minecraft on a PC, he'll play Call of Duty on an Xbox, he'll play Minecraft
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.760]   or some other similar game on an iPad.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.280]   It doesn't matter.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.360]   What I don't think is happening is that people are spending a lot of money on consoles and
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.560]   console games which are historically very expensive.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.560]   Not trick.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.200]   If you had to buy one, iPad or Xbox?
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.160]   It's so different.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.160]   You have $400.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.160]   You have $400.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.160]   You have $400.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.560]   Tim, you think people are buying it.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.560]   You said consoles.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.520]   If you had one to choose, it would be an iPad.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   Well, it says more.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.240]   It's certainly a challenge to the console market.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.800]   This one, mobile gaming is of course a huge development.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.720]   A lot of people are happy to just play some sort of game.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.840]   They don't necessarily need the relative complexity of console gaming versus mobile
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.840]   gaming.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.560]   Right now, we're seeing a lot of companies trying to do some crossover gaming where
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.560]   you can play on a console or on your mobile device.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:05.360]   Microsoft is in the best position of anybody at this point to make that work, of course,
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.640]   with Surface devices and other Windows RT and Windows 8 tablet devices and mobile phones,
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.120]   of course, as well.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.800]   So I think that that's also going to be a big part of this is the ability to play games
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.600]   across platforms to pick up where you left off at home.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:23.360]   But of course, whether that helps the Xbox by giving people a better way to take those
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.960]   games home or whether it hurts the Xbox because now those games are going to be playable on
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.720]   Windows phones and tablets, that remains to be seen.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.480]   PC gaming sales have grown the last four years.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.480]   That's my contention.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.640]   If you're a serious gamer, you get a PC.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   Well in consoles, they're down a little bit, but I think that's only because we're at the
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.960]   end of a seven year console cycle.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.120]   Everybody who wants one's got one.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.440]   Casual gaming is not taking away from those hardcore gaming.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.640]   It's a completely additional market.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.680]   So the cell phone and the tablet gaming can't deny it's huge.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.840]   It will be bigger if it's not already than consoles and PCs.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:00.800]   But to automatically assume that because of that, consoles and PC gaming are declining
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.400]   isn't just wrong.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.200]   I mean, we see the sales, right?
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   There's a...
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   I didn't say that.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   I just said it.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   No, I said it.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:15.160]   But compare the numbers, what are the numbers of console games?
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   I don't know.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:22.400]   All I know is when I saw the presentation from AMD talking about the PlayStation 4 and their
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.680]   big deal was, "Okay, here's how it's going to affect us on the PC side as well."
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.000]   They're still showing year over year growth on PC software sales.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.320]   Not on hardware sales, mind you, but on software sales.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.680]   And that console's worth stepping down, but obviously this year and for the next probably
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.040]   at least 24 months, that will go up again as well.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:44.040]   I think the telling thing for me is that we haven't seen a successful console release
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   in a long time.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.960]   The Wii U, I don't think anybody could call it success.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.440]   The PlayStation Vita certainly wasn't a huge success.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.920]   Those are really nice pieces of hardware that in the past gamers would have snapped
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.080]   up, I think.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.080]   That hasn't happened.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:59.160]   So it could be said that a lot of them are waiting for the next PlayStation and waiting
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.160]   for the next Xbox.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.880]   I think that's definitely true.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.960]   But I think the jury is still on whether or not these are going to be as successful
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.400]   as the current generation of consoles.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:10.480]   It's possible that the generation of consoles that we have now will go down as the most
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.200]   successful generation ever.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.720]   I expect there to be lines for the next Xbox.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.240]   I'm sure there will be, but there will be as long as for the last Xbox.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.680]   But will it be for gaming or for gaming plus?
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.280]   Will gaming and media or is that just not an important category?
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.880]   I think TV at home is really interesting.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.160]   The TV world is shifting so fast.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.840]   I just got a new Comcast X1 box and it's all cloud-based.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.360]   The DVR is all cloud-based.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:38.920]   And it shows how the cable system is trying to respond to these new usages.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.840]   Are there any cord cutters here that people have gotten?
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.840]   I bet half our audience.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.320]   You can't get a lot of your inner.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.080]   You have to be a cord cutter.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.480]   Yes, you got it.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:55.960]   So hooking a box up at home that lets us do more of the online videos is going to be
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:56.960]   interesting.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.320]   And if it does gaming, even better.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   Right.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:07.920]   Yeah, I mean, I found some quick numbers where they're talking about 2012 was $18 billion
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:14.200]   in PC sales and they're estimating 21 for 2013 and then 22 billion for 2014.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.840]   It's still going up and console software sales are down a little bit from like 24 to
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.480]   23 to 22 and 2013 is what they're saying.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.160]   I don't think it's not going where.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.240]   I don't think I don't feel like it's getting smaller.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.920]   I feel like it's encompassing more things.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:34.480]   I think the software services that Sony announced at their PlayStation 4 announcement are indicative
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.560]   of how can we maybe have saturated this audience?
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:42.440]   How do we bring in this additional audience or how do we introduce new revenue streams
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.440]   into this audience?
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.200]   I think that's part of the problem.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.320]   You know, the reason where this comes from for me is talking to Nolan Bushnell who really
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.680]   said, I think console gaming is plateaued.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.000]   It's reached the end of the line.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.040]   And partly that's because of tablets.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.480]   But that's tablet is really pretty much casual gaming, right?
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.800]   Yeah, there's some nice.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.600]   There's some nicer driving and first person shooter games.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.600]   Certainly if you're a serious gamer, you're running a PC, right?
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.560]   Yeah, it's already a steam box or a seat.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.360]   So I guess the question is, well, who's buying consoles and why?
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   But I don't know.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.080]   You'd buy a console because you didn't want to configure a PC, just put the game in it
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.160]   plays, you don't have to think about it.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.360]   Out of 100 gamers, how many are those hardcore gamers?
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.360]   20?
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:32.600]   Well, yeah, but that 100 gamers was 30 gamers 10 years ago because the platforms of iPad
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.040]   iPhone, they didn't exist then.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.680]   So what do you do on a next generation Xbox or PlayStation?
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.000]   You play the same types of games.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.040]   You play the same types of games that you do today more advanced.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.600]   You play the same types of games that you can on an iPad and an iPhone, but now you're
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:52.840]   using different accessories like smart glass or the Wii U controller.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.800]   And then you're using Xbox or I'm sorry, using Netflix and using Amazon Prime, using
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.520]   all these other additional services.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:04.520]   I'm not arguing that the console isn't expanding out only from being primarily gaming focused,
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.520]   but I guess I don't understand the argument that console gaming has plateaued.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.520]   I don't know.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.520]   Why is that argument?
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.520]   I study startups.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:18.160]   If you're going to start a startup, what kind of startup would you build if you're going
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.240]   after the gaming market?
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.640]   Would you build an Angry Birds or a Rovio kind of?
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.640]   Well, that's what the…
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   Yeah, you would.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.640]   But that's because of investment, right?
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:30.080]   I don't have the ability to raise the capital necessary to release an Xbox or a PlayStation
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.320]   4 or to build a call of duty, but there are companies out there that do.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.240]   They are, but the new companies…
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:40.160]   The new companies are not going after PC gamers or console gamers.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.040]   They're going after the mobile gamers.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.000]   That's where I'm saying tons of new startups.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Yeah, like the Uvo.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.880]   Maybe it is like somewhat like though…
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.280]   Again, when you go to China, the kids have a cell phone.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.600]   They can only afford one device.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.320]   They're going to put all their resources into the cell phone.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:55.640]   They're not going to buy an Xbox.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:01.120]   Maybe it is a little bit like video or television or movie production where I see console gaming
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:06.320]   as more like a movie studio where you're spending $100 million, $200 million on a blockbuster.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.680]   It's very hit driven.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.400]   If you've got to hit, you make a sequel.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.760]   That's not going to happen on the mobile platforms.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.760]   It's cheap and easy to develop a lot of titles.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.760]   But that's why you see a lot of…
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:20.000]   And those are more like the TV shows, the cheaper stuff.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   That's why on the consoles you see games that come out of EA and the existing companies.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   I study startups.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   I study disruption.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.360]   I study things that happen new.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:34.200]   All of those new companies are aiming at the mobile market or the tablet.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.280]   But it doesn't mean you're not going to have big studios doing $200 million block
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.640]   bluster games like Call of Duty, Episode 5 or whatever.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.960]   Like I said, there's going to be a line for the new Xbox.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.720]   And there's going to be a line for the new $60 halo.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.200]   Those big studios are struggling.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.800]   EA has been struggling a lot lately.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:52.120]   There's been so much consolidation lately as these big studios are buying up the smaller
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   ones.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.240]   And then they're shutting down a lot of the smaller studios that they've picked up.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.160]   Of course, there are certainly…
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.800]   There's a market for big games like Call of Duty's.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.880]   But ultimately those markets are based on huge sales for these consoles.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.640]   And if these consoles can't maintain the source of sales that we saw in the last generation
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.760]   with the Wii and the Xbox 360, then things are going to get pretty dark for the big
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.360]   studios like EA and Ubisoft and others.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.280]   We've seen that in the movie industry over and over again though, that these studios
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.040]   flop, there's a hit streak.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.800]   And it's a hit driven business.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.760]   9 out of 10 movies lose money.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.760]   9 out of 10 games might lose money.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.520]   But when you get that game that suddenly is a huge franchise, then you're rich.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.400]   The jump would give me heck in the…
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.400]   People are giving me heck in the…
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.480]   Sorry, they're giving me heck in the…
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.480]   It's not about China.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   It's about the youth.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:40.760]   You know, Patrick, how many of your friends have Xbox?
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:42.760]   How many of your friends have mobile phones?
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.240]   Every single person in your class has…
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.240]   Has everything.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.080]   Well, mostly mobile phones.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.080]   Everybody has an Xbox.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.080]   I don't have an Xbox.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   Well, you're weird.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   No, I don't play games.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.080]   Well, you're weird.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.080]   I've never heard of it.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   You can count one of them as well.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.080]   Every guy has an Xbox.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.080]   Okay, great.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.080]   You know?
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.080]   People who…
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.080]   Never mind.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.080]   I just spoke at a school in Amsterdam.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.480]   I asked him this question.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:06.000]   How many people play console games that not very many hands went up?
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.800]   How many people have an iPhone?
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.800]   Or a mobile phone?
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.960]   You're asking if you have…
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.720]   Do you have the primary communication device for your generation?
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.480]   Of course, that's going to be 95%.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   Right.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.480]   Everybody's going to have that.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.480]   So if you're a startup…
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.120]   If you play games, you're going to have an Xbox and a Play Stitch.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   If you're going to build a startup to build a new kind of game, are you going to be…
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.120]   Why are you committed?
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.120]   Xbox?
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.640]   Because you're scared because you don't want to have to raise $200 million to make a franchise
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.560]   game that may make nothing.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.360]   And I've seen people, you know, fall…
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.280]   You know, completely fall apart trying to crack the console game market, including some
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.400]   very, very big games.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.640]   But that doesn't mean it's going to go away.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.840]   There's still going to be people making Arnold Schwarzenegger films, and there's still people
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.680]   going to make the next call.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.920]   I didn't say it's going away.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.800]   I just said it's not interesting.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   I agree.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:54.800]   It's not as interesting.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.800]   And that's…
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   I kind of just want to brought it up.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.960]   I'm not forcing you to defend my position because I do think that the hardcore gamers
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:05.920]   might stay with a PC and the casual gamers might do mobile.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.760]   And it makes it a little difficult if you're a console game.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:13.120]   And I think it's one of the reasons consoles are looking at other ways to get in the house,
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.840]   including video and so forth.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.960]   Well, the Xbox is doing the Xbox class or they…
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.440]   You know, trying to tie the mobile into Xbox.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:24.320]   So the kids use the tablets on the couch with the Xbox.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.440]   I think that will be a thing to watch when they announce this new Xbox.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:34.880]   Can they make it a family machine again where people can personalize their video games on
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.840]   their tablets and then play them with the Xbox when they get home?
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.400]   You also have to make it cheap enough.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.640]   If the Xbox is a couple hundred bucks or even now they have a hundred dollar version, then
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.040]   it's kind of like, "Well, you're going to have it, right?
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.560]   Because you want to play that one game."
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.120]   I bought Bioshock Infinite on the PC and on the PlayStation 4.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.320]   I admit that I finished it on the PC though, not the PlayStation 4.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.680]   Because I like that big screen.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.560]   Actually, I have a bigger screen on my PlayStation 4, but I'm farther away.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.920]   You don't have a PlayStation 4, but I'm going to assume…
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   I'll be three.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.920]   I'll be three.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   Did I say four?
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   Yeah, yeah, because I can't say anything.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.920]   Oh crap.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.120]   Let's take a break.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   I'm coming over to your house tonight.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.200]   Let's be honest, if I had a PlayStation 4, what would be so different?
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.200]   You think it would be much different?
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   I don't know.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.280]   Except that it wouldn't play any of the old games.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.640]   How different is it going to be?
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.080]   I played with Aug Man in reality, but no, there's this week.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.080]   Yeah, right now.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.480]   There's going to be a hard time rising from now on.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.000]   How much different could a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox 720 or whatever they call it be?
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.200]   So I posted a story in the show notes about 4K gaming on the PC.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.200]   4K.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.080]   And that is where you get the difference.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.600]   They're fundamentally different experiences, right?
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.160]   Yeah, but where am I getting a 4K on your display?
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.360]   I bought a 4K TV for $12.99.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.360]   Oh, you bought that weird one.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   For the sakey…
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.760]   I saw you setting that up, so what do you think?
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.960]   All right, we're all coming over to your house tonight.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   Exactly.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:08.000]   It's surprisingly good for $1,300, $50 4K TV that I bought three weeks ago.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   It actually…
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   It looks really well.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.160]   I've used it as a desktop PC.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.880]   You can set it up in that way.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.640]   We had to tweak some of the settings out of the box.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:20.560]   It didn't look very good with games, but you turned off denoise and turned down the
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.960]   sharpness and a couple of things.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.720]   And it produced a really great gaming monitor for $1,300, which is about the same price
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:35.040]   of a 30-inch, 2560x1600 display from Dell.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.760]   Just got to get a little bit further away from that.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.840]   So is that going to be what's driving people to consoles as 4K?
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.680]   All the consoles will support it, and depending on how quickly TV manufacturers get that
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.000]   down, I mean, I think Sony has one for $5,000 that's available now.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.200]   This one is obviously a little bit of a different beast.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.960]   It's not something that's at best by something, but it was all in Tiger Direct.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.960]   It's not like a…
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960]   No, no, I know.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.960]   It's not going to be that much.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.960]   And this Nintendo is going to have a 720p console, so that's pretty exciting.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.600]   I'll catch it up.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.600]   Catch it up.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.600]   It's HD.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.560]   No, I'm just…
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.120]   That was a made up story.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120]   I don't even know.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.200]   I don't know if that's true.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.200]   But you know, you're right.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:21.160]   If it could be 4K, or you could use the Oculus Rift with it, or…
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.240]   You can't do that with your iPhone right now.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   I'm nuts.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   They're just very different markets, and I don't think either one of them is going
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240]   away.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.240]   That's my point.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.800]   It's like movies, where you still go to a movie theater and you'll pay $9.50 to watch
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.680]   a big screen movie.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.320]   Not that you don't have a great home theater at home, but there's reasons why you might
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.880]   want to see it in a movie.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:46.200]   You know, it's not like these consoles cost so much that you have to choose, am I going
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.560]   to get a console or an iPad?
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.800]   Patrick's going to get both.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800]   Scott George, my friend.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   I got bad news for you.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.000]   You know, my friend in Sun Valley has three Xboxes with three big screens, and he only
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   plays one game on it.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.400]   A driving simulator is awesome.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.320]   This is Scott Jordan of Scott Evist.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.080]   So wait a minute, now he has 65-inch displays, three of them?
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.240]   And three Xboxes on networked.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.360]   But they're networks, so you're playing the same game on all three?
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.760]   Yeah, it's three separate screens.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   And you're in a…
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.760]   He has one of those rumble seats or something.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.760]   You sit in with the controls and you actually have pedals and stuff.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.680]   It's the ultimate guy room, you know.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.640]   He says, "Let's drive to the grocery store."
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   What do you say?
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   Okay.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   No, it's not.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   We were iced, you know.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.960]   I don't understand driving games because I drive.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960]   I mean, what…
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   When you play that…
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960]   It's something on that system.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960]   It's like…
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   You drive faster.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.440]   You drive faster in a video game, Leo, than in real life.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.440]   It's a whole not an experience.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.800]   A lot less painful, too, I could say.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.320]   We're going to take a break.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.320]   Come back with more.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.840]   We've got a great panel for you, Ryan Shroud, from PC Perspective and the host of This Week
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.560]   in Computer Hardware with Patrick Norton.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.560]   Great show.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.560]   Thursday's, right?
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.560]   Thursday's, yes.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560]   What time?
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560]   Seven.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560]   Six PM.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.560]   Pacific.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.560]   Nine PM Eastern time.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:00.120]   Really, if you want to keep up on the hardware, I used to host that show with you and it was
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   was…
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.440]   So we got somebody who knew what he was talking about Patrick Norton.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.800]   But I'll tune in because I want to know, you know, like, in fact, I'd like to ask
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.080]   you about Haswell because we now have a date.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.440]   Like a bunch of stuff happening with Intel and new CEO.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.000]   We've got HD 5000 graphics.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.360]   We've got Iris.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.400]   So let's talk a little bit of hardware with Ryan Shroud also here.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:26.720]   Robert Scobel, the Scobelizer from Rackspace, the king of internet startups.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.720]   I try to get it right.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.720]   Not just internet startups.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.720]   You got a whole…
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.680]   By the way, everybody wanted to know all the notifications on your phone.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.680]   They saw your phone and it's got all across the top bar on your Android phone.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.320]   It's like 1800 notifications.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.320]   I have a lot of apps.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.320]   You might…
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.960]   I want to clear some of those.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.520]   I try a lot of apps out there.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.360]   Also with his Tim Stevens of Engadget, he gets to try all the news.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:57.360]   So, he's got to try all the other apps out there.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.360]   So, he's got to try all the apps out there.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   And he's got to try all the apps out there.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.360]   And he's got to try all the apps out there.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.360]   And he's got to try all the apps out there.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.360]   And he's got to try all the apps out there.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.360]   And he's got to try all the apps out there.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.360]   And he's got to try all the apps out there.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   I just love it.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.000]   I see Mark Marin has a book now called "Attempting Normal."
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.360]   I got to love Mark Marin.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.800]   The podcast WTF, very funny guy.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.640]   He's got to have a very funny audio book.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.640]   But you can also…
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.880]   So, that's nonfiction, but there's great fiction as well.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.440]   I'm just finished Joe Walton's Among Others, which is a wonderful book about fairies and
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.440]   sci-fi.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:46.720]   Right now, I'm listening to a book about the Hollywood Revolution of the '70s called
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.080]   Pictures at a Revolution that Andy and I co-recommended.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.120]   Just fabulous things.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.240]   For a while, I didn't have time to read or, you know, I try to read in bed and I'd fall
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.480]   asleep after one page.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.160]   And I kind of lost the art of books.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.680]   And I was so glad to rediscover books about 10 years ago when I commuted two hours a day
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.680]   to tech TV.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.720]   Two hours was on a good day, longer in some cases.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.040]   And I'd listen to these books and, you know, I'd love it so much.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.720]   The commu- not only with a commu- go by, but I'd drive around the block a couple of
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.120]   extra times to get to the end of the chapter.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.280]   I was so engrossed in these audiobooks.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.320]   I become a fan and Audible is the way to go.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:26.240]   If you're interested in audiobooks, there's so many great titles to listen to.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.080]   The Iceman, I can't listen to this.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:35.640]   The Iceman, the true story of a cold, blooded killer Bronson Pinchot narrating the story
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.760]   of one of the deadliest killers in American history.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.560]   Yay, yay, yay.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.600]   The Autistic Brain Temple Grandin's new novel or new nonfiction is out.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.120]   The number one download, I guess because of the movie, The Great Gatsby, a lot of people
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.120]   hadn't read that.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.360]   See, that's great.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.880]   Or Norse, no, this is good.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.960]   This is a license plate.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.920]   See if you can figure out what this license plate says.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   N-O-S-4-A-2.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.160]   What do you think that's about?
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.680]   Not for our two.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.680]   Yeah, baby.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.600]   New Joe Hill novel, Kate Mulgrew narrates that.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:14.400]   Best readers, some of the best actors in the world reading great books, fiction, nonfiction,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400]   spoilers, mysteries.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.280]   I'll tell you what, I can get you a couple of free books if you're interested.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:23.240]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you can sign up for the platinum plan that's the two book
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.240]   a month subscription.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.440]   Your first month is free.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.000]   That means your first two books are free.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.920]   Cancel anytime in the first 30 days, pay nothing.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.360]   You'll keep the books forever.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:33.320]   But I think audible's betting and I agree, you'll never cancel.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.920]   Once you become an audible listener, it's audible for life.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.800]   I've been a member for more than 10 years and I love it.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:47.920]   Apple.com/twit2, two books awaits you absolutely free.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.880]   So Intel says June for Haswell, is that something?
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.560]   Let me ask you the basic question, Ryan Shrout, and then we can go from there.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.160]   Is it nuts to buy a computer until Haswell comes out?
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.320]   It seems like it.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:07.720]   If you're going to buy a laptop, probably yes.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:12.000]   Because the main advantage of this architecture is not in CPU performance.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.960]   You'll see a little bit of an increase there, but their main focus is on enabling things
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:24.360]   like connected standby and other battery saving capabilities as opposed to performance improvement
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.360]   capabilities.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.920]   On the desktop side, it won't really be necessary.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.240]   It will have better graphical options.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.280]   That's the HD 5000.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.400]   Yeah, so they have several different brands that they're adding with this.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.800]   They announced the Iris and the Iris Pro.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.720]   These are new names for stuff that we already knew was going to come out.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.600]   It used to be called the GT3 version of their integrated graphics.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.680]   It doubles the amount of computing units inside the graphics pipeline.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:59.400]   Then the Pro version actually adds a large chunk of embedded memory onto the processor
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.600]   itself.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.240]   It's a really interesting thing to have this.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:08.640]   I don't know if I'm allowed to say exactly how much it is, but at least triple digit megabytes
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.480]   of cash on die on the chip with this graphics.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.280]   This is because they've reduced the process size to what?
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   .22 nanometers.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.480]   They've got so much space.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.800]   Yeah, so it's a 22 nanometer chip.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.280]   Ivy Bridge was also a 22 nanometer.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.640]   But what they did, what they were able to do is basically their big problem, their big
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.120]   performance deficit in processors has always been on the graphics side.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:41.760]   If you want to get AMD or Nvidia.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.480]   That's also been a problem for, say, ultra book designs where you have a very limited
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.480]   thermal budget.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.640]   You don't have very much room to put in a heatsink where you would need to cool two
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.440]   independent discrete chips, a processor plus discrete graphics.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.360]   They're responding to customer requests of, "Hey, we want to get that same level of performance
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.880]   or as close as possible out of your single chip."
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:09.280]   And adding in the embedded memory doesn't add that much more to the wattage of power
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.000]   consumption required to add it in.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.400]   So I think we'll find that this upcoming generation of laptops will have much better
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.760]   battery life than they've had before and much better graphical performance than they've
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.640]   had before using those higher end options.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.640]   Is Intel in trouble?
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.960]   They're making billions of dollars a quarter, so I don't think so.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.560]   Their profits are down.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.960]   Yeah, most, a lot of people's were.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.720]   I mean, are we talking about just from what markets they're in?
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.880]   From ARM?
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   The Challenge from ARM?
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.920]   Certainly it's not AMD, but from the Challenge from ARM, the post-PC world.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.640]   So it's not, tomorrow they're going to announce a new architecture.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.280]   And this story is on CNET and several other places on there.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.560]   They're going to announce the first redesign to the Atom chip since it's released in 2008.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.040]   And this is a complete rework.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.400]   It's not, as we've seen over the last five years, take this architecture, tweak it a
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.440]   little bit, let's maybe add hyper-threading and see what else we can get out of it.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.000]   This will be a complete redesign.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.400]   They're taking it from an in-order architecture to an out-of-order architecture.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.440]   It's going to be built on that 22 nanometer process technology.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.600]   It was, this architecture was built for cell phones and tablets.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:29.520]   It was not a repurposed Pentium design that they have brought down in scale.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:35.200]   And what Intel really hopes is, Intel's competition is not really AMD anymore on the CPU front.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:40.560]   It's Qualcomm, it's Samsung, it's all the ARM partners that are dominating that high growth
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.560]   market.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.200]   There is no popular cell phone running Intel at all.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.320]   No, they released Medfield last year.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.800]   And I think there was one in Europe.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.200]   I don't know if they ever released it over here.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.560]   There was a Motorola and Lenovo unit that used it.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.080]   But here's the advantage.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.760]   ARM will still have the maybe a slightly more efficient architecture at its core.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.880]   But the advantage that Intel has over everybody else is that they have their own process technology.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.360]   They do their own manufacturing.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.840]   Nobody else has the expertise at manufacturing that Intel does.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.360]   ARM is a fabulous system.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.200]   ARM is just a spec that others design and create chips based on.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200]   Right.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.600]   So, they go to external foundries like Samsung and TSMC to have those chips made.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.800]   And there may be on 32 nanometer process.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.040]   Maybe they're getting close to 28 nanometer process.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.360]   Intel's running at 22.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.840]   And it's not just 22 nanometer.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.880]   It's a really good 22 nanometer technology.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.400]   And that is their kind of ace in the hole in these kind of battles.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.800]   I haven't tested any actual devices yet.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:49.960]   But from all the information I'm getting, the silver mount architecture that will be released
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:56.960]   or announced tomorrow essentially is going to really put pressure on ARM and its partners
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.600]   to come up with new architectures or new ideas or new products.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.840]   And like I said, I can't verify for 100% without using a phone and seeing what its performance
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.400]   is like and telling you about battery life or something like that.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.720]   But they, this is the time where they are actually taking it seriously.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.600]   Everything else where they've said they were taking it seriously was kind of like they were
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.600]   holding it off.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.600]   They were trying to scale.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:26.600]   It's interesting because Intel isn't just being beaten on the cell phone market by others.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:33.640]   But on the data center, you forget how many computers Google and Amazon and RACIS.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.480]   Aren't they buying x86 Intel chips?
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:42.800]   Mostly, but we're switching over because the power usage on ARM is a lot lower than Intel.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.800]   So if you're building a new data center for Facebook services, what's that?
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.800]   Microservice.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.800]   Microservice.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.080]   And I've met a 17 year old kid at South by Southwest who's building these supercomputers
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.520]   out of ARM chips.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.200]   And it's the ARM chips on the data center.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.360]   So if you're focusing your ARM chips on cell phones, are you going to be able to optimize
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.440]   for both of those markets or both of those?
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.320]   So there's a lot of overlap there, right?
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:14.240]   So the new architecture will have a lot of those enterprise security features that ARM
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.320]   currently lacks.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.600]   Like, you know, a lot of virtualization technology and that kind of stuff that they'll put in
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.600]   this architecture.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.720]   And this architecture will be built for tablets and phones, but it'll also be micro servers.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.880]   And I, Lord, I hope we don't see like any netbook rebuilds based around or something
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.880]   like that.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.920]   But you know, you'll, you may see the smallest clamshell machines may be able to use this
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920]   chip for that.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:42.800]   And Alini did say we're going to see $200 computers based on Intel processors.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.240]   I don't know what that means.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.720]   It's probably based on this, right?
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.680]   Because I mean, this is the lowest cost smallest die that they're going to make.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.560]   Does Intel want to be in this business though?
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.080]   Isn't this a low margin crappy business that they have traditionally as chewed?
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.080]   Yeah, but they're being forced into it.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.000]   I mean, it's the growth market, right?
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.640]   I mean, it's you, you, if you want to grow as a company with shareholders, these are
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.800]   the markets you have to get into.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.560]   You can look at a lot of other stuff that they're trying to do, the, whether they're
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.280]   going to make TV networks and all that kind of stuff as well.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.640]   But it's, it's really all, you know, comes down to this particular market.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.280]   It's, it's kind of, you know, it's, we wish we still had AMD around that AMD was still
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:27.720]   a healthy competitor in the x86 market where they're, their processors were pushing Intel
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.000]   to push forward in that regard.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.680]   I mean, it's kind of a, it's like a depressing sentiment as an enthusiast that we haven't
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:39.480]   had an Intel processor release for over $350 because trust me, they would love to sell
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:44.360]   a $900 processor, but there's no, like there's, there's no performance.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:48.120]   There's no segment for that anymore because nobody has pushed them forward.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.800]   So tough, tough road to hope for them though.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.920]   I mean, it's a race to the bottom.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.800]   It's not a market they are comfortable in.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.800]   It's not quite like the net top era where you were actually selling $200 machines.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.760]   If you're selling a tablet for 600 bucks that is maybe subsidized by Verizon or AT&T, you're
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:05.760]   still going to make money.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.760]   Apple makes their own chips.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.200]   They're able to make money off of that, off of that part as well.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:16.760]   So, you know, they're, they're, they're, they think they need that market and they're,
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.080]   they're really excited about, you know, this, this next step that's going to come out.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.600]   I just, we need to see if it actually delivers.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.200]   They said it delivered every step of the way and it just really hasn't.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:31.480]   And the real proof will be if late this year, if we start to see or at CS next year, we
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.920]   see a dozen Intel based cell phones and tablets, you know, released in that market.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.720]   They're going to keep the atom name.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.960]   Yeah, you know, I don't like that.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.960]   That's a tainted name.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.800]   That's like going back to the Celeron, which they did also.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.960]   I told them that, that the atom name had such a negative connotation, the tech world,
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.120]   they should, because of netbooks.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.400]   I even said, you know, why don't I use the penny of name?
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.840]   Because then you get at least people like my dad who know what the penny him is.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.600]   They got that in the cell phone is they got that in my cell phone.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.480]   I got a penny of cell phone.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.960]   Anything but Adam and I would, I agree with you.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.160]   Adam and they use, they reuse Celeron, which was even worse.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.520]   I don't, I guess they can not, they're out of money and they can't get new trademarks.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520]   I don't know.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.280]   They can't find anybody to do a new name.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.280]   Huh?
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.280]   All right.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:22.920]   So we'll watch, we'll watch with great interest tomorrow, Silvermont will be announced and
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.640]   shipping when?
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.920]   Really late 2013 for some of the components.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.720]   I don't really, it will vary based on the derivation of that architecture.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.080]   So that's, that's the name of the overall architecture.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   And there will be, I think, Baytrails, the name of the chip for tablets and Marifield
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.960]   for cell phones and that kind of stuff.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.160]   Names that we've seen leaked around forever, but didn't really know exactly what they were
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.520]   attached to.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.360]   Interesting.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.960]   It feels like a rear guard action.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:55.160]   It feels like a really challenging market for Intel to try to get into.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.240]   And I understand they have to because if they don't, they're going to be left in the dust
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.760]   in the post PC era, but I don't know.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:03.760]   I'm not.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.240]   Now, tell us about the new CEO.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:11.880]   Paul O'odolini is stepping down and we've got a new CEO, Brian Crazan, Crazanich.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.480]   When is he, when is Crazanich start?
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:15.480]   I don't know.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.200]   I think, I think he actually started already.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.640]   He's already working.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.640]   I think so.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.640]   I think he said blame it on Crazanich.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   16th.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.640]   Okay.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.360]   I think to be completely honest with you, had maybe heard his name once or twice before
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.360]   this.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:35.600]   He's said he comes from the manufacturing side of COO very much like Tim Cook.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.080]   And I know a lot of people in the stories like over in gadget and the versions they were
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.720]   talking about, this kind of doesn't make sense, right?
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.480]   For a company that says they want to change their direction.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.480]   They're wrong.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:52.760]   They want to become a consumer oriented product company, not a chip company that hiring a
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:58.520]   guy whose only background is this process, but making chips like the hard job of actually
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.720]   making the chips is a little confusing.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.080]   And I completely agree with that with that sentiment.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.640]   He's not the big picture guy.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   He's not a vision guy.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.480]   He's a guy who knows how to make chips cheaper.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.160]   I mean, he may be and I and we have no idea, I guess, right?
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:18.840]   But it seems odd to bring in a person who has focused on the manufacturing and process
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:23.040]   technology for so long to somehow guide the company in a direction where they're trying
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.160]   desperately not to be just a chip company anymore.
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.200]   Now, Audelini was not an engineer.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:32.320]   So it's true in a company like this that the engineers like to see an engineer running
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.320]   it.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.320]   Yep.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.320]   They want to see somebody who under speaks the language and understands.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.480]   You tell when you walk through it is a very engineering.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   I have a bunch of these.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.680]   And when you go up to have you ever visited one of their fabs?
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.680]   I know.
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:43.680]   I'd love to see you.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:48.000]   It's like 16 football fields and a huge building and a billion dollar cost.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.680]   You really understand why these fabs are so expensive to build.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.520]   And you understand arms advantage to be a fabulous technology.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.760]   Although somebody's got a fab at Samsung or Qualcomm or somebody's got to build a team.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:03.320]   It's an advantage for arm on their books and it's much less risk for them.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:08.000]   But Intel is hoping they can prove that it's an advantage to be the process leader.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.440]   So maybe that again has something to do with him coming in.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.160]   I think you just nailed it.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   Yeah, you just nailed it.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.080]   They want to bring in third parties to use their manufacturing.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:21.240]   So they want to take this out of market texture and let other people bring in their third party
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.440]   IPs, pair it with their CPU design and maybe make chips that way.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.440]   Right.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.640]   That's something they've announced last year that we're open to letting other people use
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.560]   our manufacturing if we're a part of that licensing deal.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:39.240]   So don't you think the end game, the goal is to get Apple to put our put Intel chips
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.600]   in its arm based iPad and iPhone.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.760]   Isn't that what Intel wants?
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.760]   They already have a great relationship with Apple.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.520]   It's the biggest customer, sure.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:54.720]   I mean, they would love to be in everybody's laptops and cell phones and all that kind
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720]   of stuff as well.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:59.520]   Oh, you get an Apple to rest, you know, Samsung copies and everybody else falls into place.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.520]   Where is AMD?
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.200]   Are they dead?
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.200]   Not yet.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.200]   No, I mean, they're discreet.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.880]   That's actually really good.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:11.880]   They'll have a lot of income from the licensing with Xbox and PlayStation going off the next
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.240]   five to 10 years, at least.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:19.800]   They're going, they kind of announced that CES low cost parts to kind of compete in that
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:23.840]   tablet workspace and they have the advantage of having a really, really good graphics system.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.600]   They're kind of a lagging behind processors stack, but their graphics stack is really,
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.600]   really good.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.720]   So depending on if everybody wants a game on their tablets, like we were talking about
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.200]   earlier, they may make the better chip for that.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.720]   We're actually heading up to Toronto this week to learn all about those new APUs, those
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:45.520]   low power APUs and how they might hope they disrupt the market at least.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.360]   There were rumors that Apple might go arm on its desktop, but I don't think that's going
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.760]   to happen.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.760]   Or is it?
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.760]   I don't know.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.360]   I mean, it could.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.760]   There have been people who have been trying to develop arm-based architecture, arm-based
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.480]   systems that are much higher performance.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:06.640]   I mean, if they're running in the data centers that Robert's talking about and in theory,
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.880]   they could be transferred up to higher performance usage models.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.640]   But you have the same, if the architecture is not developed from the ground up for that
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:17.080]   efficiency model, it's going to suffer.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.000]   Just like when Intel has been trying to take these other architectures and push them down
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.640]   into cell phones and thin tablet market, it just doesn't quite work.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.280]   There's too much that's not made to fit there.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:32.520]   And I think the current, at least the current generations of arm architecture, if you shift
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:36.600]   them up, they become too power and efficient and they're going to lose on the performance.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.640]   And it's battle in their current form, at least.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.160]   We're going to take a break.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:48.080]   Ryan Trapp from PC perspective, Tim Stevens from Engangit, Robert Scobel, the Scobelizer.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.640]   Coming back, we're going to talk a little bit about Apple.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.320]   There's some Apple news.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.600]   But first a word from Citrix, the makers of share file.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.600]   I've said it for years.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.840]   Don't send email attachments as dangerous.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.440]   It's insecure.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.080]   And bounce backs could be a real problem.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.440]   Our files are getting bigger and bigger.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:05.080]   And a lot of email systems won't handle more than a few megabytes.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.080]   It's it.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.800]   It's a bouncy bouncy.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.520]   Share file doesn't is a way to send email attachments without sending email attachments.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:17.920]   A secure way to send files in business by sending a secure link.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.160]   And it works so well.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.840]   It's great too for industries like the medical profession where you've got government regulations
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.840]   like HIPAA.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:25.840]   It is HIPAA compliant.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.160]   In fact, you'll see when you first sign up for share file, you can customize it for
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.360]   up to 30 different industries.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.240]   And of course, when you use share file, you can use it on your desktop, but you can also
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.200]   use it on the go, which is fabulous.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:45.080]   It seamlessly integrates into your daily routine no matter where you are from any device, including
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.240]   a tablet or an iPhone or an Android phone.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:48.320]   I use share file at the time.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:53.320]   So for instance, I'm sending audio to radio stations for the radio show.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:57.360]   Let's say I, and this happens every time, I leave and I forget to send a file to one
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   of the stations.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.520]   They call me and say, where's our file?
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.520]   I've got it on my iPhone.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.760]   I've already synced it to my share file store.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.680]   I can send a message very quickly for my iPhone.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.760]   I don't have to have the file.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.880]   I just connect that to share file.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.240]   And it's boom, it's there.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.440]   They got it.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.000]   You get notifications when the files are opened so you can track progress.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.400]   You can password protect files.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.400]   You could say how long the file is available a day, a week, a month, a year forever.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.160]   You could say how many times it can be downloaded.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.920]   It really changes the way you work.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.720]   I want you to try this free for 30 days.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.720]   Sharefile.com.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.680]   Click the microphone at the top.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.680]   And that's Chad.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:34.160]   This is, don't click that, go right to the top there where it says radio listeners.
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.200]   I know that's confusing, but you know, that's the best that we can do.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.560]   Radio listeners, click that microphone and enter, "Twit," "T-W-I-T."
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.560]   Choose your business and click "Try it."
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.480]   30 days free, I should warn you, you will be hooked.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   Sharefile.com.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.080]   I'm wearing a funny hat because it's Cinco de Mayo.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.000]   Are you going to go have Mexican food after the show?
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000]   Chinese, actually.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   That's right.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   I'm going to Mexico.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.480]   My son said, "No, I've had Mexican too."
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.480]   I've had Mexican.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.640]   He's gone, by the way.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.640]   He's gone.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.360]   Patrick is a local boy, which is great.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.520]   So we can see more of Robert than we really care to.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.400]   Went to school with your son for a while.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.400]   He did.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.760]   Yeah, at McNeere's school, yeah.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.000]   Absolutely.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   And I've known Robert.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   Robert Chattram used to be the moderator of our chat room.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   La Portien.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.680]   He was a La Portien.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.240]   I never told him what the L meant.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.240]   That's not what that means.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.240]   That's not what that means.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.240]   I never told him.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.240]   Back in the KGO radio.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.360]   Back on KGO radio.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.960]   This was '94, '93.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:34.960]   '95.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   Wow.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   Back in the windows, '95 days.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   Things have changed.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   Imagine.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.920]   Can you imagine in '95 what you would have thought you'd be sitting here would be streaming
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.840]   a television show, High Def on the internet, and you'd be wearing those things in your
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840]   eyes.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840]   The Google Glass.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.760]   I mean, we dreamed about some of this.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.720]   I remember we were playing with CUC.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:53.720]   We were happy to see you.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.720]   See you see me.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.720]   Remember that?
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.720]   We were happy to get a few frames with the chat room.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.720]   You know, there would be like 18 people on our TV.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.720]   And look at this.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:02.720]   I mean, Ryan Shrout.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.720]   He's got a television studio in Tennessee.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.640]   Looks like, pardon me?
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.640]   Tim Taki.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.640]   Oh, whatever.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.640]   Some state.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:11.640]   Close.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.640]   Hey, when we...
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.640]   Close.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.640]   In '95, we were happy to get...
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.800]   '94, we were happy to get a little, tiny video with three frames and so on.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.800]   Look at how he's High Def.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.920]   Tim Stevens is in New York state, right?
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:20.920]   Am I wrong?
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.920]   Are you in Vermont?
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:22.920]   Correct.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:23.920]   Okay.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:24.920]   I'm in New York and I'm casting LGE.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.760]   No physical data going into my building and I still have high definition.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:29.760]   That's amazing.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.760]   You're using cell networks.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:33.760]   All because there's no wind blowing in the trees around.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.160]   You have to figure that part out.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.840]   When the wind blows, it doesn't work.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.160]   But other than that, it's great.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.800]   It's really amazing.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.800]   There's no connection.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.960]   What's going to be like in 20 years?
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.200]   Well, I won't be here.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.960]   I don't know.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.440]   I'll be retired or dead.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.480]   Everybody's going to be wearing oculus, rifts, glasses, and we're just going to...
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.640]   You know where you can see this stuff happen is at the Maker Faire.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:55.640]   You love...
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.640]   I love it.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.640]   I love it.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.640]   I'm so cool.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.640]   They're all over the country now.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.640]   We went to one in Detroit, New York with the original Maker Faire.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:06.000]   It's coming back here to the Bay Area at the San Mateo event center May 18th and 19th.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.480]   It's a weekend.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.960]   And if you'd like to go to Maker Faire, these are going to go very fast.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:15.440]   I want to give you a pair of tickets.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.000]   The 8th annual.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.560]   8th annual Bay Area Maker Faire is coming.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:27.400]   It's a family festival, family friendly festival of invention, creativity and resourcefulness.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.480]   It's really great for kids.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.560]   They have wonderful things for kids.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:34.520]   You want your kids to learn how to do this stuff too because I think it's just important
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.840]   for them to understand how this stuff is made.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:44.040]   You can go to Maker Faire, M-A-K-E-R-F-A-I-R-E.com for more information to purchase tickets or win
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:50.360]   a pair of adult day passes, good for either day by emailing marketing at twit.tv.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.320]   Would your name and mailing address and we'll choose winners at random on May 8th and notify
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.400]   you then?
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:56.400]   So I don't know how much.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.200]   I think we have 20 passes, something like that.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.200]   That's cool.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.200]   I wanted to give them a plug.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.200]   Let's see TechShop.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.200]   An unpaid at.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.200]   TechShop?
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.200]   Yeah, they usually have a big area.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:09.240]   TechShop's a worker space here in San Francisco and I love these hackerspaces.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.240]   They're so...
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.240]   Yeah, they do great stuff.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.240]   TechShop's one of the best.
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.240]   And that's where Square started out.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.240]   It printed its little device.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.440]   You're kidding, really?
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.440]   Wow.
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.640]   Yeah, so they have 3D printers.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:23.560]   They have all sorts of milling machines and band saws and all sorts of fun stuff.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:26.280]   And there's lots of companies that meet up there and build stuff there.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280]   It's really great.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.440]   Email, marketing at twit.tv for your passes.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:33.680]   We'll give away some number that we don't even know what they are, but some number at
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.680]   random.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:40.240]   And if you don't get one for free by May 8th, go to Maker Faire with an E on it at theend.com.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.760]   Tom Merritt is here to tell us what's ahead this week on Twit.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.400]   Hey Leo, here's a look at some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   on Tech News today.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:53.760]   Tuesday, May 7th as the Wired Business Conference also EA announces their earnings.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:57.800]   Wednesday, May 8th will get earnings from AOL and Groupon.
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.800]   Friday, May 10th.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.760]   LG's Optimus G Pro is coming to the US as an AT&T exclusive for $200.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.600]   And Jack Ma is supposed to step down as CEO of Alibaba.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.960]   All that more on Tech News today this week.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:11.960]   Back to you.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:18.560]   Everybody through Friday, 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern times 1700 UTC on Twit.tv with
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:24.760]   Tom and Sarah and I as it's a great way to keep up on your Tech News each and every day.
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:32.360]   Microsoft says, according to the IDC, actually the IDC says Microsoft shipped 900,000 surface
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.560]   tablets in the first quarter.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.560]   That's about six weeks.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.560]   That's not bad.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:42.360]   Surprisingly, they're planning, now this is maybe a little less.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.960]   Including all surface, the surface.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.040]   Yeah, pro and RT, although I think RT is like this much of the 900,000.
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.800]   I don't think anybody bought RT.
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.600]   It's certainly not what bomber was expecting.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.040]   Really he thought RT would be the hit.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:58.880]   No, I think he was expecting Windows 8 to sell a lot more than what it is.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.880]   It's a nightmare.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.880]   It's a nightmare.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.760]   Eris here says there's no value in making a Windows RT tablet today.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.360]   They're waiting for the second gen.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:11.160]   Microsoft apparently planning a next gen surface announcement next month, which is awfully soon.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:14.560]   That's like seven months after the surface sold.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.560]   It's a challenge.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.680]   If you're a PC maker, it's a challenging business right now.
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:21.800]   How many iPads sell a quarter right now?
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.280]   They sold last quarter.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.280]   What was it?
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.280]   30 some million?
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.280]   Something?
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.280]   So it's 30 to one.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.080]   Yeah, that's about right.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:34.360]   Well, I don't think the surface is the only Windows operating system that's being sold.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:38.240]   No, but it's 15 to one right now if you're comparing tablets, right?
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.240]   Right.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.240]   Well, no, there's other tablets.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.240]   I don't know what it is.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.240]   You're right.
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.240]   It's something like that.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.240]   It ain't good.
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.080]   You can see this when you fly.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.600]   All you see is iPads and kindles.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.600]   You don't see very...
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.160]   Boy, if you see a surface, it's a rare bird, isn't it?
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.560]   I saw one in a Panera down the street.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:55.560]   Does that count?
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.560]   Yes.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.560]   That does.
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:58.560]   It's just prized.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.360]   I saw a surface at a Panera.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.560]   I had to look twice to make sure, but it was a surface pro.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.520]   It was the one real work on it and everything.
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.360]   At least somebody's doing some good marketing.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.760]   I'm not crazy about the surface ads, but you've seen the Nokia ad...
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.240]   ...are in the serenity and joy of this beautiful day as we come together to celebrate the
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:17.240]   commitment.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:21.800]   I want to point out that the groom's side is all on iOS.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.720]   The bride's side is all on Android.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.200]   I just want to mention that just so you know, you know.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.760]   Enormous phone?
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.680]   You mean the enormously awesome galaxy?
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:34.200]   But...search one-trick pony.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.880]   Aren't you a little young to have an iPhone?
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.040]   You want to go?
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.880]   I sheep, copy bots.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.520]   Auto-correct this!
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:52.880]   So...is there an app for this?
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:53.880]   This is a pretty good app.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.880]   I got a set.
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.880]   That's great.
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.440]   I don't know if it makes me buy a Nokia phone, but I like it.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.880]   You guys search using Siri.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:00.880]   Search karate.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:01.880]   Search karate.
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:02.880]   You think they knew about the Nokia...
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.120]   And then you got the Waitrons, okay?
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.000]   And they're standing in the middle and they both have Windows phones.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.400]   Very colorful.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.680]   One red, one yellow.
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.600]   And this is the dialogue I like.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.240]   You think they knew about the Nokia Lumia that stopped fighting all those times?
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.240]   I don't know.
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.080]   I think they kind of like fighting.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:22.880]   I think they kind of like fighting.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:23.880]   I think they're right.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.800]   That doesn't mean you're going to use a...
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:30.440]   It says, "Don't fight switch to a Windows phone."
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:33.000]   That's a really poor reason for me to switch.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.160]   It's not selling features and benefits, I admit.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.800]   It didn't tell me anything about their product, but just, "Hey, don't be like them.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.800]   Buy my thing."
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.800]   Like that's...
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.360]   I mean, it's funny, but I don't take it.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.560]   Not all they got, I got to tell you.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.760]   I bet if you showed that to the average person, didn't already know what a Nokia Lumia was,
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.800]   they would not have remembered the words "Noki Illumia" after watching this.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.600]   It's not where Microsoft spent a lot of money or Nokia spent a lot of money.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.800]   I've been watching this great show with Don Cheetel on Showtime.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.200]   It's called House of Lies.
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:06.200]   It's about marketing these business consultants, these management consultants.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:10.240]   For some reason, everybody in the show is using a Lumia 920.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.240]   Every single person in the show.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.240]   And they take a look.
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:15.040]   What a strange thing.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.680]   I guess everybody in New York uses Lumia's, right?
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:18.680]   Totally true.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.400]   Every time I see it's amazing how many Lumia's there are in New York City every time I'm
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.400]   there.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:28.600]   And they also get these really gratuitous moments where they show the user interface up close.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.760]   It's like you didn't get a big enough budget to shoot this show.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.600]   You had to sell this too.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.520]   They did that most research.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.600]   There was iPhones and iPads everywhere.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.440]   There's one scene with, I think, four iPads and three or four iPhones on one desk at one
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.440]   time in House of Cards.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.040]   It's the product placement.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:50.280]   I understand people need to make money and commercial advertising is a challenging thing
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.280]   these days.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.680]   Christmas getting a little overwhelming, I think, right now.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:58.480]   We'll be glad to use Lumia's if Microsoft pays us a ton of or Nokia.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:34:59.720]   I wouldn't do it.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.920]   I couldn't do it.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:01.920]   I like it.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:02.920]   It's a nice phone, but absolutely.
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:08.720]   So I've been using the Galaxy S. There's the House of Cards with everybody's got an
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.720]   iPhone.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.840]   The best scene is where Kevin Spacey takes the reporter's iPhone and plucks it in the
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:14.840]   glass of water.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.000]   Kind of give me chills.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.240]   I've been there.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:22.320]   And then says, "Don't worry, I'll get you two more."
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.320]   Wow.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:26.680]   I didn't realize there was that much Mac stuff.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.320]   Oh, there's a Canon camera.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:30.720]   He plays for PlayStation 3 game.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:32.120]   He plays, I think, Call of Duty at some point.
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:35.320]   He also talks about the PlayStation Vita and how he needs to get one for when he's in
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.320]   the car too, which definitely stood out.
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.320]   Oh, that was weird.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.320]   You're right.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320]   Because here's this guy.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320]   He's supposed to be the house whip.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.520]   He's like 100 years old.
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:45.920]   And what did he do for relaxation?
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.120]   He goes in the basement and plays Call of Duty.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.120]   I don't think so.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:54.200]   This is what happens when we don't want advertising between our shows anymore.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.600]   Yeah, really folks.
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.800]   The content becomes the end.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:58.800]   And that's what's going to happen.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.160]   It's a shame for a lot of content.
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.560]   I mean, I'm paying for that content.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.840]   And back in the old days, you know, that no commercials know nothing.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.920]   But still I'm paying for content that's still an easy to read it as.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.120]   At least, you know, they don't break it.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.520]   I mean, it's not a minute off from the content.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.120]   You got to pay for this somehow.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:20.760]   So I've been playing with the HTC One and the Galaxy S4.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.120]   And these are the hot phones.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.400]   I would say there are three Android phones that are the top ones.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:28.720]   The Nexus 4 is still in there because it's inexpensive and it's a pure Google experience.
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:34.080]   And when you play with the HTC One and the Galaxy S4, you realize what a boon, a pure
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:37.080]   experience is compared to the crap Ola.
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:44.040]   I mean, both of these phones are loaded with, you know, manufacturer customization.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.920]   So much so it's hard to get them out of the way.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.720]   You can't, on my HTC phone, you can't even delete a lot of the apps and stuff.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:50.720]   No, you can't.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.800]   Which is true on the iPhone as well.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:52.800]   There's what?
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.600]   Nine or ten Apple apps that you can't delete.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:59.000]   But it's a lot more on this on these platforms.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.600]   I love the HTC One.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:04.360]   You're going to have to be in the sense universe just like you are with your DNA there.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.560]   Yeah, I have an, I can't stand AT&T.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.480]   So I go with the HTC DNA.
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:12.360]   Is the Samsung available on Verizon yet or is it just AT&T?
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.560]   I think into the May 30th.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.560]   Very soon.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.560]   You can be out.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.560]   Pre-order now May 28th.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.560]   They're going to start shipping May 30th.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.560]   It'll arrive.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.520]   The problem is Google I/Os on May 15th, 16th.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:26.200]   Don't you think Google's going to announce a successor to the Nexus 4?
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.200]   I'm hoping.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.480]   I don't know if the Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 certainly, but I'm not sure but the Nexus 4 just yet.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.720]   The 4, Tim, tell me this.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.880]   Because the 4, when I first saw it, I thought that is not a mainstream phone.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.440]   It's a developer phone.
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.120]   There's no LTE.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.360]   It's kind of low resolution.
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:44.240]   It's not, but people embraced it because it's pure Google.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.320]   Do you think Google might say, oh, maybe we ought to make one more pure phone, maybe
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.160]   something from Motorola and, you know, this Nexus X people have talked about?
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:57.160]   Yeah, we've been waiting for that pure Motorola phone forever now, you know, since they bought
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:00.400]   the company and we keep getting these indications that no, it's not quite ready yet.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.960]   This could certainly be the time that they drop something on us.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.800]   But the Nexus 4 is still a fairly young phone relative to all things.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:09.000]   I'm not saying that we couldn't necessarily see a new Nexus phone, but if we do, I think
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.720]   it'll be a different device with a larger and perhaps more premium or maybe even smaller
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720]   and cheaper.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.720]   I think a lot of the reason that people are going to the Nexus 4 is because, like you said,
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.720]   it's a pure Google experience, which is great.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.520]   It's also a very low cost device unlocked and it works, you know.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.520]   Three hours a series.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.520]   Very well.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.640]   So, but Google still hasn't quite cracked that LTE nuts.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:32.680]   And I think that, you know, they technology exist for them to do that in their next device.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:38.120]   The rumor is that they will debut a new version of Android, but it won't be a key-wheel line
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.720]   high or key-wheel line.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:46.600]   No, no major release just yet, but another point release, which is a little bit disappointing.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.520]   But, you know, we're still, there's still such a huge lag behind of companies updating.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.840]   Maybe that's for the best, or maybe just we'll add more, you know, add more fragmentation
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.560]   to the market.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.680]   Apple also has its developed.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.880]   So Google I/O is coming up in a couple of weeks.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:00.880]   Apple's coming up in June.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:01.880]   May 15th.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.920]   May 15th for I/O and June 7th for WWDC.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.160]   So, this is a good time of year to kind of gauge what these two companies are up to.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.320]   We'll certainly see, or will we, iOS 7 at WWDC?
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:17.000]   There's been some rumor that they're running behind on it.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.200]   In fact, that they're even transferring people from the OS 10 team over to the iOS team.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.000]   A flattened iOS 7.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.240]   A Johnny Ive iOS 7.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.160]   It sounds like Johnny I was really ripping the guts out of iOS, which honestly to me
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.160]   sounds pretty nice.
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:37.240]   I'm not a fan of skeuomorphism, which is the attempt at giving a 3D lifelike appearance
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.040]   to it, which is probably best typified in the game room, which I think looks terrible.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.760]   So to have all that stuff worked out, I think it was great.
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.080]   And certainly iOS needs some injections of new functionality.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.800]   We're talking earlier about the keyboard.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:51.080]   And I think iOS desperately needs a new keyboard.
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:57.040]   iOS used to be the great glass typing experience, but now it's like behind Android, and certainly
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.600]   Blackberry Tenants just come out with a great keyboard too.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.480]   I think that's really where a lot of innovation is needed.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:04.480]   Yeah, it sounds like they're pulling out all the stops and recruiting as many people
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.480]   as they can in the team to try to get something ready in time for WWDC here in about a month.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.280]   Can they save the app quality?
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:17.600]   Google's apps are so much better all the way down the road from the maps to the calendar,
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.840]   to the mail, to whatever search.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.760]   Sounds like you're bullish on Google.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.760]   I am.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.320]   I used to be Apple's number one fan.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.280]   I was first in line at the Paul Walter store.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.240]   I've been an Apple fan with her for seven years.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.640]   And they have just continued to lose me as a customer.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.640]   I still carry my iPad everywhere.
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.480]   I still sit in front of my big iMac.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.280]   What was it that turned the tailboard?
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:41.080]   The lack of openness, the keyboard.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.480]   I am 30% to 50% faster.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:48.200]   I can beat anybody on any keyboard now with SwiftKey because it predicts what I'm typing.
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.920]   Well, it also has a slow, which is a natural way to...
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.200]   I have a hard time tapping the Apple keyboards.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.480]   So tiny, I always miss the keys.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.520]   I have fingers like...
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.840]   Yeah, golem.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:06.400]   But I can do pretty well on swipe or SwiftKey flow because I just draw.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:11.200]   And contextual apps, I'm seeing more startups come out with apps on Android that are...
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.440]   You can't do Google now very well on iOS.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:14.440]   They're doing it.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.440]   They are.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.880]   But you have to launch Google search.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:21.640]   A developer can't talk to the keyboard, can't mess with the phone, can't mess with the radios.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:23.840]   You'll never see a Facebook home on iOS.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.840]   Right.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.840]   Right.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.840]   Because they can't look in.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.840]   Which might be an advantage to some people, right?
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.840]   I was going to say that's not a good thing.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.840]   But I actually like the Facebook home.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:30.840]   Do you use it?
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:31.840]   You don't have it on here.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:32.840]   I have it in my backpack.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:33.840]   You have a first.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:34.840]   You have a first.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:35.840]   You see one, first or whatever they call it.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.840]   And that's pretty nice.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.840]   I read it for five minutes.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:41.840]   You have that same here.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:42.840]   You have that same here.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.840]   It's all about your Facebook pictures.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:46.840]   Well, you and I aren't going to be the market for that.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:47.840]   But it's well done.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.840]   You have to admit.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.840]   It's smooth.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.840]   It's a nice UI.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.320]   And for a first time out, it's really pretty interesting.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.840]   But no, Apple will never let that happen.
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:00.000]   And you, where Facebook can take over the UI and take over the home screen and take over
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000]   the launcher.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.400]   In this case, they might be right.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.560]   Is there anybody using, is Facebook home a surprise breakout hit?
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.000]   No, I don't think so.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000]   Who loves it?
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000]   Who's using it?
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000]   Really?
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000]   I like it.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]   Oh.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000]   Actually, I have friends who love it.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000]   It's girlfriend saying no.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000]   She's crazy.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.680]   You know, if you're a Facebook person, Mariam is addicted to Facebook.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.680]   So she would love it.
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:22.680]   But she has an iPhone.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:24.960]   So would you use Facebook home, Mariam?
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.400]   You've seen it.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.120]   She says she's not impressed.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.840]   What happens is it buries all the real functionality of the phone underneath two layers of Facebook.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.080]   So if you want to run an app, you have to swipe your head up and then hit the app.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.520]   And it's just, it's just, everything's kind of hidden away beneath the, beneath the
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.520]   near Facebook.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:48.480]   I don't, I can't imagine there's a lot of people who are so in love with Facebook.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480]   They want to live there.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.480]   You have no idea.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.480]   You have no idea.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.480]   Even my teenagers.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.480]   Well, who is it?
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:55.640]   Because the kids don't.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:59.160]   I spoke to these kids in Amsterdam that I went to the university and spoke to them.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.160]   Oh, the Dutch.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.960]   I asked, who does, it's the Dutch?
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.960]   Well, no, you watch people.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.240]   Anyways, I ask them, who does not have Facebook in this audience?
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.640]   Well, everybody has single hat.
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:12.640]   Oh, everybody has, who does not have Facebook in this audience?
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.640]   There's a couple.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:14.640]   Three.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.640]   Yeah, but they're just weirdos.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.600]   Everybody, it's, having Facebook is not the same as saying I'm going to live in Facebook.
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.400]   No, but you watch people.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.360]   There's a lot of ad hits to Facebook.
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:28.280]   I mean, just go to Disney Land and listen to the conversation and the line.
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.360]   Oh, I just put sent this to your Facebook.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.360]   All right.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.360]   But I like it.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.160]   I, but that gives you Facebook just blocked it.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.560]   It shows what happens when you're locked, locked the system down.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.240]   This is what happened in the 90s.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:47.440]   Remember, you know, Apple was so far ahead in the 90s over Windows and Windows just was
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.960]   more open and developers could do more things with it.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:52.520]   So it's not, for me, it's not about Facebook at home.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:57.920]   It's about openness and letting developers do do interesting and innovative things.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:04.600]   Though, you know, it'll be interesting to see where, where Tim Cook takes this company.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:05.600]   The challenge is now.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.040]   And I think what we'll see at WDC is going to tell us a lot about that.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.800]   And I don't, it's hard for me to imagine what a new iPhone might have that would make it
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.760]   a compelling choice over the variety of choices that you have on Android.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:18.760]   You agree, Tim?
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:19.760]   I mean, I'm going to review them all.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.880]   Yeah, I'm definitely very interested to see what this new iOS 7 looks like.
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:26.880]   I mean, Johnny, I definitely has very strong aesthetic sensibility.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.280]   So I'm definitely very curious to see how that transitions from the hardware side of
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:32.520]   things to the, to the software side of things, of course.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:36.600]   But from a functionality standpoint, yeah, I mean, that's certainly like Rob, whoop,
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.560]   was alluding to this a lot of great stuff coming from developers now on the Android
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.560]   side of things.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:44.680]   But sometimes that comes with the expense of pure iOS usability and also pure iOS responsiveness.
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:47.720]   And there are plenty of Android apps that really kind of kill your own performance.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   And that's not something that happens.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.360]   And real people don't even think about this.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.920]   They just say, I'm, I know I'm getting an iPhone because I'm a real person.
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:54.920]   Right.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.160]   And so of course, we're all talking about Google Glass, but there's certainly a lot of anticipation
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.560]   for a wearable device from Apple later this year.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.120]   And I could certainly open up the market too.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.120]   I mean, having something like Glass really requires you to wear something on your face
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:07.440]   that is, you know, ultimately not the most comfortable thing in the world.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:11.360]   But to replace your wristwatch with something that is, you know, far more functional, that
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:16.120]   I think is something that will be much more palatable to the general consumers than kind
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.960]   of a funny looking heads up display.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:22.040]   I didn't bring my basis watch, but I basis and pebble.
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.080]   The wrist is interesting, right?
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:25.800]   But it's not as too much.
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.560]   The problem is you can't do a camera.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.840]   With the pebble, you just, yeah, or even use it as a phone or anything.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.920]   You just, you know, it's a little notifier.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.520]   That's all it is.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:35.960]   It can be a really pretty notifier.
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.600]   I think it's going to be gig jewelry, right?
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:41.680]   You know, and there's a lot of people who buy jewelry that cost a lot more than a watchful
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:42.680]   cost.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.520]   And I think Apple will sell a lot of them.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.520]   Well, we'll see.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:50.760]   So I said it has a cool screen and it has your notifications coming down.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:51.760]   I mean, look at that.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:53.000]   I mean, they're going to show a ton of them.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000]   It's really.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.040]   For some reason, I just feel like Apple is not even going to do it.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.560]   It's all just rumor.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.760]   Now, if you think about what Apple has, they have the world's best supply chain.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.680]   They have the world's best retail channel.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.560]   And the retail channel is all small stores where they want a high turn per square foot.
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:13.560]   Right.
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.480]   What would turn faster per square foot?
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.480]   Perfect.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:23.160]   Watches and maybe something on your face, maybe a small, another iPad with a retina screen.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.160]   Earrings.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.160]   Earrings.
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160]   I could go get his.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.520]   I want to go out and have lots of confidence.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:29.960]   Inclids, I think they're called it.
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:30.960]   Inclids.
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:33.040]   No, that's for people who are in house arrest that you.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:34.040]   That's another.
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:37.440]   It's a great new market to have.
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:40.400]   For the house arrest crowd, the new eye anklet.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.000]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.760]   We're going to wrap these up in just a moment.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:46.040]   But I want to remind you to back up every Sunday.
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:47.840]   I tell everybody you got a backup.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:51.840]   And if you're going to do it, do it right with Carbunite online backup.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.840]   It's the cloud.
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.360]   It's exactly what you want to use a cloud for.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:58.920]   If you have a backup sitting next to your computer and there's a fire, a flutter, disaster,
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.280]   somebody steals all your stuff, your backups are gone too.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:04.160]   The best backup is offsite.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.920]   And if you've got a laptop, carbonite's great on a laptop.
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:12.520]   You know, 180,000 laptops are lost every year on airport conveyor belts.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.120]   It is so crazy not to have a backup in your laptop.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.480]   And that's where carbonite just is great.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.680]   It's automatic anytime you're online, even at an insecure hotspot at a hotel or a coffee
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.120]   shop, carbonite securely backs your data up.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:26.920]   When you change your file, it's backed up instantly.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.880]   It's automatic, continuous backup when you're online.
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:36.320]   And best of all, $59 a year for everything on that laptop or desktop, $59 a year.
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:40.360]   In fact, when you use our offer code to it, you'll get two free bonus months with purchase
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.120]   so it's an even better deal.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:48.840]   Mac or PC, they've got plans for single computers, external drives, servers, businesses as well,
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.000]   always for one low flat annual rate, and unlimited backup too.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000]   And I really like that.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000]   Plus it's cloud storage.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.880]   You can see your carbonite stuff anywhere, multiple servers, multiple homes so you know
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.720]   you're safe everywhere you go.
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:06.560]   You got to try it, carbonite.com, no credit card needed, just our offer code to it two
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.000]   free weeks.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.960]   That's probably enough in most cases to do your first backup set and then just make
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:14.560]   those changes as you change files.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.960]   Two months free when you purchase if you use our offer code to it, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:19.960]   carbonite.com.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:25.160]   Use our offer code to it for a free trial, no credit card needed.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:27.240]   I think we covered all the big stories.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.800]   I'm just looking here.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.480]   There's lots of questions about Google Glass, but we'll probably stick in on the chat room.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.960]   I think we spent quite a while.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:36.360]   We could stick around after the show if you want to just take field questions about Google
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.440]   Glass.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:40.320]   Those of you in the chat room, I think yeah, there's a lot of interest in it.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.920]   It's one of those things I think only a small fraction of 1% of the population is going
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.960]   to get to use until they're a consumer product.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.320]   I try to give mine to everybody who I see in the street just so they can try them out
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.160]   because there's so much interest about it.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.040]   It is a very rare device and everyone's really excited to try it out.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.680]   It's a universal reaction.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:59.680]   It's a universal reaction.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:00.680]   Wow.
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:01.680]   Wow.
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:06.160]   It's definitely well, which surprisingly, I think that wow factor lasts a couple of
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:09.400]   hours and then you kind of quickly get over it and then you have to make the broader decision
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.840]   to just really fit into my life.
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:14.880]   It's just really worth the commitment of putting this thing on my face every morning.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:18.680]   And then I think that is a decision that's going to be changing over time as the apps
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:20.320]   come and everything else comes to the platform.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.320]   What's the wow?
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.760]   The wow is just seeing that display floating in space.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:28.760]   I mean, it ultimately is just a display, but to be able to see your information there,
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:32.200]   the wow for me was actually the first time I did it hang out with my wife.
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:35.160]   I thought that the idea of doing a hangout with somebody who can't see you was kind of
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.160]   a dumb idea.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:39.380]   But the first time I did it with my wife and I could see her reaction to what I was
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:41.080]   seeing and see her talking to me.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:42.640]   That was my first wow moment.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:45.440]   Oh, so she won't see you, but she'll see what you're looking at.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:46.440]   Right.
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.840]   So I was standing on the beach of California and it was a beautiful view.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.560]   And I thought, I'll get my wife a call and see it so that she can see what I'm seeing.
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:56.520]   But you know, think about going to a museum with your friends and they can't join you,
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.440]   but you could walk through the museum and have a conversation with your friends and
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.800]   say, Hey, check out this exhibit that I met.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:01.800]   This is really cool.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:03.120]   And they could all join in with you.
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:05.720]   That's kind of cool for a lot of people as the voice.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:06.720]   So watch this.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.720]   Okay, glass.
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:11.100]   Take a picture and it works.
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:12.660]   Yeah, I saw you take a picture.
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:17.260]   Voice and this is a parlor trick, but the fact that the seven commands that are on this
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:23.260]   home screen always work with everybody really gets people like, wow, that is cool.
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:26.660]   It's a parlor trick because you have to read the command exactly as it appears.
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:28.820]   You say, okay, glass, take a photo.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:29.820]   It does not work.
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:31.580]   You have to say, okay, glass, take a picture.
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:34.180]   You could be pretty accurate if you have a highly constrained vocabulary.
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:35.180]   Yes.
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:36.180]   And that's why it's a parlor trick.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:39.940]   You should get deeper and say, you know, try to get directions to an address or something.
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:45.340]   It makes a lot of mistakes there, just like your cell phone or Siri would make a mistake.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:47.740]   Well, I'm not exactly a believer.
[01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:49.820]   And yet I do think it's an interesting technology.
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:55.420]   And I think time will tell, but I think it depends on the price.
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:56.420]   It depends on the price.
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:57.420]   I think it also everybody.
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:00.780]   I mean, people here would buy one at $200.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:01.780]   You guys are not.
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:03.300]   No, this matches every audience.
[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:06.140]   I've given seven speeches with about a half the audience.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:12.140]   I bet half the audience would pay $50 to try it on and use it for a day.
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:16.660]   I really feel like what Tim is saying is like, okay, it's really cool for that two-hour
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:18.220]   span.
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.180]   But is it something I'm willing to commit to?
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:24.460]   And is it going to change my life in the way that I think it's necessary to wear this
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:26.380]   item every day?
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.460]   I don't know.
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:29.860]   I don't think the price really matters at that point.
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:32.300]   I think the price gets you in the door.
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:35.420]   But it's the usefulness of keeping them off.
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:38.020]   I think the interface is very, very poor.
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:41.100]   I think it needs to be more comfortable, easier to use.
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:42.860]   And there's a lot of work that has to be done there.
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:43.860]   It's a 20-year product.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:45.860]   Oh, it is.
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:46.860]   I agree.
[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:47.860]   It's like the Apple II.
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:48.860]   It's like the Apple II.
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.860]   And I think that, you know, what I need is an optic implant.
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:52.860]   Frankly.
[01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:54.460]   Well, that's your 20.
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:56.460]   If you stay alive 20 years, they'll have my vitamins.
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:57.460]   I'll have my vitamins.
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:58.460]   20 years for now.
[01:51:58.460 --> 01:51:59.460]   20 years, I'll be 76.
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:00.460]   It'll be perfect.
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:01.460]   And gagget will have a whole thing on...
[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:05.260]   I won't be able to get out of bed, but I can go to Paris.
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.260]   Is this safe?
[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:07.260]   Is the optic implant safe?
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:09.820]   That I don't care about.
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:10.820]   Ironically.
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.820]   Go ahead.
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:12.820]   Give me a tap right here.
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:13.820]   I don't care about it.
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:14.820]   All right.
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:15.820]   Hey, thank you.
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:16.820]   Tim Stevens, Engaget.com.
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:18.780]   It's so great to have you.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:22.500]   And boy, that was a perfect LTE-lived this time.
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:23.500]   Yes.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:24.980]   And the lights are on now too, so it's just a dark game.
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:25.980]   Thank you so much for having me on.
[01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:26.980]   It's always a pleasure.
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:28.540]   Oh, it's always a great time.
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:29.540]   Thank you, Tim.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:32.580]   Thanks to Ryan Shratt, Twitch this week in computer hardware is every Thursday in our
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:33.580]   network.
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:35.020]   And of course, he does great work at PCPer.
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:38.900]   If you are building a PC, if you're one of the few, I tell everybody this, the hardware
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:42.900]   leaderboard tells you the latest, greatest stuff.
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:46.900]   And Leo, if I can, I want to plug a project that we're working on right now.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:47.900]   Good.
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:49.900]   All right.
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:54.700]   So we've started an Indiegogo project to try to rebuild all of our studio and set and
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:57.460]   cameras and lighting and all that kind of stuff here.
[01:52:57.460 --> 01:52:58.460]   Trying to keep up with you.
[01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:00.500]   It's a little bit tougher.
[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.020]   So we started a project.
[01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:03.020]   We got some pretty cool...
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:05.700]   We got T-shirts and different groups you can get in.
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:08.180]   You can join the podcast for an episode and do a lot of things.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:09.180]   What a good idea, Ryan.
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.180]   That's great.
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:11.180]   What do you look at?
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:12.980]   How much are you looking to spend?
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:15.260]   So our initial goal was 10,000.
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:16.940]   We hit that in a week.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:17.940]   Wow.
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:19.180]   But we had plans out there.
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:22.940]   Here's what we can do for 20 and here's what we can do for 30,000.
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:27.580]   And we have a much smaller space than you do, but I think we can do...
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:28.580]   It was...
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:30.260]   I remember talking with people just this week about it.
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.260]   What can you really do with $30,000?
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:36.060]   It doesn't seem like that much money in terms of studio type stuff.
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:38.420]   And I look at what...
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.420]   I think when you were building...
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:42.300]   I spent 30,000 on cameras alone.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:43.300]   Yeah.
[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:47.660]   But when you talked about what a benefit it was or how much the cost had gone down when
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:51.780]   you built the brick house as opposed to what you did at Tech TV.
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:53.740]   And I'm trying to see if maybe we can do it for a little bit less.
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.900]   More software side of things instead of hardware side of things.
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:01.220]   So if you just go to PCpert.com on the right-hand side, there will be a weird looking picture.
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:03.460]   I'm sure it may be with a link to the Indiegogo.
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:05.100]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.100]   Good luck.
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.100]   I think that's great.
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:08.100]   It's a really good use of Indiegogo.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:09.460]   I kind of regret not using it.
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:11.140]   We asked Kickstarter and they said, "No."
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:13.060]   And I should have gone to Indiegogo.
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:14.060]   Yeah.
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.100]   I actually filled it all out on Kickstarter.
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.980]   And the more and more I ran into their rules, it's like, "Well, I'm not actually producing
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:19.980]   a product."
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:20.980]   Right.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:21.980]   So they're a little bit...
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:22.980]   No, like established business.
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:25.340]   They actually turned us down.
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.620]   Brian Brushwood used Indiegogo and he recommended I.
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:28.620]   I think it's a huge one.
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:29.620]   It's good.
[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:31.860]   Yeah, they're a little looser with the requirements.
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:32.860]   Good luck.
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:35.420]   PCpert.com, find out more.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:39.340]   Robert Scobel, the Scobelizer, will be wearing glass in his shower tonight and every night
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:40.340]   thereafter.
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.340]   I don't think so, actually.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:43.340]   No, that's enough of that.
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:45.420]   That was a little bit of a staged fun thing.
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:46.660]   But you know what's great is that...
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.540]   I think that's an iconic photo.
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:50.980]   And you can't plan these.
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:51.980]   But that went viral.
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:54.180]   And it's going to be 20 years from now, people are going to see that picture.
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:58.540]   I just needed a way to beat Tim, because Tim was writing all these great reviews, daily
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:54:59.540]   usage.
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:02.540]   That's like, "Oh, I have to have the waterproof."
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:07.020]   I need to have the waterproof photo to explain that these are water resistant.
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.660]   You can take them out in the rain.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:10.700]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:13.220]   But anyway, I'm working on a book too.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:14.220]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:15.220]   What's the name of that?
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:19.460]   "Egypt context will be out in October and I'm studying all these things for Rackspace."
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:20.460]   Very cool.
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:21.460]   That's a lot of fun.
[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:23.460]   Where's the best place to find your stuff?
[01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:25.300]   It says Google+, or Facebook.
[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:26.300]   Okay.
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:27.300]   All right.
[01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:28.300]   Search for Scobel.
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:29.300]   Very good.
[01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:32.100]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific.
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:33.100]   At 6 p.m.
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.940]   Eastern Time 2200 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:36.780]   Love it if you watch live.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:39.980]   We certainly pay attention to the chat room, and that's a great way to interact directly
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:42.060]   with the show during a live episode.
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.740]   But on demand is also great.
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:48.140]   We make audio and video available after the fact at twit.tv.
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:53.620]   Last chance this week, final week to buy the Twit T. This is the one-of-a-kind, unique
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:55.820]   T-shirt that we got designed on 99 Designs.
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:59.260]   If you go to Teespring, another startup.
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:02.100]   T-W-E-Spring.com/twit.
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:04.100]   $15 benefits Twit.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:06.020]   I don't know what that means.
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:07.540]   I'm going to get a nicer car.
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:09.260]   I don't know what it benefits Twit.
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:14.140]   We have a rent went up to 11,000 a month.
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:16.180]   There's a few things we could spend there.
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:17.180]   Google.
[01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:18.180]   I know.
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:19.180]   You're going to need 4K cameras.
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:20.180]   All right.
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:21.180]   I don't want to tell you how much we spent building this studio.
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:22.180]   We need to start the boys there.
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.180]   I was there.
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:24.180]   I know a little bit.
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:27.820]   You're going to need 4K cameras soon, right?
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:28.820]   Don't shut up.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:34.420]   We're going to need to start the 4K fun for Leo, so we can see you and really hide down.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.500]   No, you don't.
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:37.500]   You do not want to.
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.980]   Do watch the show live, but if you can't, Twit.tv.
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:44.100]   And of course, wherever you can get podcast iTunes to zoom store, the Xbox Store, all
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:45.100]   of that.
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:46.100]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:47.100]   We'll see you next time.
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:48.100]   Stick around afterwards if you want.
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:50.940]   We're going to do a little more on Google Glass.
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:51.940]   And we'll see you next week.
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:52.940]   This is amazing.
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:53.940]   It's in the can.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:57:00.220]   Do the Twit.
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:03.580]   All right.
