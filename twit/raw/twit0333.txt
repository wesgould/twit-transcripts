[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.400]   Well, happy holidays, everybody.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.720]   Welcome once again to something we've done now three years,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.560]   maybe four in a row.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.400]   I've lost count.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.320]   Our annual Twit holiday special.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.600]   It's just-- we want to break format,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.280]   get out of the whole news thing, and just talk festive occasions.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.240]   Tom Merritt is here also.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.200]   This is the first time-- I love the fireplace the first time
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.840]   we've ever used this set.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.080]   And it's just really beautiful decorations.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.200]   It's a little-- I'm not feeling the warmth now.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.640]   Well, you know, it's a studio.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.640]   We don't like it.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.040]   I like the Jim Beam bottle in the foreground.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   That's nice.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.320]   It's less empty than it looks.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.360]   Now once again, coming back as before,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.760]   we've got our great friends, first Paul and Storm,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.200]   who are on the top row.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.320]   There we go.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.880]   That's Paul.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.440]   There's Storm.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   There we go.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.880]   Look at that.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.960]   We're going to put you all in like a Hollywood squares
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.080]   thing this time, which is kind of fun.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.280]   Jonathan Colton on the left there.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.480]   And in the lower right hand corner,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   the eccentric millionaire himself, Mr. John--
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.920]   billionaire.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.760]   Billionaire.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.400]   No, no.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.200]   Millionaire.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.960]   Just millions, I believe.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.320]   It's called the center square.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.360]   John Hodgman, the block.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.160]   That was--
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.800]   Now I need to put on a Paul in--
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   mascot.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   I thought that was your shadow, Steven's.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.200]   So it's good to have you once again.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.120]   If you don't mind, I'm going to put on my slippers,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.760]   because I think it's-- we want to be relaxed here and enjoy.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.560]   These are brought to me from Holland.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.360]   These are wooden shoe slippers.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.240]   They're not wood.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.560]   But now, all their slippers are comfy.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.720]   They look like they're made from pica chews.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.520]   They are.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.800]   I think they're made from big bird.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.480]   They're soft as peeps, and they're just very comfortable.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.120]   So happy holidays, you guys.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.000]   We're all together on a boat, weren't you, this year?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.400]   Yes, and we will be again soon.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:39.240]   The Joko Cruz Crazy number two is wet in January.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.040]   February 19 through the 26th.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.400]   Ah, after Valentine's Day.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.600]   So the late January, the one called February.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.760]   Late January, extremely late January.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.600]   So tell us about that from last year.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.240]   How did it go?
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.760]   Was it fun?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.960]   It was pretty much an unmitigated disaster.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.560]   Was it the Poseidon Adventure number two?
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.960]   No, it was pretty great, actually.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.520]   It was the first one we'd ever done.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.040]   So we didn't know how things were going to go.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   But I don't know.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.920]   Our crowd is just such a fun bunch of people.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.800]   We planned a bunch of stuff, and then they
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.280]   planned a bunch more stuff.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.880]   And they made it a lot more fun.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.240]   And it was just a blast.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.400]   I mean, you're on a cruise ship.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.520]   You can't really go wrong when you're on a cruise ship,
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.000]   even if you didn't do anything on a cruise ship, which is kind
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.480]   of what you're supposed to do on a cruise ship.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.400]   You would have a great time.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.840]   That was Twitter's business plan.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.400]   We planned a bunch of stuff, and then they
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.920]   planned a bunch more stuff.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.480]   Well, exactly.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.040]   That's the internet way.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.960]   Yeah, it is.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.040]   You never know what your users are going to do.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.240]   So there's still room on the February cruise.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.800]   You're going to be on the Western Dam, which I've
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.720]   been on as a very nice boat, really nice boat.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.080]   May I just jump in for a second?
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.560]   Yes, Mr. Hodgman.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.280]   Well, you know, Jonathan's called my friends for a long time.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.840]   Sorry.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.080]   And so I don't mean to criticize him in any way.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.520]   But he just did a very terrible job selling this cruise.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.020]   I know.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.240]   Here's the thing.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.200]   This is his business enterprise.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.280]   He's the only one who makes money off of this thing.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.560]   I'm paying money to go on it.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.400]   OK?
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.520]   Now, probably that's not as an arranged millionaire.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.920]   And I can afford to do that.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.840]   But it's also because I want to be there.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.520]   And you do, too, internet.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.440]   No, it's really-- I went into that thing.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.440]   And I thought, what?
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.600]   And that was a lot of skepticism, a lot of concerns.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   Wait, how is this better?
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.920]   How is this better than what I did?
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.120]   Wait for the other Dutch slipper to fall.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.040]   I came out of this with slightly fewer mis-covions
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.160]   and trepidation.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.880]   Were you worried that, like, versus the boat would sink?
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.520]   Is that one of the issues?
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.360]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.120]   I believe in science.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.680]   I was concerned because I had read the David Foster Wallace
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.840]   piece in Harper's years ago in which David Foster Wallace said
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.200]   riding on a cruise ship is depressing.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.560]   He killed himself, I think, right?
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.760]   I think it may have been the case that he was depressed
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   while he was on the boat.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.260]   Right.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.400]   Because the ship itself could go either way.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.240]   He described it as an act of disgusting,
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.120]   disgusting, gross consumerism that filled him with on-way.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.320]   And because I was in my 20s at the time that I read this article,
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.920]   I presumed it would also fill me with horrible on-way.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.800]   But it turns out, if you're in your 30s,
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   and you don't care about anything--
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.040]   It's not much on-way left.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.560]   You have no ideals left.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.240]   It's actually fun to drink the martini at 10 AM.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.520]   Little side next to a frozen dolphin ice sculpture.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.440]   And then I was concerned also that as much as I love Jonathan's
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.920]   music, and as much as I adore his fans from afar,
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.000]   I was concerned that we were all going to be consumed alive
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.840]   by code monkey fans.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   But they couldn't have been the nicer people, honestly.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.520]   And of course, I was obviously concerned because Paul and Storm
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.640]   were going to be there.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.920]   But they were going to--
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.640]   They weren't so bad.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.800]   And the feeling-- it was one of the most remarkable weeks
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.680]   that I've ever experienced to the point where now,
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.440]   I'm not just telling you internet,
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.480]   I'm going around to legitimate famous people
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.960]   that I know and actually propose.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.840]   And telling them, you should pay money to come on this boat
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.760]   and experience this because it's a lot of fun.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.840]   Do you think having Paul and Storm soaked up a lot of the on-way?
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.120]   We were like, on-way sponges.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   On-way magnet.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.720]   On-way sponges, exactly.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.160]   We laid down a base of on-weave and sort of muted everyone
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.640]   else's.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.040]   So yes, so you know what?
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.000]   It's February 19 through the 26th.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.560]   And it's on my consumer season gift
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.000]   gauge, to be sure.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.440]   I think whatever amount of money you're
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.840]   going to get on to get on this thing,
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.320]   you're going to have the time of your life.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   It is really a good time.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.880]   And the performers who are on this,
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.560]   you got Jonathan Colton with his amazing new artificial heart.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.840]   You got Paul and Storm.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.680]   You've got John Roderick of the Long Winters,
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.040]   the famous comedian Paul F. Tomkins, M.C. Front, a lot.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.880]   Not a little.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.320]   Front, not a little.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.880]   Not a lot.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.440]   Well, Wheaton's got a lot.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.240]   Well, Wheaton is going to be there.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.720]   Yes.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.680]   For heaven's sakes, it's just going to be--
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.240]   and lots and lots more to come.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.920]   And if you're curious, who else could be on this boat?
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.600]   It's a big boat.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.200]   The Western Dam is a beautiful boat.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.880]   And so I think you should go to the website,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.840]   check it out, count your pennies,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.400]   cash in your gift cards, and go on this thing.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.120]   Joe Cocoo's crazy.com.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.760]   Now, is there entertainment aboard, or is it--
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.920]   Oh, is it solid on you, E?
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.080]   No, there's a ton of entertainment.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.200]   Those performers that I talked about, none of us
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.520]   are going to do anything on the thing.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.720]   Just pretty much stay in our campus.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.320]   No, I went on the giant cruise.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.800]   I went on a cruise with the San Francisco Giants
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.280]   when they won the pennant in 1989.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.040]   And that's what they did.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.280]   They stayed in their cabin.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.440]   We knew they were on the boat, but that's all we really knew.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.400]   Do you expect them to play a game, or--
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.440]   Kevin?
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.480]   No, some come out.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.560]   Kevin Mitchell came out once, and he
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.520]   was a very large man, former convict.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.200]   He's lots of tattoo.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.960]   And big, he got in the hot tub.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.920]   All the water came out, and that was it.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.000]   And that was like the event of the whole lives.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.960]   That was the highlight of the cruise.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.840]   So you guys come out of your cab.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.400]   That will happen on this boat as well.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:37.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.880]   I'll get more of the bass.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.720]   You have Kevin Mitchell?
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.560]   That's great.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.520]   But he's not getting a cabin.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.960]   They're being forced to sleep on the leader deck.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.600]   Now, John, you're an eccentric millionaire.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.760]   You can afford to do something like this.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.440]   What about the average person in the audience?
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.240]   Is this going to be beyond their means?
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.120]   Well, I mean, look, it's--
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.520]   Jonathan, I don't want to-- I don't want to speak about numbers
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   here, because--
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.200]   I'm a ghost.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.840]   Yeah, I know.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.160]   I think-- Jonathan, you correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:16.560]   A human could go on this boat week at a basic level cabin,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.320]   which means to say it's underwater.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.200]   But it's in the boat, though.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.160]   It's not under-- outside underwater.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.960]   You're in the boat.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.560]   Not on its side, car, for example.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.040]   Right.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.240]   If I could drag the lawn on a zodiac--
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.280]   It's immersible.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.440]   You're on the--
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.760]   at a basic level cabin, a week's worth of entertainment,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.560]   and a week's worth of food and non-alcoholic drink,
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.280]   included in your price.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.160]   Could you get that for under $1,000, Jonathan?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.240]   You could get it for just under $1,000.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.360]   That's right.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.440]   It's a pretty good deal for a week-long vacation with all--
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.920]   food included, all food.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.320]   A plus.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.160]   And, you know, it's not a restaurant.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.120]   You could call them.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.960]   This is the craziest thing.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.760]   This is the awesome thing about the cruise ship.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.240]   Any time of day, you call them up and you say,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.840]   I would like a club sandwich and a plate of cookies delivered
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   to my room, and somebody arrived.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.600]   I don't consider playing a cookie.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.520]   That's exactly right.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.320]   No matter your drunk you are or what time it is.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.560]   So is Sam Kennison on the boat, or is that just--
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.840]   I know.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.040]   It's Bobcat Goldflate.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.120]   That sounded like Goldflate.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.800]   It sounded like Bobcat.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   That was right.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.120]   Wow.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.960]   All room services included.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.280]   It's a week-long vacation.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.440]   And if you get a friend to go with you, Jonathan,
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.800]   don't they get a deal on the cabin?
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.200]   If you're sharing a cabin with a friend,
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.080]   it averages out a little bit less than that per person, right?
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   No.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   Great.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.480]   So you say it's a little bit such a salesman.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.840]   That's a good sale.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.000]   If you have three or four people, yes, it is true.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.600]   If you have three or four people,
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.640]   there is the savings to be had.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.840]   Although we should mention that there are only double cabins
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.160]   left in our inventory.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.640]   All right.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.400]   Thank you.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   Thank you for--
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   This is going to basically be--
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.720]   Also, also Norwalk Virus.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.880]   That's all right.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.640]   How much would you normally pay for Legionnaire's disease
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.320]   on land?
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.880]   All the hand sanitizer, you can use that's complimentary,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.160]   right?
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.840]   They include that.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.520]   If you're not a member of the American Legion,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.760]   it can be quite expensive.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.720]   I did find that was one thing.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.680]   And I know Holland America--
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.280]   I mean, many Holland America cruises--
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   they really love the hand sanitizer.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.360]   So much so that when you go--
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.000]   this is not going to help sell it either.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.200]   But when you go into the dining room,
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.640]   there's a very nice Filipino guy standing there with--
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.000]   Always.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.840]   Am I wrong?
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.520]   Yes.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.040]   Am I wrong?
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.680]   You tell me, guys, you've been there.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.800]   And he's got a large kind of amorphous bag.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.080]   It could be a giant breast implant.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.920]   That's hard to say.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.320]   But there's a spout on it.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.040]   And he has it on his arm.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.080]   And you come in and you hold out your hands and goes,
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.280]   and that's hand sanitizer.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.800]   And you're going to go like a bagpipe?
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:09.480]   It's like a k
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.200]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.160]   First of all, why were you on it last week?
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.440]   I just heard about this.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.560]   I just heard about this.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.360]   That it was going to be a quality experience.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.880]   You can't just pull the cruise and take it on faith.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.080]   And indeed, the guys with the hand sanitizer--
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   Let me explain.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.080]   When a group such as--
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080]   I'm afraid of these for the next week.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   I just want this to be out there now.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080]   Are you guys--
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   Mm-hmm.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   When?
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080]   On the book.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080]   Be most.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.080]   A Caribbean cruise for--
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   Yes.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080]   $0.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   $0 euros just to check out.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   Correct.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   Well, here, what they do is for a group such as ours.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.080]   For group such as ours, they provide what is called a site
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.080]   inspection, which involves, in this case, four of us to go on the
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.080]   boat and follow the same exact itinerary and pretend to work
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   for a week.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.080]   Well, that's four of you right there, right?
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   That worked out.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   Who went?
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.080]   It was the--
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.080]   Stormman--
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.080]   Stormman myself, our stage manager Liz and my wife.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   Oh.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.080]   Liz, huh?
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.080]   Liz, yes.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080]   Liz.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.080]   Liz, yeah.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   Well, I love your wife.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   Absolutely.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.080]   Without reservation.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   You had a great time.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.080]   Great.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   So-- but did they still have the bagpipe or sanitizer?
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   I would say it's actually-- they now have a big plastic container
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   that, honestly, he keeps wrapped in a towel, like a small baby.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   Oh, that's good.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.080]   But yes, there's still a spout on the end of it that he spent
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.080]   lovingly in tear out-- outstretched hands.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.080]   But they're jolly, and it's really kind of neat because the
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.080]   crews-- the crews stepped, despite the fact that they're stacked
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.080]   like kindling below decks most of the time, are really very happy
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.080]   and festive, and I think they enjoy their jobs.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.080]   No one we--
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   No one--
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.080]   No one we there.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.080]   Well, it's because of their all night Irish dance music parties
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   that they have.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.080]   That's right.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.080]   Hell yeah.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.080]   So--
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.080]   It's all the second having in cars.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.080]   So there are seats left still for this--
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.080]   Jart seats.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.080]   Oh, definitely.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   Birds.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.080]   Is that what they call them?
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.080]   They're only seats.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.080]   You can see her left.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   It's not like a train where you have to pay more if you want to
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   sleep.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   You could just have--
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.080]   You could go on the cruise in a chair like this, and it would
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080]   recline.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   You're a four-hand-flip.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.080]   OK.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.080]   But you'll be having too much fun to sleep.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.080]   That's right.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   It's not--
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:47.080]   No, the reality is that I had a very nice cabin last year with a
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   beautiful view of the ocean, but I spent two seconds in it.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   The entire time.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   Cabin doesn't matter.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.080]   No.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   Drinking martinis and playing Scrabble and listening to funny
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   jokes told by people that I didn't know and listening to beautiful
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.080]   music played by people that I did know.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   It was the greatest.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   They do some wonderful things.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   They do a--
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   I'm literally taking a loss on this, and I'm still talking.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   It's wonderful.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   I do this at least yearly.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   I go on a geek cruise.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   The same group puts it together.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080]   That puts yours together.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   Neil Bauman and his wonderful company.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   These are great fun.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   And they have-- I think this-- I remember this also.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   They have a midnight buffet.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   Do they not?
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   People have eaten already seven or eight meals through the day.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   Every 15 or 17 minutes they feed you.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   And nevertheless, for some reason at midnight, they're starving.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   And they have a midnight buffet that they lay out just beautiful
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   ice sculpture and stuff.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.080]   And people like Buffalo come running in and trample it all.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   No extra charge, right?
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   And there's no extra charge for that.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.080]   To be fair, it's a cruise, so they're very old Buffalo.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   You can easily overpower them.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   It's not hard.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   I know for a fact that the people who go on your cruise
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.080]   are young and vibrant and helpful.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   Very great.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   I want to destroy that stereotype right now.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   There were some elderly people on the cruise, but in all,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   I felt every cliche that I understood about a cruise was destroyed,
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   was sunk, I would say.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   Yes.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.080]   Lots of chic young European people on this thing.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   Yeah, I don't know where they came from.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   They were a lot of--
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   That's where I learned to wear a little neckerchief like this.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   They were fetching beauties.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   I'm just curious, is that what they call a soul patch down there?
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   Or is it the marker leak?
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.080]   It's a substash.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   OK.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.080]   Is it the code?
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   The demi-stash.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.080]   A subordinate stache.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.080]   A subordinate stache.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   John is the deranged millionaire who is the author of now three
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:52.080]   volumes of books in the-- what do you call this trilogy?
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.080]   Everything you need to know?
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.080]   Complete world knowledge.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   Trilogy.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   That's a-- yeah.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   Well, now that I've written three books, it is now finally complete.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   And the first, the areas of my expertise is on Audible, yes?
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080]   Yes, it is.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   Is it along with my friend Jonathan Colton?
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   He performs.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   He performs the--
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   He performs the--
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   The--
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.080]   --as is the second book, which was called More Information than you
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.080]   require.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   Wonderful performance there.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   And the third will be as well.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   That was my question.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.080]   As soon as I-- yes.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.080]   Believe me, lots of people are asking.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   You know, so the books-- if there are people out there who don't--
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.080]   I've never read a word that I've written-- these are books of fake trivia.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.080]   They're made up facts.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   So like the old book of lists where it would give a list of the nine US presidents who love to smoke cigars,
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.080]   mine is the nine US presidents who had hooks for hands and the stories behind them.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   So-- and the three books are separate.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   You can read them together.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   You can read them individually.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.080]   And the third, that is all, is the one that has just been published.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   And as with all of them, I will eventually get together.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   I hope with my friend Jonathan Colton and maybe even my friends Paul and Storm and some other special guests
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   and get into a studio and record it for audio book on tape, as I used to call it.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   But that will probably happen next year.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.080]   You probably want to get this before you go on the "Cruise Crazy Cruise," the joke, "Cruise Crazy Cruise,"
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   because you have a whole section here on "Boat Etiquette" and "Law of the Sea," a word of warning regarding the ocean.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   You called the facts fake, but they're also true.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.080]   Right, they're quantum facts.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   "Trotiger's Fact."
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.080]   They're here.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   Once they're in the box of this book, you don't know whether they're alive or dead.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   But they have guns.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   And many-- you explain the myth of posh, which--
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   Yes.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   --is not poured out by a starboard home.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.080]   No, it's put on second helicopter.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   Of course.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   Back in the time of luxury Atlantic crossing, there's a story that the term posh derived from a sea-lining acronym,
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   "Port Outward Starboard Home," which is to say your cabin would move back and forth, depending on where you were.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:33.080]   And thus benefit from the sun and the best views of the endless life-dedding ocean.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.080]   But that is, in fact, apocryphal.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   It actually stands for put on second helicopter because during the first decade of the last century,
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   during the Titanic time, this was a very, very much regimented class system.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:03.080]   So you would have first class, and then you would have Skiridge, and then you would have the place where the Irish hung around.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.080]   Right?
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:14.080]   And what was not known, because it was kept secret, was that for the best class of passengers, they had escape helicopters.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.080]   They were obviously very rudimentary helicopters.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   They only went about a foot off the surface of the water.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   But it was better than sitting in a boat with someone who was beneath you.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   And they had to keep the helicopters a secret from the rest of the ship.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:41.080]   That's why this is not largely reported, because they were very, very fragile, and there was concern that if an ethnic person touched their memberness wings, they would just fall apart.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   Like an Irishman.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   So they couldn't tell the Irish or the Italian people that there was a chance to survive should the ship sink.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   But the second helicopters were very common.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   There actually was another class, the P-O-F-H, put on first helicopter.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.080]   But that was very, very, very super exclusive.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.080]   And that's why there's usually only one there.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:10.080]   And the reason I asked, and by the way, we do have some chatroom questions.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.080]   If we'll get to one when we get back for our...
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   I refuse to answer them.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   Well, they're not for you anyway, so that's okay.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.080]   Then I'll answer them.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:22.080]   Somebody in the chatroom wants to know if there will be women on the cruise.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   So we'll answer that just a bit.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   But I do want to mention audible.com, because two out of the three complete areas of knowledge books are available.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   Complete world knowledge.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   And the third of the complete world knowledge right now in audible.com.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   And the third soon.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:23:00.800]   But that's perfect, because our deal is for two books free if you go to audible.com/entruthu
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   and you're not...
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   We can't have an electronic edition.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   That'll just be wiped out by the amigables.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   And so, but I would encourage people.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   Right now, the book is half off, both at Amazon and at Barnes & Noble.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   And I believe it will continue to be when this airs.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   Is that both poorly for the sales of the book?
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   Or is that...
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   I mean, has it already been remaindered?
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   Not at all, even if it's half off.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.800]   As long as in print, the knowledge counts.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   Okay.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   But it's a remarkable deal for complete world knowledge.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   And it is my life's work and it's the last one of these books that I'll ever write.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   And I think the best of the three.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   So, I don't know if you're completing...
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   Can I say something about your book, John?
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   Yeah, sure, please.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   Because I think, you know, you and I have been friends for a long time.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   And so, I'm a little biased.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   I admit that.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   But I do think that this is the best book of the three.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   All of these books, and if you haven't read them, you should read them all because they're
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.800]   all great.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   But they start from this funny place of ridiculousness.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   The facts that are not real facts.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   And somehow, impossibly.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   And this is the thing that is so amazing about John.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   Somehow, possibly, they come around to a kind of truth and a kind of moving piece of human
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   experience that I don't think you could get to except through ridiculous, fake facts.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   It's a very hard thing to explain.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.800]   But this book, this third book, by far, I think is the most successful at doing that.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   It makes you laugh, but it's also incredibly sad at the same time.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   Wow.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   Which, as you know, is my favorite thing in the world.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   Well, go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   Sign up for the platinum account.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   You'll get two books, first two books.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   And then, as John says, you'll want the hardcover.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   Do you make less money on the audio?
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   Is that why, John?
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   No, I don't make money on any of it.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   So it doesn't really--
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   He's getting these royalty statements, and I don't know what these numbers mean.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   What's because you're royalty, is it?
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   No, I love-- believe me, I love the audio books and everything else.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   Please, everyone buy everything I've ever done.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   Again and again.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   You can get them for free.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   But John still gets his zero royalty, even if you get it for free.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   So do we invite you more information than you require?
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   There you go.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   That's in the ears of those ex-prostatives.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   And by the way, there are all the words that are in the book on the audio version.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   Almost certainly yes for the first one, "Arias of My Expertise" was the first book.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   In fact, there's singing that's not in the book.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   No, in both cases they're enhanced by me talking to other people.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   A large Jonathan Colton and Paul Rudd on the first time, maybe forgetting some people in the second book.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   It's this bizarre cast of characters.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   It's Jonathan, it's Paul Rudd, it's Rachel Maddow, it's Dick Cabot, it's Paul Hopkins, Zach Health.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   Wow.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   Lots and lots of people.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   And then for the third one, I don't know.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   Part of the reason I haven't recorded it yet is in part that I haven't had time.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   And in part because I want to do something really spectacular and I get really very excited.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   I assumed you'd been waiting like James Cameron for the technology to catch up with your vision.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.800]   Whatever that might be.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   It's the 3D audio book.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   That'll be good.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   So again, Audible.com.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   I want to do it on the bottom of the ocean.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   I'm just perfecting a submersible.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   Something.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   That will be able to carry all these special guest stars to the bottom.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   Actually.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   To the abyssal.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   I do want to show, and we'll get to this too.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   Let me finish this, Audible.com/Twit2.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   Try it out, you're going to love it, you can listen to it.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   You can just wonderful.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   Even we know you're Audible fans.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   And listen to John read his books because he does the performance and have John Hinkolden
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   and these other great people.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   It's fantastic.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   By the way, Evan who's here in the audience brought me a little gift.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   He's in our studio audience today.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   I don't know how he knew, but then he said, "John, it's a John Involved of Yeager."
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   Christmas miracle.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   It's imported.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   Oh, this is from, this is from wherever Yeager Meister is made.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   So that's pretty.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   Brought to you from Edmonton, is that what he said?
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   Edmonton.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   Good be.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   Yeager will hire you.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   Thank you Evan, that's very kind of you.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   The fireplace has suddenly come to life.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   This really is there.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   It's a magic.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.800]   That's not a real fire, is it?
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   It's a magic evening.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   Would I avoid sticking my hand at it like I am right now if it wasn't a real fire?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.800]   That's exactly right.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   He's learned once burned twice shy.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   And we plugged the cruise, right?
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   Joko Cruise Crazy, everybody should go there.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   That's kind of strange life of its own.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   That is something.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   The wait.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   It's not merely going back and forth.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   There's actually a little shapes of thing in there.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   It's having spasms.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   That's a little...
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   I love that you've left a little plastic hanger tag on in the back.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   Well, you can return it after the show and they can put it right back on the rack.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   Everything goes back at the end of the show.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   As you can see, the wreath, 50% off.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   Or we could just sell it here if you want.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   I have other hats, so that one's a little strange.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   There you go.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   Good price on that wreath, I think.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   That's a nice wreath.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:24.800]   So you guys did a tour, Paul and Storm last year, that was just a spectacular tour with...
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   What did you call that?
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   Adam Savage on it.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   You had...
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   Yes.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   Wootstock.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   Wootstock.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   Yes.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   Now, is that done?
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   Are you going to do that again?
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   No.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   We actually have a couple more coming.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   Because I think we're doing one.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   Go ahead.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   Will Wheaton was part of that, right?
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.800]   Yeah, it's a variety...
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   Go ahead, Storm.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   Oh, sure.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   It's sort of a geek vaudeville show that you...
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   Oh, I love that.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   Not minstrel, though.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   There's no blackface involved to Storm.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   No.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   No.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   Sometimes, not anymore.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   Not in the world.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   That's just the lower part of this black.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   Right.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   This...
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   No tea is actually shoe polish.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   It's true.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   But it's not blackface.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   Right.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   But yeah, it pops up like mushrooms throughout the year.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   We have one scheduled for San Francisco, actually.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   I don't know if the public...
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   Oh, good.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   The announced...
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   Or catch.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   Go ahead.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   It's not super-officially official, but it's basically official.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   We did one at Comic-Con last year, and it went really well, and we're going to go back again this year.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   No, that's...
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   And also...
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   That's San Francisco's...
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   Comic-Con's in San Diego.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   San Diego's.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   San Francisco's a different place.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   We are doing San Francisco on January 29th.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   We're calling it Founders Night.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   It's just four of us.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   There won't be any sort of main guest plot.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   That's a little tough thing.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   Thanks, my great.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   I'll be there.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   I'll be there.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   I'll be there.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   You couldn't get anybody else to go, so it's Founders Night.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   No, we couldn't...
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   Oh, we were too cheap to spring for guests on that particular show.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   Last year, you were at the Italian-American friendship hall in San Francisco, right?
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   I think that's where...
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   Swedish-American.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   Swedish-American.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   Some for us.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   Will you be reaching out again to our Scandinavian friends this year?
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   No, this one would be...
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   We'd be like to buy the parties with the Marines.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   The Marines.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   The Marines' Memorial Theater.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   That's a good venue, actually.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   That's a nice big venue.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.800]   Yeah, it's part of a sketch fest.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   Oh, good.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   Are you going to be out there right around then as well, I believe?
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   Is that correct, Mr. Hodgman?
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   I will be there.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   But as you know, the San Francisco Sketch Fest runs basically from January 19th until the next January 19th.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.800]   There's a sketch fest in the coming months.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   It's a long, long, long, long, long.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   It's a huge big, incredible cornucopia of Ha-ha.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   I will only be in the city by the bay from the 19th until the 23rd, taking part in a number
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   of things, including my own personal one man with maybe some fun guests show on the 20th.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   Well, tell us about that.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   You do a one man show now?
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   Is that something new?
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   Yeah, well, you know, with Jonathan and with Paul and Storm, at times I've always gone and presented material from complete world knowledge.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   And it evolved over the years from basically a book reading to more of standing up and talking.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   I won't call it stand-up comedy, but I'm certainly standing up most of the time unless I'm sitting down taking my shoes off and talking and presenting material from the book.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   And in fact, Paul and Storm and I are doing it together in FET.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   What are we doing at the birch meringue?
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   February 10th, I think.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   February 10th, right?
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   That's what I...
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   Yeah, we're going to do that together in February 10th, the birch meringue.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   And I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   And that's Alexandria, Virginia.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   Awesome.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   But I'm sorry that I'm going to miss your Founder's Night Woodstock.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   That sounds good.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.800]   Who else is in who are the other two of the Founders Night?
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   Well, it's well-written and the Savage.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   Along with us, those are the Founders.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   There will be other folks, but it's not going to be a like a five to six hour woodstock.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   Like the usual area.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   Really? Are they that long?
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   Well, the Pirates lament takes up two or three hours.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   These shows are legendary, legendary length.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   You've never seen a show quite as long as a woodstock.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   I was very carefully phrased there, Jonathan.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   There was no praise whatsoever in that.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   It was very sort of a long...
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   Long as I didn't know...
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   I didn't know music like that was possible.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   Especially the one where Jonathan was the co-host.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   That one in particular...
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   How much is a cabinet woodstock?
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   A cabinet cheaper than the cruise, I'll tell you what.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   But they last as long as the cruise.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   I don't remember what ticket.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   I think tickets are something like $35 for the...
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   If you have to ask, you can't afford it.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   You shouldn't. They should be no...
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   Right. Just show up.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   Just show up.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   The longest five hours of my life says Curtis B.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   And that's just the last song.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   I wish there were some...
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   We tried this before and you can't do it.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   Because of the laggins kite that we could get them to do,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.800]   the pirates lament or something like that.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   But you can't because they don't match up.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   Maybe next year, could we all be together?
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   Can we just plan it?
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   We could do it every year.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   I would love that.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   I've never heard of that.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   I've never heard of that.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   Maybe you said it when I wasn't listening.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Well, maybe you were planning to get together without me.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   Was that it?
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   Oh, I...
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   We're actually all in San Francisco right now.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   John.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   Guys, we can hear you over the bleed.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   Tom Merritt is right over there.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   Somebody's hand is reaching into the fire.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   This is terrifying.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   That's a good one.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   That was one of my early jobs.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   Really?
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   Fire stoker?
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   John Hodgman, fire stoker.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   You're a fire stoker.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   You're a fire stoker.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   You're a fire stoker.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   You're a fire stoker.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   You're a uni?
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   Well, it's all part.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   It's SAG-AFTRA.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   It's not the International Association.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   Your F is for fire?
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   You guys, that's where I forget the books and the audio tapes.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   I just made $1,000 for that one shot.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   Stoker.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   And you guys got a pair of me too.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   You guys got a pay me $10,000 now because you showed it on your,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   whatever this is, Internet television.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   I do think that's where the term, he was stoked comes from.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   Yeah, of course.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   But isn't this all getting so commercial guys?
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   Here we are, plugging our things, plugging each other's things.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   Talking about how much money I'm making from that one stoking
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   commercial I did so long ago.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   What is the season all about?
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   What is this?
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   Look at what you got there.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   You got all that stuff.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   Booze.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   What am I drinking?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   Yeah, I, since I do not drink Yagermeister, I am drinking three
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   IBC Blackery sodas.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   That's not one of them hard.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   I'm having a drink, isn't it?
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   No, it's just a soda.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   No, it's just a plain old soda.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   Oh, it's a zebra.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   Yeah, it's not because this is, look at how fancy it is there now.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   Remember when this all, remember it last year?
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   It used to be in a tiny, tiny garret room.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   And now we've got a fire, a fire stoker.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   It was just people sitting on Skype getting drunk together.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   I mean, that's when the Internet was good, right?
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   That's what Christmas is all about.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   That's what happened.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   That is still happening.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   That is still happening.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   Jonathan's cardboard box.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   Jonathan's cardboard box has moved three feet.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   Can we get that shot of him?
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   Is it moving?
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   Is this moving?
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   Oh, no, I just missed the last one.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   That was a first one.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   It is.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   This is last year.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   This is last year.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   Take a look now.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   Take a look now.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   This is last year.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   Okay, now let's see where it is this year.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   It's moved over through through through through through through.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   And the underwear is no longer on it.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   So that's good.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   You know what?
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   You know what?
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   We're making progress at Colton headquarters.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   You're making progress.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   In a couple of years, those boxes are going to be all the way over there.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   Now did you have to take any outside funding for that box move?
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   No, I actually did it.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   I did it myself.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   I'm a very DIY kind of guy because the thing is, if you hire somebody to do it, they want
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   40%.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   You know, and that's not I'm not willing to pay it.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   No way.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   I did it myself.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   It was I didn't do it very well, obviously, but.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   What are you stabbing there?
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   Well, he sold the underwear that was hanging out of the box last year to hire a couple of
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   guys to move it just that far.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   I give you this underwear.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   I'll give you this underwear if you push this box three feet.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   I love the job of underwear.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   Which as I recall, I thought we thought was like his buffalo bill murder sack.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   Can we?
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   Can we say that?
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   It was not underwear.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   It was not underwear.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   It was just some dirty rags.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   That's underwear.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   That's not underwear.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   If you wear dirty rags, it's underwear.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   That's disgusting.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   Oh my God.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   I see you've mounted your platinum cassette tape from chant above your.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   I have a very proud of that.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   That was the number one.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   Let me go get a tape of Gregorian chance from 1996 or something.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   Is that American?
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   You just love him platinum.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   Where I think you're going to go like 10.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.800]   Gregorian chick from 1996 is my movie cover band.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   I was waiting for someone to wait a minute.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   Where the hell did you get that?
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   Wait, he earned it.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   He earned it.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   He earned it.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   He earned it.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   To Jonathan Colton to commemorate the sale.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   Of more than two million copies.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   Wow.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   What did you have to do with that album, Jonathan?
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   How did you sell to two million copies?
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   I had to take a vow of silence for about six years.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   According to Amazon, this one album has sort more copies.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.800]   Of Gregorian chance than all other Gregorian albums put together.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   You know, I'll tell you what happened when I first moved to New York City and was trying
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   to figure out how to be a rock star.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   I thought it'd be a good idea to get a job at a record company just to get involved with
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   the business.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   So I got a job as the assistant to somebody at this record company called Angel Records.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Which is a very good company.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   I mean, that's a big company.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   It was a big company.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   At the time that I was working for them, it was a division of EMI.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   They did classical music and crossover, adult content.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   They did all sorts of stuff.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   But when I arrived, they were riding the wave of this incredible phenomenon called "Chant",
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   which was essentially a 20 year old recording of some Spanish monks singing playing champs.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   They had re-released as a single disc.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   It was a double album.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   They released it as a single disc with that fancy cover of the monks floating in the blue
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   sky.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   And it sold 2 million copies.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   And nobody really knew why.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   And it was the kind of crazy, it was the craziest introduction to the record business.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   Because it was like, "Hey, you wrote some pop songs.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.800]   Great.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   Here's this 20 year old recording of some Spanish monks that accidentally sold 2 million copies."
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   See what you can do, kid.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   See what you can do with that.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   And this is what piracy can take away from us.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   I knew it to do with that thing.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   Because it didn't have.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   And make them float in the sky.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   I knew it was wrong.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   I knew it was wrong with that thing.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   And I fixed it.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   The Amazon.com description says, "Thanks to good marketing, good cover and good luck.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   This disc has probably sold more copies than most other recordings of Gregorian Champ put
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   together.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   It's often quipped that most of these discs has been listened to exactly once and put
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   away to the puzzlement of many musicians and critics who point out, "There are more beautiful.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   There are more varied performances by professional singers available."
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   If this recording, I don't know.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   I've never heard Amazon editorialize like this.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   If this recording, a hem, enchants you at first, wonderful.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   If you get bored with it later, don't give up.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   There have been an extraordinary variety of styles and sounds over the 1500-year history
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   of plain chant.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   So go listen to some other stuff.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   You won't be sorry.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   So suddenly they're shilling Gregorian chant because something became popular.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   I probably bought this.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   I hate to say it.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   I know it was in our house.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   Well, at the height of insanity, the president of the label came into one of the weekly meetings
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   and told a story.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   He said he went down to Tower Records, which was a store where they sold records.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   Those were the days.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   Those were the days, yeah.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   He went to check out where it was placed in the store and sort of see what was happening.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   He was just sort of loitering around.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:02.280]   He saw somebody go up to the counter and ask the person, "Hey, do you have that record
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   chant?" and the person behind the counter said, "We're actually sold out right now, but
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   we will be getting some in a couple of days."
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   And the guy said, "Oh, fantastic, because I really need it.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   I really need it.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   By the way, what is it?"
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.280]   I really need it.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.280]   It's kind of like, "Hey, is what you're saying?"
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.280]   Exactly.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:29.720]   That was exactly what the label president wanted to hear, is that people were buying it even
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.240]   though they had no idea what it was.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.240]   That's what the internet has taken away from us.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   Well, Jonathan does have a new album.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.240]   Jonathan does have a new album.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.240]   We're going to talk about that in just a little bit and where to get it.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   As the plug fest continues, maybe a little later on we'll get to the spirit of Christmas.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   Just, you know.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.240]   I doubt it.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.240]   Probably not.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   It's a thought.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   We're aimed at that.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:42:00.760]   But I do want to talk a little bit about Ford Motor Company and something that, you know,
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.760]   it's hard to take seriously with these guys back here behind me making faces.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.960]   But especially since your fire seems to have suddenly been reduced to the size of a YouTube
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.960]   video.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   But, guess what?
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.960]   It's still warm though.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.680]   We're going to restart the fire.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   Can we restart the fire?
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.680]   Meanwhile...
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   We don't restart the fire.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   That's a really joke.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.440]   Wait, here comes a super eight-bit fireplace.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.440]   This will be nice.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.440]   Well, there you go.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   No, that's better.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440]   Nice.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.440]   That is warming.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.440]   Warming, warming.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.920]   Meanwhile, let's take a ride in the Ford vehicles.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.040]   I think this was the focus that we had last week and show you a little bit about how WiFi
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.600]   works in these new 2012 Ford Focuses.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.680]   Take a look.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.520]   So we're back at the Twits Brick House and I have a volunteer.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.000]   Michael here is going to...
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.480]   Well, Michael here is...
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.480]   Michael, Michael.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.560]   See, when you go on a long car trip, nice to have something for the kids to do.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.920]   I brought a little laptop.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.920]   I got my iPhone.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.440]   He's got his iPad.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.760]   But what about the WiFi?
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   Oh, no problem.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:09.640]   I brought along my WiFi access spot, AKA my Ford Focus.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.480]   So Michael, hop in here.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.040]   You get in that side.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.040]   I'm going to get in this side.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.920]   I'm going to show you how I can use this USB WiFi dongle or 3G dongle to turn this into
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:26.680]   a WiFi access spot.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.960]   When you travel with kids, as you know, it's really nice to have some entertainment for
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   them.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.960]   They like to get online.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:37.040]   Maybe they want to surf the web or do a little email, play some games.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.320]   Ford's realized that getting connected inside your car is a big deal.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.760]   That's why they have added WiFi access capability to the 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   Let me show you how it works.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.160]   I take this...
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.840]   This is a Virgin mobile, but a lot of companies make these.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.560]   It's a USB 3G transmitter.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.360]   Normally you plug this into the computer and the computer is online, but what if we have
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   more than one device?
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:03.560]   We can get up to five devices online, but plugging this into the Focus, that is going
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.720]   to turn the whole car into an access spot.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.440]   So now Michael can put his iPad on the WiFi in the car.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.160]   I can put my iPhone on the WiFi and the WiFi in the car.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.160]   Up to five devices.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   I even have one of these Google Chromebooks, which likes having a little WiFi so it can
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.460]   get online.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.460]   And here I go.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.760]   I just connect it up.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.360]   I'm in the WiFi access spot.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.000]   Pick it, put in the password, and I'm online.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I love this.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.840]   As we drive down the highway, everybody's happy.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.560]   Thank you, Ford.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:40.520]   One of the many nice features in the Ford Focus for 2012 and of course, available on
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.520]   other Ford vehicles.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.760]   Why don't you go to your Ford dealer and drive one today?
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.440]   Or visit the website, Ford.com/technology.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.200]   You ready to go?
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   All right.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.200]   Let's hit the road.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.440]   Michael never said one word that whole time.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   It didn't.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   It didn't.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440]   It's just bad.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.440]   Well, there you go.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.280]   Because under sag, you would have had to pay him.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   Exactly.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   John, you knew.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.360]   You knew what was wrong.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.040]   So this is kind of exciting.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.240]   This is your eighth studio album, Jonathan Colton.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.720]   And John Flansburg, fellow Brooklyn, I produced this.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.080]   How did that happen?
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.880]   Of they might be John?
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.880]   Of they might be giants.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   Yes.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.640]   I've been a fan of theirs for a long time.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.720]   I met them in person a couple of times probably through John
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:28.240]   Hodgeman, who of course was the deranged millionaire when they did the venue songs thing.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:33.920]   And I had been the guy creepily hanging around backstage at a couple of shows.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:41.520]   And then Paul and Storm and I did the show in Chicago that was scheduled opposite.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.160]   They might be Giants Show also in Chicago the same night and they were doing flood.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   Oh boy.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.680]   It would be fun to do our own flood show.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.840]   So we actually learned the entire album.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:52.840]   Oh my God.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.640]   And the three of us played it.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.400]   And I wrote a plans for email to Flansburg to make sure they weren't going to be angry
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   at us for doing that.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   Like doing steel all their fans.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   Exactly.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:09.160]   And I, you know, at some point after that they asked me to open for them, which I did
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   for a few shows.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.680]   And at the end of that run, John Flansburg approached me and said, hey, you know, if
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.080]   you, what are you doing right now?
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.720]   And maybe we should maybe we should make an album together.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.920]   So he was the producer on this record.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   Wow.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   That's cool.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.560]   It was really it was it was great.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.680]   It was a great experience and it's kind of a dream come true.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.440]   You know, it's a keep, keep having to pinch myself.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.920]   Had you worked with the producer before?
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.120]   I mean, you've done it all yourself, haven't you?
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:42.480]   I have done it all myself in my home studio and, you know, was it was so great because
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:49.560]   I've been rattling around inside my own head for so long that it was really nice to share
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.240]   some of the burden with somebody else and to collaborate with somebody and to to be able
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.200]   to say yes to other people's ideas instead of just my ideas.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.560]   So it was a really, really fulfilling experience and a lot of fun.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:08.640]   And I hope we'll I hope we'll do more songs like just we Rick Springfield.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:18.280]   Sucker punch and the stash, which I I'm sure is in honor of Mr. Hodgman's.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.960]   It might it might as well be.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.840]   I I am such a fan of that mustache.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:31.480]   You know, I know that if you if you are used to Hodgman without the mustache and then you
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.320]   see a picture, God, look at that.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   That's remarkable.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.320]   Do you wax?
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.320]   Do you wax that, John?
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.320]   No.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:45.280]   It just has natural masculine texture.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:52.120]   If you if you twirl it enough, you might as well have waxed it because the oil from
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.280]   your hands has filled it with grease.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:59.000]   Yes, everything that is wrong with me has been fixed by this mustache.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.880]   And I was you know, I it took me on the law.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.880]   Oh, there you go.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.880]   Problem solved.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.880]   You're hitting the crystal head.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.880]   All right.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:11.600]   Christmas future for you.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.320]   You know, I think that when you wear the red band, it looks like you're about to run
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.320]   the bulls at Pamplona.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.160]   Running the bulls in Williams.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.280]   Yeah, well, it's the running of the baristas.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.360]   The running of the baristas.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.360]   I like it.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:32.160]   Well, if all the hipsters in Williamsburg just started wearing riding horses around all
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.560]   the time, that was the trend.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.440]   It became like the Wild West.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.840]   And instead of fixed gear bicycles, it just started riding horses.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:48.600]   And I had to like before going to to drink at their local watering hole, they had to tie
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.280]   up their horse at their hitching post.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.280]   And if they all had handlebar mustaches, the picture would be complete.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.120]   Well, they already have they already do have the handlebar mustaches.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.440]   They all they all look like bartenders in an old time.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.600]   He salooned the begin with.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   So they should ride some horses.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.360]   I think you're right.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:14.280]   So according to Wikipedia, Jonathan, you performed many of these songs live before the
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:19.520]   album was released and fans compiled a bootleg called artificial artificial heart before
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   the studio album.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   Is that true?
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.160]   That's right.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.160]   They did.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.160]   Yeah, that's sort of classic classic Jonathan Colton fan activity.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.320]   They stole from me.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:39.960]   I love being for the soap act.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.960]   I do believe that he's the soap supporter, aren't you?
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   I think you are.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.960]   He's a so I love I love this.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.960]   It's like I love sofa.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   You know why?
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   Because it protects it protects.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.320]   I can't even do it.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   I can't even do it.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.320]   I can't even do it.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   You can't do it.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.840]   I can't even come with with come up with a reason why it might be good.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.320]   It protects us from secure DNS.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   That's right.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.320]   We don't need IP sec.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.320]   Who does?
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.120]   No, actually protects us from free speech in many ways you are.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.480]   Yes, free speech can be very unsettling.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.560]   It is dangerous.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.680]   In many ways you are the poster child for somebody who doesn't hold on tight to what
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.160]   he makes and yet is able to make a living selling it unaccountably given that anything
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:25.840]   that you have done is available for free pretty much everywhere.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:33.560]   Honestly, people really do want to support the artists that they like.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.760]   I feel this way.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:42.080]   I'm sure that everybody who bought artificial artificial art bought artificial art as well.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:47.720]   Well, I'm sure because they are different versions.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.160]   And they're fans, exactly.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.240]   And they know they understand the transaction.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.120]   They understand that if they spend money on the music, it makes it more likely for me
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.760]   to have money to make the next batch of music that I need to make.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.080]   It just makes sense.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.480]   And artificial artificial art.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.880]   You reach an audience that is so large, Jonathan, that they're not going to have that direct
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.920]   connection with you anymore.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.360]   And that's when they start stealing from you.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.320]   When they don't understand that their money is going directly to you and they just pretend,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.720]   "Oh, yeah, he's going to be successful no matter what."
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.080]   Is that what's happened to you, Jon Hodgman?
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.000]   No, I never had the first thing.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   So I don't know why.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   And actually, you know what, I don't mean to accuse Jonathan or anything.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.320]   I think that it's really interesting how scalable it is.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.520]   I may have been more skeptical, but Jonathan's audience is getting larger and larger.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.520]   I think it's scale.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:41.480]   And I think what happens is that while you can't necessarily keep the direct kind of like
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:46.400]   I'm answering every email relationship that you have with fans at the beginning of a
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:51.080]   career that really gets them invested in the career and gets them feeling connected, there
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:57.520]   is something that's great about independent music and writing and other distribution on
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.040]   the internet, which is that people are beginning to get savvy and understand that the dollar
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:06.040]   that they spend on that piece of work that you have put out yourself is going to go to
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.040]   you.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.760]   And the place where they get calluses when they realize that 90% of that dollar is going
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.240]   to go to an international corporation that doesn't care about it.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.240]   I agree.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.080]   And at that point, they're like, "I might as well steal this."
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.680]   I mean, you look at the example of Louis C.K.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.720]   And he's got a massive audience.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:31.760]   And he just did this $5 comedy special that was also available for people to get for free.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.400]   And so he posted the numbers and they were enormous.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   He made it into hell.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   They're up even more now.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.520]   They're $750,000 he's made so far.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:43.720]   I would argue that people actually don't even see it as stealing.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.040]   It's not a vengeful thing in a lot of cases.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.920]   It's just the way the internet is.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.640]   And so if they have a direct connection, they're like, "Oh, I'm going to get a little
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   right."
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.880]   "Oh, well, hey, I want Jonathan to make more stuff.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.520]   So how can I-- I'm going to investigate how to support him?
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.480]   But if it's other people that they see as millionaires are part of the system, they don't
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   feel a responsibility to have to dig in."
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.680]   Tamir, and I really want to--
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   That's stealing, though.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   That's stealing.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.480]   I mean, let's be fair.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:10.360]   If someone thinks that they're too rich to not notice what you're taking from them, that's
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.360]   stealing.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.640]   Well, I'm saying that they're not doing it vengefully.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.760]   You could argue the semantics of whether it's stealing or not.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.760]   But I don't think people think of it.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   Oh, I see this.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.080]   I think they just go do it.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:25.480]   Yeah, somebody-- I can't remember who it was who posted this, but somebody posted something
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.680]   interesting about a comment that you see a lot on YouTube.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.120]   And you can kind of tell it's like 12 or 13-year-old kids who are writing this.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:40.040]   They'll post a video that's a static photo of an album cover with a song.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:46.840]   And they'll say, in the description, they'll say, "No copyright infringement intended,"
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.840]   which is like--
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.840]   We did it.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.840]   It's like when somebody--
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   It's not--
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.400]   It's like when somebody says, "No offense, but you're an ignorant whore."
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.120]   It's like, "No offense, okay."
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.120]   But--
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   Right.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   Well, and the good interesting thing about it is that's how people think of it.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.440]   When they say that, what they mean is, this is not really infringing anything.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.440]   This is totally cool.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   This happens all the time.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   We're trying to find it.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.440]   They're trying to find it.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   We're trying to find it.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.320]   We're not trying to take money away from anyone when we do this.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:20.280]   And it's very likely that nobody would listen to that in lieu of if they wanted the track,
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   buying the track.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.920]   Now I do have to say, one of the negatives of artificial artificial art, the fan bootleg,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.840]   is it is missing the critical, just-we-rig spring field cut.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.480]   So you have to buy the actual album.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:39.440]   I actually bought the deluxe artificial heart, which gets me T-shirts.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.440]   That's awesome.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.960]   I think a tapas plate made by Jonathan, and all kinds of stuff.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.440]   You know what I'd be more offended by?
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.840]   And I actually want to ask you about this, Jonathan, is that I don't have to buy it.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.560]   I listen to it on Spotify.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:56.040]   You get anything if I listen to it on Spotify?
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:04.240]   Spotify is a terrible side effect of enormous labels.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:12.320]   What has happened is that Spotify negotiated with the big labels because they need that
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:17.080]   content in their library, and they were sort of over a barrel.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:25.920]   And so they had to give a specific decent rent to those big labels at the expense of
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.320]   everybody else in the world.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.200]   So when you listen to my music on Spotify, if you play my own Spotify-
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.880]   Almost all of it's there.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.880]   Almost all of it's there.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:41.880]   If you, one spin of one of my songs on Spotify, I think earns me 0.007 cents.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:48.120]   Whereas if you're on a major label, I think you get three cents.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.120]   It's an enormous disparity.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:58.920]   So yeah, Spotify is not great for the entire ecosystem of independent musicians.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:04.320]   I think people need to know that because I think that people believe or understand that
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.840]   if I listen to Jonathan Colton on YouTube with a still of him, "Okay, he's not getting
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.040]   any money out of that.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.960]   That's not really supporting Jonathan."
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.160]   But I'm listening to it on a legitimate service like Spotify.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.320]   There it is, artificial heart, including just Sweet Rick Springfield.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.240]   And well, that must be legitimate.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   It's got the album art.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.720]   It's got his name.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.240]   So I think you need to...
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.960]   People need to get the word out that...
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:32.280]   Well, it is legitimate.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.440]   It's my decision whether or not to have it there and I choose to have it there.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   That's interesting.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   Why?
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.480]   Well, I think that...
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:45.600]   Well, first of all, I'm always willing to experiment with these things.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:49.720]   Nobody knows how long services like Spotify are going to last.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:55.600]   I mean, it's still unclear if they're going to be a viable business the way they can actually
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.560]   make money doing this.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   So...
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.360]   But it's also...
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:05.240]   I recognize that it's a big place that people go to discover music as well as listen to
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.000]   music.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:14.800]   And so I operate under the theory that if you listen to my music for free, it can only
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.040]   benefit me down the line because you'll come to a show, you'll buy a t-shirt, you'll
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:27.080]   buy the fancy super fancy box that Tom Merritt bought somewhere down the road.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.640]   Because some degree, I don't mean to interrupt you, Jonathan, but I feel like you've discovered
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:35.800]   another thing that I never would have been able to predict, which is if you are a sole
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:40.400]   proprietor putting your stuff out there, you, like an old-fashioned record album, are going
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:46.160]   to have to presume a certain amount of theft, of loss, of people taking it for free who aren't
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.520]   going to give you the money.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:51.480]   And therefore, you give an opportunity to people who are really committed to your career
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.680]   to buy something premium that you're willing to give them, in this case, the box of stuff
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.680]   and everything else.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:05.200]   I think part of the system as well, or part of the new math as well, is that there's...
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   What is the new math?
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   Gotta be...
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   No!
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.200]   ...of the premium level.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   Ugh!
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.760]   By the way, every time John Hadron freezes, we all have a drink of Jaeger.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   That's, I believe, the game.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   Is that right?
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   Or Crystal Head.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.760]   I want to know the secret he...
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:21.760]   It doesn't matter.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.760]   Right.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.480]   It isn't that important.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:29.560]   It's not... nobody really needs to know that.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   I'll tell you what I need to know.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.200]   And then we're going to let John go because he's got...
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.640]   We have an out, hard out time for John.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:42.400]   You have a video, and I want to play it a little later on Funny or Die, for the book
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:48.000]   That Is All, which is your new tome that's third in the trilogy of the entire world's
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   knowledge.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   And in that video...
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   I think you said it's accurate.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   Pardon me?
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.280]   Everything you've said is accurate.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   Thank you.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:58.440]   I'd like to have the continued reassurance as I go because there will be many more facts,
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   and I don't want it.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.760]   It would be hard to go back and repair them all.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:05.040]   So just as I go, if I say anything wrong, just let me know.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:11.080]   You have in the video a surprisingly large number of very famous people, and they're
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:14.360]   all sitting in a room in your mansion.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   Yes.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.480]   How did you get those people to do that?
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.680]   They don't even get much time on camera.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.120]   They're there for like that.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:30.960]   Well, the video was directed by Tom Sharpling, who is a brilliant comedian and a really brilliant
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.360]   broadcaster.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.600]   He does a radio show.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.280]   In fact, that's where I'm going tonight.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:41.680]   He does a live terrestrial radio show on WFMU in Jersey City called The Best Show on
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.880]   WFMU.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.440]   And it's podcast, and you must look it up.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   That was pissed off the wrestling guy.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.440]   It was on WFMU No-End.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.440]   No, but they know.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   They know.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.440]   They know.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.440]   Wow.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.440]   It is the best show.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:57.600]   Tom is a comic genius who hosts this amazing call-in show where people call in, and every
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:02.120]   night he just interacts with people in the most amazing, hilarious way, and characters
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.800]   emerge, and it's terrific.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.840]   And he sells comedy albums with his partner, John Worster, who is the drummer in the band
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.520]   Superchunk under the label Sharpling and Worster, and he also is a director of music
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.600]   videos.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.960]   So I had this idea to do a video using this song by They Might Be Giants based on this
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.240]   character that we created for one of their previous projects, The Duranged Millionaire.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.440]   And Tom was the director, and he had this idea since celebrity cameos are becoming so
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.320]   common in music videos and book trailers and that sort of thing.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.000]   He said, "We should get everyone we know.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.320]   Just reach out and ask every favor.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.560]   We've ever, you know, cash in on every favor we've ever done."
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:51.000]   And get as many famous people as possible and put them in one room and just have the
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.720]   camera scan by them such that your character, The Duranged Millionaire doesn't even care
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.840]   that Brooke Shields ends, and Jack McBrayer and Scott Adson, John Lutz from 30 Rock, and
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.080]   Questlove from The Roots, and Vernon Reed from Living Color, and Dick Cavett, and Justin
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.640]   Long, and all sorts of other incredible people who gave their time up to just sit there and
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.920]   have the camera just waft over them briefly.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.520]   It was one of those amazing things.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:21.440]   I realize we can't, in fact, play it because if we do, Funny or Die will pull this entire
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.440]   show off the air.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.440]   Is that true?
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.440]   Yes, it is true, unfortunately.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.640]   I didn't think it was supposed to be exclusive anymore to Funny or Die.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.720]   That exclusivity is going to go away, and I'm going to look into it and make sure that
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:41.880]   you have a special permission from me, The Duranged Millionaire, to show this thing as
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.920]   much as crazy as possible.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   That's all I need from you, John Hotman.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.080]   We will, for that reason, we will append it shortly after the commercial, which is impending.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.760]   And I'm going to let you go because you have to go to the best show, a better show than
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.760]   this show, in fact.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.760]   No, no, not the least.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.560]   I wish I could sit around here and talk to you about the important things about distribution
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.520]   of self-produced content over the internet.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.440]   We got a little serious there, and it was really a lull, so I want to move on.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.600]   That is all is the book.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.640]   It is available now, get it on Audible, get the other books on Audible, and get this book
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.560]   at Amazon or better bookstores, where in fact it has been remandered in this cheap right
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.680]   now, only half the cost of other books.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   Is that right?
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.320]   Well, they have it on sale along with a lot of other books.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.320]   Okay.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   I'm just going to--
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.320]   It came out at the same time as mine.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.680]   Oh, he's a little defensive now.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   Or 50%.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   Well, I don't want to say that it's been remandered.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.680]   It has not been remandered.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.480]   You're not going to buy it for $2.99 at the Strand.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.480]   That will be next week.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.040]   But they did tear the front cover off, right?
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.520]   Yes, they threw it in the dumpster, yeah.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.800]   It has been spindled and we love it.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.560]   John Hudson, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560]   Thanks, you.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.440]   Areas of my expertise.com.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440]   We will get--
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:09.480]   Merry Christmas to you, Ray
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480]   and welcome to the Strand.com.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.880]   Just down the road a piece from you guys in beautiful Manhattan.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.000]   They have a lovely office there.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.560]   I just made a Squarespace site while we were sitting here.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560]   Did you?
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.560]   What's it called?
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.560]   It's goonjococruse.squarespace.com.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.720]   It's probably a better app for the crews than we just heard.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.560]   I did it on my iPad while we were talking.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.800]   Wow.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   So the idea--
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   It was a mistake.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   I did it.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   I just did something.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.800]   It was stupid.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   You put candy in your mouth while you were trying to do an ad.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.240]   I started a commercial.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.840]   And then I couldn't resist the candy made by none of the Mississippi.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.840]   It's not even it.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.320]   It was like slow motion.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   No.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.680]   It's not a good idea.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.120]   These are very hard to eat fast.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120]   But they're tasty.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.680]   What are you talking about Squarespace?
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.720]   Go on jococruse.squarespace.com if we can get that up.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.280]   Essentially, like I said, I made it on my iPad.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.680]   So you can just sit on an iPad.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.280]   That's pretty amazing that you did that.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.520]   And make a website like that.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.920]   No credit card required.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   Nothing.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.480]   It looks professional.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   It looks quality.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.880]   I'm not saying the writing is great, but that's all to me.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.280]   That applies to Squarespace.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.760]   You misspelled sandwich for one thing.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.000]   No, that's an alternative.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   No, I--
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   That's easy to fix.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   Actually, that must be auto correct.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   All right.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   That's how iOS--
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   No, I--
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   I misspelled sandwich.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.800]   It says, "More reasons to go on the cruise.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.280]   You can order a sandwich delivered to your room any time of the day, possibly delivered
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.480]   by a monkey butler."
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.480]   Possibly.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.480]   I'm not guaranteeing that.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.640]   We're not saying this is the most beautiful site I've ever seen.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   No.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.640]   Clean.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.600]   That is a blog page.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.520]   You can add media to your post.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.520]   So yeah, but you know, I threw it together quickly on an iPad.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.560]   Imagine what you can do if you actually mean to make a site.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560]   Were you bored?
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.560]   Is that why you did that?
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.560]   I mean, I just--
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.560]   I wanted to--
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560]   That's awesome.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560]   --put the cruise again.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560]   That's really great.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.560]   And the monkey boat.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.560]   And the--
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.560]   And the--
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560]   And the--
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.560]   And the--
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.560]   And the--
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.560]   And the--
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560]   And the--
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.560]   And the--
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.560]   And the--
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.560]   But yeah, I mean, I could go in here and I could make all kinds of posts.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.560]   It looks better on my iPad, frankly.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560]   Look at that.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560]   That's it.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.560]   I made the name of the site.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560]   There it is.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   Try it free.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.680]   You just need the name, password, and email.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.040]   Now if you decide after two weeks-- and you get all the features, by the way, the-- you
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.200]   could put the social media.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.120]   You could probably put their Twitter feeds in there.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.280]   Their Flickr account from the last cruise, put some of those pictures.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.360]   I mean, you could dress this up, obviously.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.800]   There's all sorts of nice features.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.680]   But if you decide after two weeks you want to keep it, easy.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   Squarespace.com.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.040]   You get a discount, from us.

[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.160]   TWIT12.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.160]   Hey, hey.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   Okay.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.160]   See, boy, use TWIT12.

[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.520]   And give it a try.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520]   We really-- these guys are great.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.520]   They've done a great job.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.160]   It's hosting plus the best software ever.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.160]   And you saw how easily that Tom did that even on an iPad.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.680]   They have great iPad software and Android software too for hosting.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:04.680]   Yeah, no, it's fantastic.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.040]   And this wasn't even the app.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.040]   This was just in the browser.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.440]   The app gives you all kinds of other qualities that you can use, like adding different kinds
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.040]   of widgets and Twitter feeds.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.960]   So we have taken-- this is amazing.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:17.960]   The technology.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.640]   It sounds like the elves got into the Jaeger, I think.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.400]   Storm is putting that as 10 a cup.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.440]   He had gone out to beg earlier.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.440]   The amazing technology we have.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.440]   I have my Jaeger bowl.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.000]   Oh, that's where the ice is.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.640]   It is so important, I think.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.640]   To ice your Jaeger.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.040]   Traditionally Jaeger bowl of-- it is every year.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.740]   We break out the Jaeger bowl.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:47.780]   If we almost press and I go-- wait, which way?
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.780]   [HUMMING]
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:50.780]   Oh, no.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.780]   Oh, no.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:52.780]   You have the rights for that.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:53.780]   [HUMMING]
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:58.280]   It's a beautiful night, and they call it Belanote.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.280]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.280]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   It's good.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.640]   You playing that on the Jaeger bottle?
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.640]   No.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   I don't know what's happening.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.640]   It's a point--
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640]   It's a point--
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   You're cut off.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640]   You're cut off.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   You're just being pointy.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640]   That's all.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640]   That's beautiful.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   Oh, everyone's got one.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.640]   Do you have one in the box, Jonathan?
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640]   Ooh.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.640]   Ooh.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   Ooh, that's neat.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   What is that?
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   Can we get--
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   Can we get the two shots?
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.640]   Storm, stop playing for a second.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.640]   We'll be closer to our families.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.640]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640]   Nice for this.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   Oh, OK, because they're all deck classes.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   There we go.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   No, no.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   It's really closer.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   All right, we got--
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   I'm going to make one face.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.440]   OK, one nose, only one nose.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.440]   There you go.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.440]   What?
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.440]   How?
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.440]   Closer.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   [HUMMING]
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.440]   Storm is taking up all the face.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.440]   Coming closer.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.440]   High concept.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.440]   Closer.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.440]   Now where you're going.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.440]   I know where you're going with this.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   No, no.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.440]   Too close.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.440]   Nose in the middle.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.440]   Nose in the middle.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.440]   And you want--
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440]   There you go.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440]   There, now we're getting there.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.440]   And, of course, it works well because you guys all look the same.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.440]   Nose in the middle is my face's cover band, by the way.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.440]   Ooh, that's too tiring.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.440]   That's good.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.440]   Too much physical exertion for me.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.440]   I can't--
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.440]   [HUMMING]

[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   Multiple storms.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.440]   Boy, Hodg--
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.440]   Hodgeman leaves and it all goes to hell.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.440]   Yeah, was he really the restraining wall?
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440]   Yeah, he was.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.440]   He was.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.440]   He was.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.440]   You guys are all scared of him, aren't you?
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.440]   That's the truth.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.440]   A little bit.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.440]   Has artificial heart been selling well?
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   Has it been doing well?
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440]   It has.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.440]   You know, I did the presales thing with the box and the special editions and the signed
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   copies and everything.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:00.640]   So before it was even released, I sold enough to cover the expenses of the album and make
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.640]   a little bit of a profit.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   And then it's been selling really well.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:11.640]   You know, I hired a publicist and some more traditional stuff this time around just to
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.640]   see what would happen if you're a scientist.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.640]   Oh, interesting.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   Right.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:21.640]   And one of the interesting things that happened was my team said, "Hey, how come you don't--
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.640]   you don't have big numbers on SoundScan?"
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   And I said, "Yeah, I never report to SoundScan.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   I was the Nielsen company where the numbers come from for the billboard charts."
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.640]   And they said, "Well, you know, you should maybe report just to see what would happen
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   because if things line up with the touring and the shipping of presales and the release,
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.640]   you could get a relatively big number."
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   And it ended up actually charting on billboard, which was crazy.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   You make like three different charts.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   Well, yeah, it was the number one heat seeker one week, which--
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.640]   That's like--
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   That's like with a bullet.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   That's the bullet thing, right?
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.640]   That means it actually is looking to destroy humans.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:11.640]   It had targets a heat signature and tries to destroy it.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.640]   And then it was like number 23 on the album chart or something.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.640]   Wow.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.640]   It was sort of nuts.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.640]   And for me, it was kind of-- I don't know.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   I mean, I really just never had reported before because I figured, you know,
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   I wasn't going to make a dent there, but just because to show you how much the music industry
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640]   is kind of in the toilet right now.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   You know, I don't think so at all.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   When you said the newsletter explaining that, I had a revelation.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.640]   I'm like, I wonder how many other successful independent musicians are out there that aren't
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.640]   reporting to SoundScan.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   And what that would do to the total digital music number.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   Everybody says, "Oh, digital music's in the toilet.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   It's not making up the difference."
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.640]   I still don't think it would make up all the difference, but I think the sales would appear
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   stronger if we had better reporting.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   I think there's a lot of dark matter out there in terms of the economy of the music business.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.640]   You know, it's like who knows what's really happening?
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.640]   And that spotify-- the numbers in Spotify are a great example.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   I think that right now there's an overemphasis on the mainstream acts and the big label acts.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   Whereas there's a lot of actual economy happening in the independent space, and we just don't
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   see all of it, I think.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.640]   It's kind of an interesting point.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.640]   Paul, in Storm, do you participate in this kind of highly commercial activity?
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.640]   We're economying the crap out of the world right now.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.640]   Yes.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.640]   Yes.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   It's a sad, sad thing, isn't it?
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   How's that?
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.640]   I have living for about five-- what are you talking about?
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.640]   How's that Thanksgiving song doing?
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.640]   Do that do well was that the big hit of Thanksgiving this year, Rand?
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   It did do well for us.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.640]   It really did.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.640]   So we still have--
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:03.640]   We're not sure if it's reached George Lucas yet and had its real intended effect.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.640]   It had nothing to do with the commercial aspect.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   It was off.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.640]   It was restoring the Star Wars franchise.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   It was a very straight out of that.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.640]   It was a heat seeker.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.640]   For those of us who don't know what the hell you're talking about, what does Thanksgiving
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   have to do with George Lucas?
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.640]   Paul?
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   Well, the song was originally intended to be a semi-serious rumination, if you will, about
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.640]   Thanksgiving and the things that we are thankful for.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:41.640]   And it kept on circling back to asking whatever deity or deities are up there to tell George
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.640]   Lucas to stop effing with the trilogy.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   As we all agree, is the right thing to-- I think that's a high--
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   Right after so far.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.640]   Fight.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.640]   Gah, got a little technology.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.640]   Oh, Skype is just killing.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   I mean, it's Skype.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.640]   It's just destroying me here.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.640]   But anyway, yeah, so it just kept going back to that.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   I figured rather than try and fight that tendency one, I'd embrace it.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   And that's where the song came from, is it just--
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.640]   So how will you know--
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.640]   How will you know if it's achieved its effect?
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.640]   When the original Star Wars is released on Blu-ray without all of the edits.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   That's how we know.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   And you agree, Tom, that that is something to be devoutly--
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   Somebody right here, I remember who said in the chat room, "Oh, Gordon McCloud said it."
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   I don't mind if Lucas wants to change the trilogy to his heart's content, but give us access to the original versions as well.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.640]   Right.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   Exactly.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640]   Exactly.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640]   Exactly.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.640]   And the point that we tried-- Go ahead.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.640]   I'm sorry, Storm.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   I interrupted you, Rant.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.640]   That's where you're on the same branch.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.640]   So Rant away, my friend.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:14:05.640]   Well, no, I was going to say the point we were trying to make it, because, you know, it would have been an OK song, but it would have been a very trite song if it just said "Stop screwing" because you're, you know, listing my childhood, whatever it is, people always sound internet, comment sections.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:15.640]   The greater point I thought was that, as it says in the song, it's only just a snapshot of the time in which it was made.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   And, you know, as you say, it's one thing to try and change it after the fact, but you shouldn't do that and then really ignore the existence of the original version, because if that original version obviously meant something to a great many people,
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:39.640]   and you should honor that fact and keep that version feelable.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:47.640]   As we say, there's lots of lyrics and a lot of songs that we've written that listening to after the fact, you wish you could change.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   I'm betting Jonathan probably feels the same way, but it's not like we go back to the Masters and then, you know, to lyric or re-record a line and eliminate all evidence of the original recording of it.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   It was there and it was what we, at the time, and you have to just, I think, step that fact and move on.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   You have to admit that Star Wars literally does not make sense without the scene.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.640]   We're Han Solo.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   Steps on "Jabba the Huts" tale. It's a funny thing.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.640]   Oh, my God.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.640]   It's so funny.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.640]   And it doesn't even make sense without that. It's like, "Why is Jabba the Huts so angry?"
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.640]   Obviously, because Han Solo stepped on his tail.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.640]   Right.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   It's just a funny thing.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.640]   What did you say?
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.640]   So you're saying Lucas took that out? Like, that was a mistake?
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.640]   No, that's in the...
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.640]   It's put in.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640]   It's put in.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   Because you're originally shot the scene with a guy.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.640]   So when he put it in later, it was a deleted scene. When he put it in, he put a digitally created job of the hut.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.640]   But Han walks behind the guy.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   Right.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.640]   And he wouldn't be able to do that.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.640]   Forgive me for not being up on the canon on France.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.640]   I don't know these things.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   I'm just saying, when I was seven years old and I saw Star Wars, I was like, "Eh, that was okay."
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.640]   But why wasn't there anybody stepping on Jabba the Huts?
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.640]   Why is Jabba so mad at Han Solo?
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.640]   Yeah, there's no backstory. So now we know.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   Thanks to George.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:14.640]   Why is it that Han Solo is magically levitating up suddenly as he walks over Jabba the Huts.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.640]   Maybe he just can't.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   Maybe it would be too bad.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   You can't release a movie and then go back and reach into people's heads and say, "No, no, no, no. That didn't count."
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.640]   You know, that wasn't it. Just rip that out of your memories somehow.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.640]   Is this true?
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   Please.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   Well, next he'll be colorizing it and stuff like that.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   I don't think he's actually-
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   Oh, he's a heck of a hat!
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.640]   It was in color?
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.640]   He'll be black and white-typing.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.640]   He'll be warring it.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:40.640]   They're gonna be war.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.640]   Star Wars.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.640]   Well, Star Wars.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.640]   We've run out of Jaeger and Carmel, so I think it's time to wrap this puppy up.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:52.640]   Joko CruiseCrazy.com, if you want to go on the cruise, it's not too late.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   February 19th, the boat leaves and you should be on it.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.640]   Otherwise, you'll be getting awfully wet.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.640]   [laughter]
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:07.640]   Paul and Storm will be bringing Wootstock to San Francisco January 29th
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   at the place where the Marines hang out.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   That should be a lot of fun.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   I'm going to start a sketch fest.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.640]   And I know that John Hodgman will be there for sketch fest too.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   I don't know how to help him plug that because he's unaccountably left us, but I do have his book somewhere.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.640]   It's gone.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.640]   By the way.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.640]   We sold it.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.640]   It was such a deal I sold it.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.640]   No, here it is.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   Oh, there it is.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.640]   It's under the Carmels.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   That is all artificial heart.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:40.640]   Also at Jonathan's site, Joko- you sell it on the site, right, Joko.com?
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   I do.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640]   Jonathan Colton.com.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.640]   Jonathan Colton.com.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.640]   And you can still get the special package deal that Tom got.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.640]   No, that was a limited time offer.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.640]   Although if you have ordered it, you have not received it yet.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.640]   So technically, yes, you will still get it.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.640]   I wasn't going to mention that part.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   They still making the details.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.640]   I appreciate that, Tom.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.640]   It's been incredibly, it's been a much more complicated.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   Oh, wait, all it's done.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   In that case, what?
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   I think we're selling a similar package.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.640]   It's really just put some crap in there.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   Never mind.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.640]   Skype has once again ruined a good joke, but that's just what we're used to around here.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.640]   It's George Lucas.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.640]   He's blocking the face.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.640]   It's George Lucas.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.640]   I love the train going by you every three seconds.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   It's wonderful.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.640]   The fire has changed many times.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   Tom Merritt, what are you doing for the holidays?
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   What are your plans?
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   You can stay here at home or you're going to go back to Illinois?
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   No, I'm staying at home.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   I'll probably sit around and not read tech news every morning for a lovely respite.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   Maybe put on pants.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.640]   That will be nice.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.640]   Maybe.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.640]   Maybe.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.640]   Maybe.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   How about you, Mr. Jonathan Colton?
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.640]   What are your Christmas plans?
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:00.640]   I'm going to begin my odyssey to various Northeast states.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.640]   Cuz it ain't worth it.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   Parents and in-laws.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   Oh, just traveling.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.640]   All right.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.640]   It's just family.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640]   It's not working.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.640]   It's not performing.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.640]   Oh, good.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.640]   Okay.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.640]   Well, I wish you a very happy holiday with you and your family.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.640]   Mr. It looks like we've lost.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.640]   I don't know what's going on with Paul, but Paul can you hear us?
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   Paul, are you there?
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.640]   Yes.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   It's me.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.640]   Last we can hear you.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.640]   Paul, what is your last Christmas wish before we lose you forever?
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.640]   He's falling down a mile.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   Very Christmas.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   I'm going to spend my Christmas holiday batching this cable month with a hammer.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   Okay.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.640]   Well, Paul's coming to us from the 1930s apparently.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.640]   And storms gone completely.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.640]   So there you go.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.640]   Oh, no, there he is.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.640]   Oh, he's good.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.640]   All right.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.640]   Okay.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.640]   Right here.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.640]   What are you planning for the holidays, Mr. Storm?
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   Going up to the in-laws and Cape Cod going to have a fine time?
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.640]   Going to Christmas it down big time.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   Sounds great.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   We'll have a wonderful holiday, all of you, all of you at home watching.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   I wish you the best.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   We thank you for joining us for our yearly Twitch special, our holiday special with such great people like John and John and Paul and Storm and of course Tom Merritt.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.640]   Have a great holiday.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   We will see you in the new year with lots more of a tweet from all of us at the Twitch brick.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:35.640]   House our brand new home and our cozy cozy fire and a Jaegermeister infested house.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.640]   We wish you a happiest of holidays.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.640]   Did you notice the Festivus pole, by the way?
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.640]   It was such a gaudy set.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   The Festivus pole just really didn't stand out at all.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.640]   You could hardly do it.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.640]   It doesn't add a lot.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:49.640]   It does.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.640]   It does not add a lot.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640]   But we aired our grievances.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   That's what's important.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.640]   We did.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   That's what matters.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.640]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.640]   And we'll see you next time.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:20:59.640]   Bye, guys.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   [music]
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.900]   (melting)
