[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   No, no, we just moved.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   Oh, you have a new house.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Yeah, we just moved up over the hill in Morris County, New Jersey.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   Oh, nice.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   I had to move to a county after my own last name.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   You get tax breaks.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   So that's like the Lucas Ranches on Lucas Valley Road.

[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   And you're in Morris County.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.400]   Morris County, New Jersey, just outside of Manhattan.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   Nice.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   I love Morris County actually.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   It's why they need to hit the garden state.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   There's so much the whole like musical Hamilton is like everything's legal in Jersey.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   That's right.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   That's right.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   Are you near where Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton had their famous duel?
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   Oh, of course.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   Of course.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   So you know I was a history major in college.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   So I'm fascinated by this.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   So the heights of wehocking right outside of Manhattan is where the famous duel happened.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   You write by the Lincoln Tunnel.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   You know, you go through.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   Oh.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   And right down the street down here is Washington's headquarters with the winter headquarters where
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   he and Alexander Hamilton were hanging out where the Skylar sisters came down and Hamilton was
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   like cavorting around the camp, you know, with many, many ladies on a regular basis.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   During the winter quartering in Morristown.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   So the lot of history over here.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   I love it.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   Washington named her Tomcat after him.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   Wow.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   It's true.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   Hey.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   That's Owen J.J. Stone.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   Oh, Doctor is with us in the house today.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   I would liken us more to the mystery van as opposed to the A team van.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   The one you shouldn't take candy from that van?
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't fuss me as far as I could throw me and I'm kind of big.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   So you're not tossing me that far.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   But I'm just saying, you know, you're always fun.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   We love having Owen J.J. Stone on and you're looking mighty fine today.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   You're using a 70 D. What are you using?
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   70.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   I lost like eight pounds.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   I know that helps a lot.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   You know, the camera adds 10.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   So I had to drop a.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   You're only up to net to.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   I'm trying to do.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   You know, Jack of Aska.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   So I am using my 70 D looks good and I had to put boot camp on my Mac because the software
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   that I'm running is called sparko cam to run that through my Skype.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   So that's what I'm doing right now with that 50 millimeter lens.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   If the camera adds 20 pounds, Clayton must weigh 80 pounds.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   Oh, man, I've let myself go lately.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   You know, here's a little secret and broadcasting.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   I had to pop off.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   No, I was, you know, 175 is like my fighting weight.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   I'm like at 193 right now.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   And now it begins Clayton.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   It's all downhill.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   And I, the other day on the show, I literally was like, oh, my God, my neck has gotten out
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   of control.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   I had to undo the button and then just use the tie to tie it.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   And so the buttons were open because the neck is just getting out of control.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   Oh, and I know that story pretty well.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   I'm not the chokeback.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   I know.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   I borrowed it from Johnny Oz.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   It's the opening of the new Mac store.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   That's where I am right now.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   Just say it's the thinnest, lightest I've ever made.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   See.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   Yeah, it's perfect.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   It's perfect.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   No, we've moved.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   We're still waiting for our Vive, which we'll talk about later because that's traumatic.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   Wait a minute, you moved so that you could put the, that's right.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   You told us you were going to do that.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   Your husband.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   He did.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   He did that.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   He didn't ask me.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   He stole your studio.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   Yes.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   He stole your studio.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   Yes.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   He stole your studio.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   For the Vive?
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   For the Vive.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   That's awesome.

[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:15.400]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:29.400]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:43.400]   I'm going to do a couple of things.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   By the way, that means a lot of time waiting for the mail carrier.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   Just cool stuff comes in the mail.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   When you're young, it's not bills.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   It's cool stuff.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   However, as you get older, maybe form different opinions.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   One of the last things you want to do is go to the post office and wait in line to buy stamps.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   Stamps.com doesn't just eliminate that.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   Eliminates everything you would do at the post office.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   Stamps.com lets you buy and print real US postage from your desk.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   No postage meter.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   Just a Stamps.com account.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   They'll send you some great stuff that makes it even better because you can print right on the envelope.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   Your company corporate logo, it'll take your return address.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   The sender's address from your address book for sending out bills and brochures.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   If you're a seller on eBay or Amazon or Etsy and you're not using Stamps.com, you're really missing the boat.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   Stamps.com makes your package look more professional.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   You could print labels for any kind of mail or even make suggestions like,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   "Hey, you should probably send this media mail and save yourself some money."
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   I want you to go to Stamps.com right now.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   Click on the microphone in the upper right hand corner and use our offer code TWIT.

[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   You never have to guess at the postage. It knows exactly how much, so you never do too little or too much.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   You get a $5 supply kit. You get $55 in postage coupons.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   You can use over the first few months of your Stamps.com account.

[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   It's as simple as it can be. In fact, I think she's going to open the trial offer box so you can see what comes in there.

[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   Stamps.com.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   Google I/O was this week, and I have a demonstrator of one of the things Google announced, the new Google Home, which is actually a Glade air freshener.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   But it's roughly this size, right? It kind of looks like that.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   Right?
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   Is it vanilla and cinnamon?
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   Yeah, how did you know? You have the same one?
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   I grew up with that same sentiment.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   [laughter]
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   Oh, God, it's disgusting. Anyway, it is.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   [laughter]
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   I think my mom put it in a cover up nasty socks smell, you know?
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   There's a... Yeah, right.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   That's the hint that you're now a teenager, and they put the Glade all over your room.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   Spray you down with Febreze before every day.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   They announced a number of things, but I think the overarching announcement is interesting.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   So I want to know what your take is on this.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   We'll start with you, Clayton, because there's some people who said, "Oh, yeah, it's all me too stuff."
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:52.400]   Like Amazon has an Echo, so now we have the Google Home, or Facebook's got Messenger and Bots, so now we have Alol.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   Apple has FaceTime, so now we have Duo.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   You know, the VR visor looks almost exactly like the Samsung Gear VR and works pretty much the same way.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   In one respect, you could look at that and say, "These are all Me Too products," and Google's late to the party.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   The other interpretation is that Google has a secret sauce. Marco Arment wrote this actually on his website, Marco.org.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.400]   Google has this secret sauce that's going to make every one of those devices and programs
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   a leap ahead because they have been doing something none of the other companies have been doing,
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   building their machine learning and artificial intelligence over 10 years gathering information about us, about how we use it.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   And so all of these products will be superior to the existing products just because of that alone.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.400]   Well, this sort of idea that because the Echo came out last year,
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   that Google wasn't already working on something similar to this is ridiculous.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.400]   I was impressed with the overall keynote.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   In years past, if you think back to past Google keynotes, it was a mess, like a hodgepodge of things, things that didn't make sense,
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   things that really seemed out of touch with its users, with consumers.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   I thought it was pretty focused, and I thought it reflected the organization, this new alphabet organization, under Pachai's leadership,
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   it's really focused on things that Google's good at.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   I mean, Google now, and we were just testing before the show, like even just testing sports scores, things.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   Their speed with which it can return results, the contextual learning, I think has been far superior than anything out there.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   Although, obviously, seeing what Amazon's been able to do with the Echo,
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   Google had what the smart hub...
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   The Q or...
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   Remember that?
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   What was the router?
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.400]   Oh, the on hub, router.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   The on hub.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   So, they've been dancing around this idea of trying to bring everything under one umbrella for a long time.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   I think we're seeing a better implementation of that.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   Overall, I was impressed with the keynote. What about you guys?
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   Anybody feel like, "Well, Georgia, what do you think?"
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   I think that they did a great job with the keynote.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   I thought that it was clean. I think that it was interesting.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   Yeah, they're way ahead.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   She's frozen.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   You're frozen.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   See, that's why you shouldn't move your studio.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   It's going to be that...
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   Sorry.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.400]   Say that thought again, because you froze in the middle there.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   It's about AlphaGo, how they're beating people up, getting them out.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   The Go playing machine, yeah.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   Yeah, which is phenomenal. So, I think that they're really pushing the envelope with AI.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   You know, AlphaGo is interesting, though, because remember the week before AlphaGo, Facebook said, "Oh, yeah, we've got a Google.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   We've got a Go playing machine. It's going to..."
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   And then we heard anything about it since then, because then AlphaGo beats the world champion.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   And it's like, "Oh, never mind."
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   Yeah, never mind.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   We'll look at Bernie.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   Marco Arment wrote on Marco.org, because Marco is well known.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   He started at Tumblr. He's written great apps, including InstaPaper and his latest podcast,
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   AskApp, which is overcast.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   He said that this is actually a risky moment for Apple, that Apple might be faced with blackberries,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   but the "Blackberry" was the king of the world until the iPhone came out.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   But because Blackberry hadn't been doing the spade work all along over the years to make the leap into smartphones,
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   they just got eclipsed completely by the iPhone.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   And he said, "This is the risk right now that Apple, as well as Amazon and Facebook, are facing because of Google kind of investing heavily in big data web services and AI for many years."
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   Here's the question I have, though.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   How many people are using AI?
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   How many people are actually using...
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   Almost every person I'm out to dinner with or drinks, they're always shocked and kind of surprised that I can press a button and get a sports score.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   I know.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   Does anyone you know who's a late person use it?
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   No.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   Even I don't talk to my phone as much as I always think, "Oh, I should probably have just asked it.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   Oh, and what were you about to say?"
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.400]   First of all, Google is the worst thing in the world. You're all the wrong.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   Okay, that's what I thought.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   No, I'm totally joking because I just got to be the opposite person.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   In general, it's amazing to me how people get in that mindset and say, "Oh, Google's Johnny come lately."
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   And I'm like, "Well, Apple has done this for years.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.400]   They sit back and let every other phone have all these features for two or three generations."
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   Then they come in and it's Cine and Lita, and I'm in Guernet, it actually works when they do it.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   But they come in three years later after they look and see what they've done, learn from the mistakes and they made a better product.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   So why doesn't Google get that credit?
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   For doing the same thing.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   And that's what I feel this is.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   Duo looks freaking awesome.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   I was sitting with a buddy who does FaceTime, that's all he does, call it FaceTime, and people never pick up his calls.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.400]   Probably because he's annoying, but also because they can't see the stupid faces that he's making.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   I'm sure that if he had that, he could make some stupid face that people would be more likely to pick up his calls.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:54.400]   So, Duo is essentially the same as Skype or FaceTime with this one exception, KnockKnock.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.400]   Yeah, I think that's neat.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   I thought it was personable.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   You could feel something, it invokes a feeling that makes you want to answer the call or not answer the call,
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   but it's better than the blank screen that just says FaceTime Audio or FaceTime Video.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   And my second point is, as far as automation, what he was saying, kids use it more than adults use it.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   My daughter and her friends, they, well, number one, I yell at them all the time, so I'm asking me dumb questions.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   So I hear them all the time.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   Siri was this.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   Okay, Google, what's that?
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   Like, they're always asking us as parents.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   I hear kids doing it a lot.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   Oh, my kids love the echo.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.400]   They walk into the room and they can actually interact with it.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   My five-year-old, my three-year-old, she can say once she's just turned four, but she can ask the echo to play Christmas music or whatever they want.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.400]   They'll play REM or whatever.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   And they're just shocked and they start dancing around.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   They have a dance party and I don't have to be involved.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   Okay, but it's great in that it's going to make it's going to be so much harder to hang up and not answer the call when you see your friend being making cute, sad, pouty faces that you, why aren't you picking up the phone?
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   So I think that for that, that's the exact reason to FaceTime.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.400]   I don't know what I'm in for.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   And so I think that they answered a question that we have perfectly.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   And I think Owen said it really well is it makes it much more your experiential and we don't have to worry.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   What am I going to be in for?
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   And it's much harder to say no to someone directly to their face and not answer it when they're like looking going like, "Hi, please answer. I really need you. Come on."
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   Is there going to be a stalker problem though?
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.400]   I mean, your miserable ex-boyfriend keeps calling you and sends you pics.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   Let me get the train back on track.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.400]   Sorry.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.400]   First of all, we have a block button.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   Second of all, let's think about the phone calls where I'm sitting there with my flat tire and I'm showing you my flat tire and I'm asking you to call you.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   Please help me.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   You're right.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   You're flat tire fool.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   You better call AAA.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   But there's a block button for people that are stalking that are crazy.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:55.400]   And just like trying to get people not to go into bathrooms, you can't stop perves from doing what perves do, but you could try.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   Well, I just, I think it's a whole new avenue for perves.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   This is not planning anything.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   I'm just saying that's something to be aware of.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.400]   It used to be Polaroid pictures and now it's this.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.400]   I guess it's something we all have to deal with in our perves.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.400]   Interesting.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   Interesting.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   See, I was anticipating really a lot of pushback over all of the things Google's doing.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   I'm all in on Google.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   I fully embrace our future overlords, but I can understand people saying, well, now you're putting an array mic in every room of my house that the NSA could turn on at will and it has, you know, can hear a pin drop in my house.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   You're putting, you're putting, well, for instance, one of the complaints about Aloe came from Edward Snow now.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   And Edward Snow now has strong encryption built in.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.400]   It has the signal, strong encryption from the open whisper system systems that the WhatsApp has as well.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   I mean, it's good, strong encryption, but it's not on by default.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   You have to say, I want to go into incognito mode.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   And Snowden said, no, it should be on by default, but I feel like if you want to choose that, there are plenty of choices like signal and WhatsApp and even incognito mode.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   You're not going to get the AI in Aloe, which is their messaging app to know about you and listen to you unless you don't do that for a while.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:20.400]   So I'm willing to trade that privacy, especially since I don't really care if people, you know, bad customers listen in.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.400]   Oh, you have to do is ask the pertinent question.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:29.400]   Well, for us, the question, I use incognito mode in my household instead of incognito, but that's just me.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   Hashtag t-shirt pen.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.400]   I think for GWB, that would be very useful, don't you think?
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.400]   The two things you ask yourself are, one, who do you trust?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.400]   Do you trust Amazon?
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   Do you trust Google?
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   Do you trust Facebook?
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   I mean, I've got so many apps on my phone.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   Good Lord.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   I mean, you'd be mining for a year to find half of the applications we're talking about.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.400]   So after you figure out who you trust, the next question is, when's the last time you committed crime?
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   Because I, myself, is a former criminal and sometimes future criminal.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   I know better than to use objects that might talk to the NSA to FBI or the police.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   Like I said, you trust, I actually my driver's license right now.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   It doesn't have my home address on it.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.400]   You cannot find me.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   I'm in the back cave.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   So criminals know better.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   I'm not saying I am one.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   I'm just saying I might be one again in a future.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.400]   Anybody so motivated can do it, right?
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.400]   You would know better.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   So is there nobody who's going to stand up for our privacy rights and say Edward Stone is right?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   He is right.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   I think that the point of that, and I understand the thoughts of like if you're not doing anything
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   wrong, then you shouldn't have to worry about it.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   But it's not just about that.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   One is we should never have to give up our privacy in order to have a really cool feature.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   So, and the second thing is that it can be used against you.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.400]   So everyone probably has something on them that they wouldn't want other people to know.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   What kind of nefarious websites they serve, what type of people they talk to, what are their basic interests.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   And that can be used against you in order to gain control.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   And so I think that there's something really dangerous about giving up your privacy so effortlessly
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   and unfortunately by nature, people are made to want to have things easier more than they'll think ahead.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   So we'll save off, we'll sell our future for right now.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.400]   And that's the way that we are.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   And so because of that, because there's so many cool features on Aloe, you'll be like,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   "Oh, you know what?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.400]   I don't want to turn on incognito mode.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   Then I can't do any of the cool things that I want."
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   And now it's not just finding out about what you do, but also your mannerisms, the way that your patterns of speech
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   are the things that you enjoy, the things that you don't enjoy, your political alliances, where have you traveled to.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   It's getting really intrusive and I think that that's dangerous.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   It's an interesting, actually, insight, a little bit inside baseball, but there's an interesting story about the engineer
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   who worked on the encryption in Aloe.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   He has a personal blog and, of course, is with all engineers at Google, he's allowed some leeway,
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:30:00.400]   as long as it says in his personal blog, "My opinions, I'm trying to find it here," are not those of Google.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:07.400]   But he said that he really wanted to push for default end-to-end encryption.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:19.400]   And so his name is Ty Duong. He was actually a hacker, or at least a white hat hacker who came up with a number of serious flaws
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:27.400]   in a variety of technologies. He published on his blog the burning question now is if incognito mode within an encryption
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.400]   and disappearing message is so useful, why isn't it the default?
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:38.400]   In other words, lobbying for that. Those paragraphs about that have been erased from his post
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   and his title has been changed from Ty Duong is working on encryption at Google for Aloe to was working on encryption for Google
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   at Aloe. But what's interesting is that Google's sensitive to this.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   I think you're not going to get, I don't know, so here's my thought and this kind of goes back to what Marco Arment
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   was saying. Apple chose a long time ago and has doubled down on it since to go the privacy route.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:12.400]   We're going to sell the fact that we are not collecting data on you. We don't want to know anything about you
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   as one of the features of our operating systems and our devices. Google's always gone the opposite direction
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.400]   saying no, but the more we know about you, the better we can help you with things like the Google Now cards.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   And is Apple going to paint itself into a corner? Will Siri ultimately be very limited because of Apple's stance on privacy
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   and can Google go full speed ahead? And then the question is, is the market going to weigh in on in favor of privacy
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.400]   and go with Apple or in favor of convenience and go with Google? And I think those are unanswered questions at this.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   Well, what are the limitations? I mean, what are the... If you dive into some of the limitations, I mean, first of all,
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:32:01.400]   I think Siri's just behind, just because it's behind, not because it doesn't have access to all of this data in a way that Google does.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   Even if it does, Apple doesn't want to cross that creepy line, right?
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   Right, of course. Yeah, they're all in on not crossing that creepy line.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   So can they create a robust enough platform that people are actually using, even beyond our kids,
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:22.400]   in ways that are useful, like the assistant feature and be able to sort of preemptively see things that are coming up?
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   And we, you know, I think we're going to see more shades of this at WWDC this summer about how intuitive, right,
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.400]   Apple would proactive and seeing things ahead of time and making them useful.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   But are there... I'm curious what the limitations are right now.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:42.400]   I don't... I mean, other than the speed with which we're able to receive results, but that's... Google has been out in front on that.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   Well, just think about maps, for instance. Google, because they own ways, is collecting huge amounts of data about your commute.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:57.400]   And of course, the creepy line, I don't find it creepy, but some might find it creepy, is that Google now cards will tell you,
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   "Oh, it's going to take you seven minutes to get home, and maybe you want to leave now."
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:08.400]   Or, "Well, tell you, you're going to be at the airport. I see you're flying out of town tonight.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   You might want to leave now for the airport."
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.400]   I think that's insanely useful, but I think I could see reasonably some people might think that's creepy,
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   and I don't think it's something Apple can do very well because they... Well, for two reasons.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   One, they aren't collecting that information. And two, they don't want to be perceived as collecting that information.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   They don't want to cross the creepy line.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.400]   Is that going to be a market problem for them?
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   No, they're looking at your calendar. We already get nice alerts that, you know, if you leave now, you should get there because of traffic.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   Should they do more of that or less of that?
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   I think that in the end, everyone wants to have a virtual assistant that's really going to be able to help them.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   People can't afford to have an assistant to be able to deal with that, and in the end, our level of stress will be lowered if something can help us out.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:00.400]   Say, "Listen, you know what? You have two appointments at the same time. You're going to have to leave this time to be able to arrive there."
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:06.400]   And so I think that unfortunately, most people would sell off their privacy to be able to have their day-to-day life be more calm.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   In most cases, it's not going to matter. Most cases, that will not be used against me.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:17.400]   I think that the danger is that we're so effortlessly giving that away that it should be something that we're discussing more often.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   I think that most people are like, "You know what? I'm not doing anything wrong, so I shouldn't have to worry about that."
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:30.400]   But then, you know, as political, the political atmosphere changes, you don't know how that's going to be used to gain self or someone else.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   Most people live in a default world. They don't even know what the privacy settings are until there's some big help about it.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   So they live in a world where, "Oh, my privacy's on the right, so it doesn't matter."
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   Case in point, Apple just doesn't have anything to sell.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   So them collecting data on you isn't as effective as, "I bought a tile from Best Buy and they asked me, "Did I want my receipt emailed to me?"
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:57.400]   And they emailed me my receipt. And now for the next three weeks, everything I open on a webpage is going to say, "Til, buy a tile."
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   And I'm like, "Idiot, I already bought one. That's why I have the receipt."
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   And that's the power that Google has to push things into your face to sell you.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   Do you hate that because it's trying to sell you something you already bought?
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   If it were a better recommendation engine, would you embrace it?
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.400]   If it said, "Now that you've got the tile, you want the grout," that would be an ad that would be more useful to you.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.400]   Would that make it okay?
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.400]   And at some point, we will get to that and that's the whole beauty of AI and things learning how to do things and put things in position for you.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   But I can't get annoyed at it because I'm using a free service and the services service I don't pay for and they've got to make money.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.400]   And if they think they're making money on me but I already got the cookies to them, they're going to figure out in a week or two that I didn't click it.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   But Apple just doesn't have that mechanism to say, "Ooh, I've been listening to you all week.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   Let me sell you some cookies doing affiliate programs that I've got set up."
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   They have no way to benefit from it, so that's why they're so gun-ho on.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.400]   We're going to sell you products that don't sell you to the world.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   You're not for sale.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   And you're not for sale.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   But that's my point.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.400]   It's not to pay a premium.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.400]   It doesn't have to be purely for advertising.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   A lot of the benefit that Google's going to get from collecting all that information is in being a smart assistant that actually is smart as opposed to Siri, which isn't particularly smart.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   I mean...
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   Which we discussed the most people don't use anywhere outside of our bubble.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.400]   Well, maybe they would if it really were useful.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   I mean, Alo, I thought there would be more pushback to be honest with you guys.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   I'm going to have to start getting any Google here on you because you all seem to kind of welcome.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   Well, I think we're desensitized to it.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   I think once we had the baby monitors that we're hacked into and people whispering to babies, I mean, you know, there's a level of convenience for a mom and a dad to sit downstairs and watch Game of Thrones and look in on their smartphone and kind of check in on their kids, you know, with the baby monitor.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   And we're seeing this slow evolution of the home automation. I think it's way behind where I want it to be.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   I want the home to be more integrated.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   Isn't that why we love the Echo?
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   Because it disappears as a device.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   It's really you're talking to your house.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   Right.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   To have that unified experience, like HomeKit, that hasn't really come to fruition in the way that we would want.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   Even talking to companies that want to have HomeKit integration feel like Apple has not, has been letting that language and or making it difficult for them to get the proper implementation into it, some, some companies.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   You know, even like this, even companies that, and I know Leo, you had played with this and I've been playing with it.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   In fact, they want to send you a new one because I was talking about you with them.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   The E Rio?
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   Yeah, they keep trying to send me.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   They're fans and I haven't been able to get it to work.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   Well, you had like some firmware issue with like a journalist and used one, but I'm talking to like what their future looks like.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   They're really looking at the home as this sort of connected environment.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   Well, they're absolutely trying to solve a major problem, which is that we all embraced wireless networking and it was a great thing until everybody else did.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.400]   Now it's so congested that it doesn't work very well.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   Well, until we get a situation where I hear about somebody getting busted from their home, from their nest.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   Until that, that has to happen one time for you to get pushback for me and the nation.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   But as of right now, if the NSA is out there listening to me and they know what my secret highest spot is for that stuff that I keep secret at my house, they haven't come out to get it yet, then I'm cool.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.400]   Because if David was listening, then they would know.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400]   Well, I think I understand what you're saying.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   And it's kind of what I've been saying, which is most of the dangers, the hazards of this stuff are hypothetical.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   For now, I mean, I'll ask people and they'll say, "Well, what if your insurance company denied you insurance because Google told me we're eating a lot of donuts?"
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.400]   Yeah, that would be bad, but that's a hypothetical risk that hasn't happened.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:55.400]   And in fact, if you think about it, one of the reasons life insurance companies ask you so much information before they give you life insurance is so that if you lie about anything, they could do it.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   And they could deny you your payout.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   Oh, he said he didn't smoke, but you know what?
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   We got video of him smoking.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.400]   They know plenty about you already.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   I don't think that's a hazard, but you make a point.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   And yet, if that does happen to one, isn't it going to be too late by the time that happens?
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:20.400]   You know, what if we get an authoritarian government that decides to start using this against us?
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.400]   By then, it's too late.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   We all have microphones in our house.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.400]   By that point, they got armies and tanks and guns and stuff that we got to worry about far more than a listen to the way.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   But this is a tool they can use with those armies and tanks and guns.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   We can go red dawn on their ass.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.400]   I know.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   I want that to happen.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   To your point, I want to go in the hills and be afraid of fighting.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   We're going to open man cave and fight, and then you can live.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   Like, I unplug my PlayStation and ask reason I have an Xbox, and the Xbox always listen.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.400]   That's why I don't have an Xbox.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.400]   Okay, so you want to wear this?
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.400]   I don't plug everything that listens to me.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:40:00.400]   Well, the worst thing about this, and I presume the Google Home as well, I'm holding up an Amazon Echo.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   By the way, if anybody wants to buy my Echo, I'm going to put it on Craigslist because I got about five of these, and I'm going to buy Google Homes now.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   I would say to send me one, but I'm scared to have it in my house.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   Well, because this has a very fairly sophisticated array mics in here, it's just not like the microphone on your smartphone.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.400]   This is a microphone that can hear everything in your house.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:37.400]   And what we don't know, and could very well be happening, we just don't know, is national security letters could be going out to Amazon, saying, oh, by the way, we'd like to turn on the Echo at 140 Keller Street, and listen for a while.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.400]   That's the most frightening of all of this.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.400]   And that could be happening right now, we just don't know.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:49.400]   Because we're opting into these technologies, right? We're buying and choosing to put an Echo in our home or not, or turn it off in the case of Owen.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   We have all these other devices that we choose to plug in, and we're opting in on these different websites, and obviously Google now features when we, or as you mentioned, a lot of it's default, so we're not necessarily opting into a lot of it, some of it's on by default.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   But with a government, that's an entirely different animal, and absolutely does not have a right to be spying on Americans.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   What point do you give up your civil liberties?
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   So the way to pursue this is go after the NSLs, and the FISA courts, and all of that, as opposed to say, well, I'm not going to have anything in my house, because I just worry about it.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   Yeah, we need to have the government supposed to protect our rights, and the funniest part is that they don't need to bug us anymore, we're bugging ourselves, we're like bringing all this stuff in, so it makes it really easy for them.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   And there's no way that a government entity that would be able to do good wouldn't say, you know what, let's just turn on this little, tiny advice, it's already there, and it'll hear everything, and let's be able to track whatever's happening for whatever reason.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   And if a government is doing the right thing, then you wouldn't really have to worry about that.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   But unfortunately, you never know.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   You never know with people and power.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:42:12.400]   You just want more of that, and if you end up with a government entity that might be more nefarious than you want, they may be using this for ill will, and be able to control other political opponents so that they're not going to go out there, because they know websites you've been surfing on late at night, and be able to leak that out, which would ruin your campaign and be able to tie up people's hands.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:29.400]   The FBI, we know this for a fact, the FBI planted bugs all around the federal courthouse in San Mateo County, because they were wanting to hear privileged conversations between attorneys and felons, or felons on trial.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:40.400]   So, and they did this, and so now admittedly you're in the public, it's a little different than in your house, a lot different than in your house.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:47.400]   Nevertheless, I think this shows there's a strong inclination on the part of law enforcement to gather information any way they can.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.400]   First of all, let me just say.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   Look at England with all the cameras everywhere.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   What about the one politician that tweeted out his website and then had porn tabs open, he told him it's up.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   And Georgia, you're immune to this because he was doing research on, I want to be very clear about that.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   Let me finish my statement.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   So, you know, this guy's telling us Americans are dumb.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   We live in a world where we're a heartbeat away from maybe elected down Trump is president.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   We think that the government can get themselves together to listen in on the do so than on somebody's phone.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   Hold on while I sit by tea about that.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.400]   Now, should Donald Trump become elected?
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   I think he would have the competence.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   And maybe even the desire and will to in fact start doing stuff like this.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   I don't think we're so far away from.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.400]   I don't think we've never been into your history.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:46.400]   Buff Clayton, we've never been far away from that risk that that's something we have to be eternally vigilant of a government that is not.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.400]   That's what the founding fathers were worried about.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.400]   Stinging for crying out loud wrote when he was with the police in the early 80s.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   Every breath you take is about Reagan's America.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   That was stings.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.400]   That was exactly this idea of surveillance and constantly watching.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.400]   And so we've been this has been around for many, many years.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   This isn't new under Trump.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.400]   This isn't new under Obama.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   Oh, I agree.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   I believe getting body cams all of these things.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   You know, is it making us safer?
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.400]   How intrusive is it?
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   We're in public spaces.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   Can people be listening in with microphones and all of these things?
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   Police departments, of course, want this technology, right?
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   You see it around the NYPD, you see it around New York City streets with police cameras and things all over the city.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.400]   But in the end, it ends up being very often just citizen awareness that stops things.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   Remember that van that was parked in Times Square near New Year's Eve or during the Christmas holiday season?
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.400]   It was packed with explosives or whatever.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.400]   It was because like a little bodega owner noticed it and called the police.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.400]   Even all of the cameras that were right there.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:51.400]   And one of those little sub towers where the police, they can go up into the ladder and hang out, didn't even notice it.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   There's a widespread use now stingrays.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:45:05.400]   Local police all over the country are using these devices that simulate a cell tower and collect not just the cell phone information of a bad guy, but everybody in the area.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   Everybody goes by the stingray, joins the cell tower.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   They can collect text messages.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.400]   They can collect information from your phone.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   They certainly know who you are.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.400]   This is spreading a net.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   So in other words, law enforcement is certainly willing, and I would say 99.9% of them are probably well intentioned, but certainly willing to use technology to surveil us with the intent of making us safer.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.400]   And I respect that intent.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:42.400]   Okay, so the reason I brought all this up is I tried to raise some concern about what Google's up to, but at the same time, I think that these are devices I want in my house.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:55.400]   We should, from the history perspective, Thomas Jefferson talked about fearing the government, that the government should fear the people, that people should never fear its government, that they should be always in fear of the people.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   And that when the government becomes too big, we should throw off the shackles of this government.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:11.400]   So the idea that Owen, to your point, saying, you know, what, that they're competent enough or that they just don't have the wherewithal, yes, they're going through all of our emails, but, wow, what the heck, are they really going to sit there and pour it out.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   Or really going to sit there and pour through all of this or create the algorithms to really study and find out, you know, minority report style pre crime where things are about to happen.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   I don't know.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   I'm troubled the fact that they have computers make it easier.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   Anyway, I mean, that they have access to our phone calls or listening to anything we say.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.400]   You're right.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   You never know when someone's going to be using this information as in the case of the IRS.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   Look what the IRS scandal and the Cincinnati offices.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:42.400]   I mean, well, I don't care what your political persuasion is, you know, Democrat, conservative, libertarian, whatever.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   The fact that they were targeting conservative groups and actually limiting their ability at free speech and to be able to get money and to actually form organizations and the IRS was specifically targeting them.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   That's troubling.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   Now, on the other hand, I think, Aloe, which is their messaging program, you know, you have encryption.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   It's not on my default.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   I think that has some very interesting ideas.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   The idea that you, for instance, this is where I think Google's doing something very intriguing.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   And it's not just Aloe.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   It's also the instant app feature that they kind of ended the keynote with as a quick mention.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   I think what they're trying to do, and it will be beneficial for Google, is become an intermediate between you and your apps.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:39.400]   One of the problems I had with Facebook's Messenger bots is that you had to subscribe to individual bots, and then they annoyed you.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   You know, I subscribed, as I mentioned before, to that weather bot, and it just bugged me so much that I had to block it.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.400]   I couldn't turn it off.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.400]   I had to block it like a stalker.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   And the way Aloe's going to work is you don't add bots.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.400]   You interact with bots by interacting with Google.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   So you say, "Google, what's a restaurant near me?
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   I need an Italian restaurant near me.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.400]   What are the best ones?"
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.400]   It tells you.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.400]   This will make a reservation at that one.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.400]   It then calls on open table.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:15.400]   And if you don't have open table installed, the instant app will load just enough open table, not the whole app, just enough open table to make a reservation, and get back to you.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.400]   I think this is really interesting.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   I think this is a kind of a two things.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   It's a new form of search.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   Google, of course, the king of search, had realized, and they said this at the very beginning, Sundar Pachai said this.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   The 10 blue links are not search anymore.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.400]   That's not what people want anymore.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   It's a new kind of search that's more interactive, more talking to an agent that's working on your behalf.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:41.400]   And it's also a new way of thinking of your devices in the case of a cell.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   In apps.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   Yeah, because you don't need apps.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   You just, your cell phone now becomes your do everything device.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.400]   And it calls upon the skills it needs.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.400]   It loads the skills it needs ad hoc as needed.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   I think that's a revolution.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   I think it could be.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   I think the future was apps.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.400]   And then we have 30 apps from one company that all do different things, right?
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   Messenger, then you have Facebook pages, Facebook mentions, Facebook live, 30 apps from one company.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   And this is putting these overlays, sort of circumventing the open web, but also not having you have to open all of these different apps, but pulling out the best parts of these apps.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   And we started to see this over the past few years with Apple as well and iOS, you know, extensibility and being able to tap into certain features.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   I think it's one of the best things to happen to mobile since the beginning.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:41.400]   So you see, this is the problem all we all have as technologists is on the one hand we want these capabilities.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   We want these skills are excited by what they offer.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   And the other hand we know as well as anybody, the risks inherent in using these tools,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   how do we balance this?
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   Oh, and what do you think?
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   Of all of us, you have been probably the most affected by inappropriate government attention.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   You get, you've been pulled over how many times this year?
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   This year six last year, 13 for driving while black.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   Pretty much 90% of the time.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   Because you're a big African American driving a nice car in a nice neighborhood.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   Yeah, last year I got stopped 13 times, I think it ended up in a whole year.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   And I got two tickets.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   So either I'm just checking it out.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.400]   They're seeing what are you doing?
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.400]   The sad thing is you're often you've got your daughter in the car though.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   I said the last time you were in your own, you were in your own driveway.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   You were in front of your house.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   So like that's what I was saying earlier, like as far as I'm concerned, they're not to pull the black car,
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   but people of my nature have been used to the government doing things to them and being on top of them and secretly doing stuff for history and a lifetime.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.400]   So I know that they're doing something I'm supposed to do.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   I try not to worry about live my day to day life.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:01.400]   And I know that if it ever gets bad, when people say that riding and protesting all that kind of stuff,
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   I know that there's a fire in people's hearts that if the government went too far, we were burning this sucker down.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:11.400]   And it would look like Batman Dark Knight and we would rise up against the overlord.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.400]   I do have, you know what?
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.400]   I do have faith.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   I do have faith.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.400]   I do have faith.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:24.400]   I hope it doesn't come to a red dawn, but I do have faith that the people are smart enough to protect ourselves.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.400]   That's what we've done on the line.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.400]   You know, you're not smart enough at the end of the day.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.400]   You're smart enough to protect yourself.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.400]   You know, we might not be smart enough to like listen to Edward Snowden, you know, some people think he's a traitor,
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   some people think he's a liberator of knowledge.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   So, you know, everybody has their own opinion.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   But at the end of the day, when all people are oppressed at one time, that's why all empires have fallen.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.400]   That's right.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.400]   America's looking pretty good right now, but you tell me one other empire in history that has not come a tumbling down.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.400]   And when greedy gets too greedy, then the needy get super needy.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   But I would also point out, yeah, go get creased, but I would also point out, and I know Clayton, you know this well,
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:12.400]   that it never is bloodless. It is never victimless, that it is a very painful, violent process that one would want to avoid in any way as much as one could.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.400]   And at this point in history, this is actually one of the better situations, right?
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   Like, so they're stealing her information or messing with her taxes.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.400]   They're stealing property and phone conversations and throwing you in jail.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   But it's not like they're coming in and just not having a whole town.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   It's like more freedom than that.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   But should we still have a fight?
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   It's a mixed bag.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.400]   It's good. It's good. But shouldn't we fight for more?
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:45.400]   I think that everyone still has a right to be able to serve whatever they want to serve, and it shouldn't be preeminently, you know, dealing with what you might do.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   It should be what you have done.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   And so I think we should still be informed and be able to say to our governments, this is not something that we think is acceptable.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   So that they don't go too far, and we have everyone being able to feel that freedom of not having to be creeped out about their echo in their house, which I'm with you Owen.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.400]   It creeps me out. I don't have one for that reason.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.400]   Really?
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.400]   I don't even like it.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   Really?
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   I don't even like having Google know my location on my computer or be every time I surf the web for somewhere, and I always sign out of Google.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   And then they add another look. You've been looking at kites.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   Here's some other kites. I'm thinking, "Ah, you know what?
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   How could they know that?
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.400]   They'll bother me."
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   All my information is wrong on my accounts.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   I've since been many times like Facebook, "Thanks, I'm a 63-year-old white man.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.400]   They send me stuff for my aggro.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.400]   I got the old lady dated sites.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.400]   This is the coolest thing.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.400]   They're like, "There's a 68-year-old woman in your neighborhood."
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.400]   I'm like, "Oh, yeah!
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   Get out of there.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.400]   They're all spending me with a long-term stuff."
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.400]   By the way, you could start sending all those ads to me.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.400]   That would be great.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.400]   Thank you.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.400]   So you're whack.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:54.400]   No, and the reason I bring both of you in is because Clayton and I are, of course, we're
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.400]   going to embrace it.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.400]   We got nothing to lose.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.400]   We're the establishment.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   Clayton's at the top of Jersey.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   I'm at the bottom of Jersey.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   We live in two totally different eco-spheres of the Jersey lifestyle.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   But I think it's important that we understand the risks for everybody.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.400]   You know, it's a difficult challenge because I have an echo.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.400]   I love my echo.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.400]   I have many echoes.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.400]   I have echoes everywhere I go.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:24.360]   There's a great article I read about not using your thumbprint on your phone because what
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.400]   if you get pulled over and now they're checking to see if you texted or didn't text?
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.400]   But what if they go in there and they see, "Okay, well, you smoke weed."
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   And they find a picture, "You smoke weed."
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.400]   They're like, "Oh, you smoke weed."
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   They don't have to look far.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.400]   I posted one on my Facebook page.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.400]   Or like, again, I think of crazy things like, you know, there are perverts in the world,
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.400]   right?
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:45.400]   And I think it happens if you get mistaken as a pervert because you got pictures of a child,
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.400]   "Oh, it happens to be your nephew or your niece."
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   But this person has a heart on and wants to put a case against you.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:53.400]   And they felt like, "I just think of all the outlandish things of why not.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.400]   I can't even use my fingerprint on my phone and get it on my phone quick because I don't
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   want anybody looking through my phone."
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   So you don't use fingerprint?
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:05.400]   No, I got, I always tell myself because I signed a criminal, but I'm not.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.400]   I got, I got, I got, I got, I got taken to the police station.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.400]   I had a warrant out because I had a ticket.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   I was in the hospital.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   I missed the court.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   It was filing out a ticket.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   I wasn't doing anything criminal speeding.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   But when they took me in, I was like, "Well, I already paid the bail."
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   And they took me in anyway because the system was messed up.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   The fingerprint man, the guy's like, "Oh, unlock your phone."
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   And I'm like, "What do you need to go to my phone for?"
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   And he's like, "I just need to unlock your phone."
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   Because he didn't like what I was talking to him because I already paid it.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   Yeah, you were mouthing off.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   So he, he left the room and I unlocked my phone, my handcuffs.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.400]   And I called my friend.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.400]   I'm like, "Yo, get down here to this police station just to check on me.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.400]   Make sure I'm all right."
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   And he comes back and I saw you on the phone.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   Who are you calling?
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   And I'm like, I was calling my, my brother to come here.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   So I make sure I'm all right.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   He's like, "Well, I want to roll the tape back.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   If you saw anything incriminating, I'm going to listen to it."
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   I'm like, "Oh, free to go.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.400]   Listen to the tape."
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.400]   But he really wanted to get on my phone.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   And again, long story short, I had paid the bail because I was going to be going to court.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.400]   And that's, I missed it.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   And I had to pay work and everything.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   But in their system, it said that I, I was out on this bail.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   So I was like, "Why do you want to go on my phone?"
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   Now again, I don't have anything on my phone.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.000]   It's kind of a fishing, it feels like a fishing expedition, doesn't it?
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.520]   They're looking for, now of course you get in a court, they're going to say you can't,
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.080]   they can't use that.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   Nevertheless.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.760]   Well, even that, he, he forgot to read me my rights when he arrested me or whatever.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:28.480]   So when he comes in, he's like, he's like, "I need you to fill out this form that says,
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.480]   I read you your rights."
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   I'm like, "Well, you didn't."
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.960]   He's like, "I just need you to sign it because you read them to me later."
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.440]   I'm like, "Well, I can't sign that."
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.440]   And he's like, "Why not?"
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.440]   "Oh, you're trouble."
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   "Oh, you're trouble."
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   "I don't plan around.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.440]   When I know I'm in the right, oh, you, you, you ain't going to send her blam, mate."
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.760]   I was like, "I can't sign that."
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.760]   He's like, "Why not?"
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.360]   I'm like, "Because you didn't read my rights, but I got here."
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.360]   I can't acknowledge.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   He's like, "You have to sign it."
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.360]   I'm like, "So you're saying I have to sign it?
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.360]   You're forcing me to sign it?
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.440]   Because you can initial that and I'll say force to sign it."
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.440]   Now sign it.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.440]   And then he just walked out.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.080]   10 minutes later, I was like, "Oh, anyway."
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   "But you're lucky to get your knees."
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:05.080]   "I'm like, man, look, I tell you what, like I said, I am super duper polite, but half
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.080]   the time I get pulled over, I was bumping Taylor Swift.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   And there ain't nothing.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.080]   I mean, my radio's loud.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.080]   I got a 3,000-
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.080]   I know how it is.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.080]   Taylor Swift gets you angry.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.080]   I was bumping Taylor Swift.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:16.080]   Cop pulls me over and I'm thinking, "Man, I was bumping the widest thing of people."
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.080]   I'm like, "It's like a tail light sound."
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.920]   I'm like, "My tail light can't be out, sir.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.080]   This car is three months old.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   It's a 2015.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080]   It's brand new.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.080]   Got 3,000 miles on it."
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   Well, you're telling us that.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   Life's registration.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   I'm like, "I'm going to take a picture of my tail light."
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.240]   If you come back with a ticket from my tail light being out, I'm going to need you to allow
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.160]   me to get out of my vehicle so I can take a picture of my tail light.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.920]   He comes back, I gave you a verbal warrant for the tail light being out, fix it."
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   And I'm like, "Was your tail light out?"
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.920]   And what's that?
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   No.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.920]   No.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.400]   So really, he's checking you out.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:45.200]   Yeah, again, and I was like, I know it, again, my radio's loud, but it's like I always
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.480]   had a noise or a nizles during the middle of the day, and I was on the highway.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   But he just didn't like that.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:55.240]   I was thumping down the street, and I was like, "It's Taylor Swift, bad blood, brother.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.440]   You don't like Taylor Swift that much?"
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:00.800]   Like, you know, it was America.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   So yeah.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.160]   I'm dancing really loud to music in my car.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.720]   I never had that happen.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.280]   You're a Canada.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.360]   You see someone dancing crazy in the car.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.360]   It's me.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.800]   I turn up NWA as loud as I can, and I cannot get pulled over.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.800]   Well, the best thing about my car radio being loud is when I pull up lead at school, all
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.280]   the kids start dancing, even across the lady starts dancing.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   I love that.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:26.800]   And then I love pulling up on people that are like stodgy and annoying, and I throw in some
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.680]   classical music or something, and I roll my window down, and I give him that great pull
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.680]   palm over.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.680]   You're just trouble around.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.680]   He's trouble.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:39.680]   I can't see what you'd be pulled over.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.480]   Were you blasting classical music at those elderly people, Mr. Stone?
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:47.520]   There I choose one of 15 points.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:53.000]   My brother has the car from the Great Pupan commercial, and he actually carries it in
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   his glove compartment because people used to stop him.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.200]   He has a rolling or something.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   Yeah, Bentley.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.280]   Yeah, Rolls-Royce Bentley.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.080]   And he would, yeah, people would actually ask him, do you have any Great Pupan?
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.080]   And he would actually give you.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.840]   Yes, his men of actually do.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.440]   I have a spoonful, but don't forget to give it back.
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:13.960]   Cool, the person in Canada, your brother is.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.200]   Why is he rocking a Bentley?
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.400]   My brother has all kinds of old cars.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.320]   He's got the old Cadillac with the fins.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.480]   Oh, does he have a Lincoln with suicide doors?
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.480]   He does not have a license.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   That's what I want.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.280]   He doesn't want everybody tracking him.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.280]   He doesn't want the GPS.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.720]   He's got that old school, no tech, low tech.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.320]   No airbags for me, man.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:38.560]   He makes a game of thrones set up in his backyard with like, you know, all the walls
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.200]   of faces and he knows what.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.000]   My brother has Narnia in his backyard.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.160]   He has Castle Ruins.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:51.320]   He has an old like skulls that it's like he has like, it's amazing.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:56.040]   His backyard is used for like, yeah, people just go to hang out at my brother.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.520]   So he was just thinking about getting an air hockey table.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.240]   Yeah, is he in Canada?
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.480]   He's in Canada.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.480]   You come down Canada.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.640]   I need an invite to a family dinner.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   Let's put that on this guy's.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.200]   We're all going to go have smoked me and put team on down.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.720]   My brother's barbecue.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.720]   You guys are made.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.520]   Is this in Montreal?
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.520]   You can totally come.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.520]   It's really.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520]   Let's go.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.120]   Let's go to Montreal road trip.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.400]   Montreal's awesome.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.400]   I love Montreal.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.640]   Clayton, you too.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.640]   You can head on down.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.880]   Oh, I'd love to.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.160]   We'll come to the red wedding.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.080]   That's not pushing.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.080]   Let's not push it.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.240]   I'm a skipped old man.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.880]   I was going to copy and shot.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.840]   You're not trying to red wedding.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.160]   The girl has no nose.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.960]   Let's take a break and come back with more.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.280]   We got O and J.J. Stone.

[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.520]   Georgia Dao from imore.com, Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   It's a great team.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.360]   I told you to be fun.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   Told you we'd have some fun today.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.560]   Our show today brought you by Go to Meeting.

[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.240]   It's like being in the same room together.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.120]   But you don't have to go to lunch afterwards.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.040]   I like that.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.040]   Share your screen.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.200]   You get on the same page.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.720]   You can pass off presenter duties.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.920]   Great for collaboration.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   Great for pitches.

[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.000]   You can even if there's a big, this is kind of mean, but you have private chats and video
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.800]   links you could be doing in the background while the guy's doing his presentation.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.800]   Go to meeting.

[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.040]   I think we've probably done Google I/O.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.280]   We did the VR we talked about.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.520]   We talked about the Glade home thing.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:34.840]   We talked about the instant apps.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.520]   It was actually nice to love on Google.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.080]   Google actually did something right for all on board.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.080]   I'm a shocked.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.720]   I really thought that people would be just slamming them.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.200]   Well, wait, I do still think that Google is cybernet.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.200]   I'm not saying they're not.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.200]   Skynet.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.800]   Skynet is a company that makes, yeah, I think they're.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.840]   They all be one of Google's socks.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.000]   I'm just saying that they made some cool products.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.160]   I noticed we're downplaying the use of the term artificial intelligence and big on machine
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   learning.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.520]   That sounds harmless, right?
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.400]   It's machine learning.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400]   Or is it scary?
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.400]   They have a big man.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.400]   That's kind of worse.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.600]   That's kind of a sad dog and the spider's like, no, they're already.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.400]   The big problem Google has though, the big problem Google has right now is they have abandoned
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.480]   so many great things.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   They put out so many things like the on-humper out or there's an example that had all this
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.920]   promise that never materialized that there's going to be a lot of people are going to say,
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.480]   well, I'm going to wait and see is Alo going to be great?
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.920]   Is the Google home going to be great?
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.480]   I'm going to wait and see.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   Google Glass.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.520]   The Google Glass was not great though.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.360]   No, it wasn't.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.320]   Google also has the ability to and the thing I respect is they do let things go to bring
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.440]   in new things because when something hits, it hits and then when it takes off, it takes
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440]   off.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.240]   They usually don't beat a dead horse.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:57.200]   But the other problem Google has is they have no marketing budget whatsoever.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.600]   This duo thing was the first thing that I can think of that they've done that as I said
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.240]   earlier made me feel something.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.000]   Now, Apple even though I'm sick of it and I'm forced fed it and I understand it, they
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.200]   always make me feel like I'm going to be a better person when I buy their stuff.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.720]   I know I'm still a piece of trash.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.160]   But when I first buy this phone, I feel like I'm better than everybody else is not in this
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.160]   line.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.160]   Well, that's a great, a dead out.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   Apple does.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160]   Yeah, I got your next phone on one.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160]   That's a great question.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160]   Take a look.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160]   Take a look.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160]   This is your next phone on.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.160]   The new flip phone?
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.160]   I'm waiting there.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.600]   Oh, that thing looks awesome.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.160]   No, you're lying.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.160]   That looks terrible.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.440]   I'm trying to transform my Voltron.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.400]   You don't know what's going on.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.640]   This is project era.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:43.320]   This was something that Motorola had left behind when they left Google to join Lenovo.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.960]   And Google, one of the things they announced at Google I owe is, yeah, we're putting this
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.200]   out this fall, the developer edition will be out.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.480]   It's a modular phone.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.840]   You think this is a good idea?
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.840]   Hey, again, they try it.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.360]   I might buy it again.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.520]   The problem is they don't make me feel anything.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.800]   Google, if anybody's listening to Google, listen, hire me.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.480]   I will make a commercial for you to actually make people feel something.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.440]   Even if they hate it, I'll make them feel something.
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.360]   Y'all don't make people feel anything with all this stuff you make, which is the biggest
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.800]   problem because you can't even bring people in and trick them to buying it and then phone
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   in love with it.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.400]   Because most of the time, my iPhone isn't perfect, but I think it is because I've been
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.400]   burning out.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.400]   You love it.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.400]   You've been brainwashed.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.400]   You want to be brainwashed.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400]   I can't even go back to the windows.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.680]   I had to put boot camp on my Mac because I can't justify my brain buying a PC anymore.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.680]   It's true.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.320]   Apple is a little too good at marketing, if you ask.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.360]   But we're missing a larger point, which is the storefront.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:38.520]   Amazon, right on the front of Amazon.com, every one of their new kindles, the Echo, right
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520]   at the top.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.120]   We don't have sales numbers, of course.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.200]   But it's doing well.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200]   We know that.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   And we know that we know that.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.600]   Are you going to buy that $300 Oasis?
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.600]   I've been testing.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.600]   He's on the nose.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.600]   He's on the nose about the storefront.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.320]   But I mean, look at, you know, look what Amazon's not well.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:00.520]   So to your point, oh, I mean, Amazon's willing to concede defeat with like the Amazon phone,
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   right?
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.680]   That was Bezos Pet Project.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:08.840]   And it was a disaster cut off, gone, totally deleted, no sign of it.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.840]   Amazon.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.760]   But you know, to your point, where do you go to buy Google stuff?
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.920]   I mean, are you on the front page of Google, you know, Google.com, the coveted home page
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   where we saw the Nexus for a short time, right?
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.720]   Was it the Nexus there for a short time?
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.080]   They don't want to put ads though.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.080]   They're right.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.120]   They want that to be the clean people were bad at them putting it next to set.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120]   Google.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.120]   You can have a Google store.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.520]   Is that the next is there is a Google store?
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.440]   Oh, you mean a physical store?
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.840]   A physical Google store.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:42.080]   I mean, I think there's store.google.com is actually pretty as good as apples, isn't it?
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.080]   It sells the product.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.280]   What he's saying is I can walk into it.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.280]   I can see it.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   I can feel like I can taste it.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280]   All right.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.280]   Talk to some of you.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.280]   All right.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.680]   After we go visit Georgia's brother in Montreal, you're all invited to the new Apple
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.200]   Union Square store.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.080]   They just opened it Thursday.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.000]   This is a beautiful store.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.640]   I think this is Dopey.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.600]   Let's do the dough in the dough.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.080]   Yes, it's Dopey.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.840]   This is a Dopey store.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.840]   What's Dopey about it?
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.920]   Do we have the video that Kara shot?
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:12.040]   Is that around in the Tri-Cast or no?
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.000]   We sent somebody down to shoot some video of it.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.840]   So this is their 15th anniversary store and they're redoing all the Apple stores.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.280]   I think they're going to look like this.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:24.160]   It has a forest, a little garden grove inside the store.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.160]   What are you hateful?
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.720]   What do you have again?
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.720]   It's not a store.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.720]   It's not a store.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720]   It's not a store.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.720]   Not the genius bar, the genius grove.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.720]   You can go out and get some free basil.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.720]   I love it.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.720]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.720]   It has to be a genius.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720]   Free basil.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.400]   This is a place where people can just hang out and chill and I think that's what people
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   are missing.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.040]   People are so sick of buying things online with computers where we can actually go there
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.880]   and actually meet other people and hang out and relax and not have to feel any pressure,
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.400]   have some cool Apple products hanging out in the background.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:03.920]   You can check out the nice beautiful rose gold but relatively useless Macbook and just
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.920]   enjoy.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.840]   There'll be music, there'll be bands, there'll be artisans.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.600]   You can go there and have a meeting.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.600]   There'll be places where you can hang.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.800]   This is an area where we can actually deal with community and have Apple products in
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   the background.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.000]   I think it's brilliant marketing.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.840]   Those 42 foot glass doors opening those up so that it becomes part of, it's no longer
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   a store.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.240]   It's just an area you can walk in and forget where inside is and outside is.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.480]   I think it's great marketing.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.480]   That's my thought.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.360]   Leo, Leo, Leo, you are so wrong, Captain.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360]   Get off my lawn.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.920]   This is technology as a lifestyle.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.520]   This is exactly what's wrong with Apple.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.080]   See, you don't understand the way the world works.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.160]   We live in a world where we're jaded by everything, digital and beefy-bop and then you tell kids
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.160]   don't go outside.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:54.040]   Well, the trick to get them to go outside is to bring the outside to inside the door.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.480]   There's trees in the place.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.400]   Have you not been into pan and seen bonzo trees inside of a room in the spirit and the
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.560]   essence of life and the fun way?
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560]   You don't know about fun way.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   I'm telling you, I don't want fun way.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.480]   I want a guy starting computer.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.760]   I think they're selling a lifestyle that is bogus.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.760]   It's BS.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.120]   Listen to the love of George's voice.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.120]   You can't even believe it.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.120]   That's all the matters.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.120]   I don't believe.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.040]   All the love and George's voice.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   You can't even fight that with your grumpy old man.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   Get off my lawn.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.680]   I'm bringing you a bonzo tree next time I come out there.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.680]   I know.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.680]   I want a bonzo tree.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.600]   I got the floating one on Kickstarter.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600]   I'm fine on bonzo.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.800]   Is it, has it arrived?
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800]   Not yet.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800]   Probably whenever you think.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.000]   He's just grumpy about trees.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.160]   I want because he's a bonzo tree.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.920]   I don't want to conflate trees with commerce.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.920]   Trees are trees.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920]   They should be in a forest.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.920]   Go in the forest.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.920]   That's fine.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.920]   This is a store.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.800]   Beyond just the aesthetic, what has changed from the experience?
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.720]   I mean, that's the large part.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.320]   They're not selling stuff anymore.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.520]   They're right.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.000]   That's what's changed.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.160]   They're trying to make it an app.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   I'm not kidding.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.720]   I find this creepy.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.120]   They're trying to make an Apple lifestyle.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.360]   This is taking the brand too far in my opinion.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.760]   It's a trend in the world.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.400]   If you go to Asia, they have cat and puppy shops where you just walk in and literally
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.720]   drink coffee with somebody's cat because you want to feel things and be outside.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.880]   And this is what you want.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.880]   This is what you want for the world.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.920]   I wish for the hopping days of the old report when you used to work out of a cottage and
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.960]   has the spirituality and as is some of the fun.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.600]   Now you've got this big industrial warehouse and you think that you're on top, Mr. Well,
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.000]   you're wrong because I heard the love of trees in here and then you'll be visiting the
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.600]   Twit Forest.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600]   You better do it.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.480]   And also in your will, put your thing as an urn as a plant so you can be planted as
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.480]   a tree when you die.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.480]   I love trees.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.480]   I love nature.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.540]   I think it's that you just don't want to go to a store to hang out with other people
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:46.840]   because you're done after you're not.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.840]   It's cultish.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   You're done with people.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.080]   I'm going to put my sneakers and my white running shoes and my white tracksuit on and
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.000]   I'm going to sit there and say I'm waiting to be taken up to Steve's land.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   It's cultish.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   It's weird.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   It's creepy.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   They're selling computers.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   They're making.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.840]   They're fetishizing this stuff.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.000]   But I don't think so.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.480]   I think that they're giving something back to the community where if you have a small startup,
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.280]   you can go there and hang out and actually deal with business.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.600]   If you, it's going to have the little tiny open union square thing where you can just
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.880]   sit there 24/7, not buy anything, listen to music, have free Wi-Fi, drink your latte.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   I think that's what they want.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   They don't buy anything at all.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.280]   Yeah, it just makes it a part of the community.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.480]   It's kind of giving back.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.080]   Whereas, yeah, we could say that the echo where you're able to sit in your house and
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.240]   you no longer even have to leave the house for getting like.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   Yeah, but wait a minute.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.280]   Remember, we have a massive homeless problem in San Francisco.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.280]   I was just about to say San Francisco.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.040]   Wait a moment, wait a moment, homeless people start coming in.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.080]   Are they going to let them sit around new?
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.480]   Well, they just had a problem with that out here in Philly with Philly Jesus, went to an
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.800]   Apple store and apparently he went on there on a day when there was a new manager, somebody
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.080]   didn't know what was going on, but he goes in and charges his phone every day.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.120]   He's almost got walked on dressed like Jesus.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.480]   He has a big wooden cross.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480]   Everybody knows him.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.480]   He's harmless.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.320]   But they actually got him arrested, which did nothing but raise his profile and he got
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.600]   to speak to more people about being Philly Jesus.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.200]   To your point, I know I was yelling at you, but I'm kind of joking.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.240]   They're doing it all to sell things and to make more money.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240]   Yeah, it's all marketing.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.920]   I said, they're really great at marketing and invoking a feeling.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.360]   Like I said, if you listen to the way she was talking, she was pleasant and she was happy
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.920]   and it invigorated the motion.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.080]   That's what they do.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.440]   And as far as letting the homeless people in, they need to, but I highly doubt they will.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.600]   Of course they're not.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.320]   I had that incident in my own incident with Apple and Sandy.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.320]   Was that four runner?
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.720]   Yeah, in LA.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.560]   So Apple is, you know, they're going to have to tip toe around that because the Philly thing
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.560]   got a lot of buzz out here.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.400]   People were upset because again, it's something that the guy did every day and they actually
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.960]   let him go in there and charge his phone.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.200]   They didn't do anything about him.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.200]   They had to, I guess they have a time limit or something how much time you can spend in
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.640]   the store if you're not doing something.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.200]   I just think this is.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.880]   They probably don't unless like they probably noticed that he didn't look the way that they
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.040]   were hoping that he looked.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.520]   So that's kind of my point, which is.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.440]   I hung out for a full day in an Apple store.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.440]   They said nothing.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440]   Yeah, of course not.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.760]   That's my point is that you're welcome as long as you're part of the cult and you're
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:20.240]   kind of in the, in the, but if you look like you're, you know, a little weird by by, I
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.240]   don't know.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.240]   I just feel like it's a, it's nice.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.240]   All right.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.240]   Isn't that, isn't that every store though?
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.240]   Isn't that every place you know?
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.240]   No, it's fine.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.240]   If you don't have yourself put together to check out.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.240]   Or they don't want to.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.240]   I think they don't want to.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.240]   They don't want to.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.240]   I think they don't want to.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.240]   Well, it's a pussy.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240]   Well, or something.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.240]   I don't know.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.240]   And then they got players.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.240]   I was like, well, look at that.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.240]   This place, it's already looking more well.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.240]   Oh, see?
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:41.240]   Welcome to the Apple Grove.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.240]   Now we feel it.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.240]   We feel it.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.880]   But yeah, I think it's great marketing.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.520]   I think it's going to work well for them.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:52.120]   I think that it's a nice idea to be able to have a store where it's not unwelcoming and
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.720]   hopefully it'll be welcoming to everyone.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.440]   I doubt that that'll be the case to that.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.840]   But yeah, I like the idea of it just being open.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840]   You can just walk in.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.840]   You don't have to worry.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.220]   It's not going to be one of those stores where you feel like you go in and everyone's
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:08.040]   staring at you and you're not able to enter there and be able to just chill out.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.280]   I think it'll be great for their brand.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.880]   And yeah, they do this for marketing for sure.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.880]   Apple doesn't do that anyway.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.960]   You just, I mean, there's people always in there playing with games and apps and stuff.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.640]   And they're never really trying to sell you anything or help you with anything else.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.080]   You ask them because there's 42 million people just floating about.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.080]   So it's already there.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.080]   Again, it's just something else to market for them and say, oh, look what we're doing
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.200]   now because you haven't come into an Apple store in the last three years and our numbers
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.800]   are down and we're going to launch this new thing to get you back in.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.140]   I dropped my three year old off at the iPad table and I just go to work and...
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.140]   Exactly.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.140]   Exactly.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.140]   It's daycare.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.140]   Daycare for the tech app.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.140]   Can we do that?
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.980]   Can we do that as a Fox and Friends thing?
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:49.700]   Like just set up some go-capped, some go-fros and you just drop the camera and just see how
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.540]   long it takes for their like look.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.140]   It's been here for four hours.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.780]   Can we got a sip of your copper something like so much?
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:56.780]   I don't know.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.780]   I hate the fuck breath.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.660]   Yeah, let's see how long they notice.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.660]   Four hours?
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:01.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.480]   That's what screen time?
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.160]   I actually, I forgot.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.400]   There is one more Google thing.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   What?
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.440]   There's one more Google thing.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.620]   I do want to mention is that they announced that Chromebooks are going to be running the
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.800]   Android store soon.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.800]   That's amazing.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.800]   I think that's interesting.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.120]   Does that excite you Owen?
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.800]   That pleases me to no end especially like if I can use Instagram on the computer instead
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.120]   of having to use my phone.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.120]   Oh, happy day.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.200]   I'm buying me a new laptop ASAP.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.920]   It makes the Chromebook very interesting and they did mention that it's selling more now
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.960]   than they sold last quarter more Chromebooks were sold than Apple Macintosh's.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.560]   Well, they're probably selling a lot of those to schools and things like that.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.560]   They are.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.120]   It's like it's the number one computer in schools now.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.120]   Leah's school just got a whole new crop of them and they went, they used to have the old
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.480]   Dell desktop things that were just horrible and then they always just put on new Chromebooks.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.920]   So everybody's got a Chromebook now.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:04.680]   So I'm sure they're killing it in the educational market.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.280]   What is the future of Chrome OS?
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.200]   Well, I feel like this is the future.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.840]   In other words, the more the questions, what's the future of Android in some ways, right?
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:18.280]   Because although I guess you still need Android for a touch device, a phone or actually,
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.680]   you know, here's what the question is Clayton.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.280]   What's the future for tablets?
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.360]   My wife was Lisa was asking me this is, well, are they going to still sell tablets?
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:31.400]   If you can get Android apps on your Chromebook, what do you need a tablet for?
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.840]   Because you don't want a keyboard and you don't and you want the touchscreen, you want
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.840]   the portability.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.920]   I mean, having a Chromebook is cool and all but the whole reason tablets are awesome is
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.280]   because I don't have a keyboard attached to it.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280]   Somebody said.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280]   I want to go.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280]   I take my tablet.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   I don't dislodge my laptop.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280]   Even even my air.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   I got an air sitting right here too.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.520]   I barely even take this thing out anymore unless I'm traveling.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.000]   You see, I'm on the opposite.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.840]   Now I don't use my tablet anymore because like my MacBook, it's like it's been and almost
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.160]   as light as a tablet, but I appreciate the keyboard.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:04.840]   If I have to write, you know, a long email tapping on glass is just does not do it for
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.760]   me and I hate having to carry the tablets.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.360]   Like they do have the light ones, but I liked having a trackpad.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.200]   I just want it to be able to do all of it.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.400]   I want the touchscreen, the keyboard, it all there and to be light and to be able to travel
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   with it.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.400]   So now I use my tablet at all.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.400]   Does it make a difference?
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   It's a different touchscreen on your Apple though.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   You don't have a touchscreen on your Apple.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.400]   I know.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   That's why I'm waiting for it.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.400]   I'm waiting for it.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.120]   And that's what we were so in sync today and then you had to go and ruin the day.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.000]   Apple's never going to put a touchscreen on it.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   They don't want to.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.320]   They're already losing market share to the iPad.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.400]   It feels like there's more greenery than there used to be here.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400]   We love Leo.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400]   Where is Leo?
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.400]   It's a pretty drastic heart.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.600]   Leo the forest.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.880]   Do you feel better now Owen?
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.000]   Are you feeling a little more at home in the Grove?
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.400]   Do you know why I feel better?
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.400]   Why?
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.880]   It's hard every time Georgia giggles when they put you on screen.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:53.880]   Of course I feel better.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.400]   She's my Chewbacca mom for right now and I'm enjoying the heck out of it.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400]   This weekend weekend.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.720]   I'm just able to find Leo.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.080]   Actually speaking of the Chewbacca mom, don't you have one of those masks Clayton?
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.080]   Did you get it?
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.080]   What?
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   Did you?
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.080]   Ah!
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.080]   Ah!
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.080]   Oh my God that's terrifying.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:24.080]   Did you laugh maniacally for us?
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:29.240]   Oh it hurts.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.800]   It's a little too tight.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   I love it.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   I love it.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.040]   Can you wear the mask and go drown around with it?
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.560]   By the way we tried the D.W.B. experience.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.800]   We desperately tried to get those.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:46.600]   See listen to her laugh.
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.600]   I'm just drinking.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.000]   She's like the Chewbacca mom.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   People listening.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   I was like, "I was like, "You're into my talk at the same time."
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.920]   Leo just removed his shirt.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.600]   Well I don't think that really explains the whole...
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   Leo has removed his shirt.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.640]   The totality of the experience frankly.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.600]   He looks like...
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.600]   The hair shampoo.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.600]   What is it?
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.600]   It begins with the N.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.600]   This naturally...
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.600]   It's taking a photo.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.600]   We've got to remember this moment.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.600]   What is that hair shampoo?
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.600]   Where the girl puts it on and she turns it to a jungle and she's having the time of her
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.600]   life.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.600]   Oh yeah.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.600]   What is that?
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.600]   I know what you're talking about.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.600]   That's new.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.600]   Nature's...
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.600]   Oh my God.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.600]   Herbal essence.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.600]   Herbal essence.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.600]   Leo LaPorte looks like he's an herbal essence commercial.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.600]   He is waiting for the shower scene to start.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:46.600]   Around about flowers and trees and foliage and a microphone.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.600]   He's a silver fox in the woods.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.600]   He is a silver fox.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.600]   I'm going to know what people that just tune in at this point.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.600]   They're going to be like, "I'm going to go on a show."
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.600]   I feel that I have now...
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:08.600]   I'm channeling Johnny Ive and I really want to have kind of a twit-glade, a twit-forest.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:13.600]   And by the way, you're laughing but the entire studio audience is also disrobed.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.600]   Now who's running a foliage core?
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.600]   Every Sunday they got naked with you.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.600]   You got plants all around.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   Welcome to the new Twit Call.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   This is the new Twit.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.600]   It's the new Twit Call.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.600]   So we're going to take a break.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600]   Is this a snapchat?
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.600]   I'm living in Snapchat.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.600]   I feel I'm living.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.600]   I feel like I'm not...
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.600]   I'm trying to...
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:44.600]   I just need Clayton to wear a mask and ride around the hood with me and see if we get a D.W.B. show going on.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.600]   Two brothers in the hood.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.600]   Two brothers in the hood.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.600]   And then let's see if they pull you over.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.600]   It's the new thing driving while Chewbacca.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.600]   Just keep on going.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.600]   It's very risky.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.600]   Snap.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.600]   This is the Snapchat Twit.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.600]   Snapchat filter.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.600]   Did you know that I ordered a unicorn that farts rainbows, by the way?
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.600]   Are you kidding?
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.600]   No, it was a Kickstarter.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.600]   Toots.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.600]   You know about toots.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.600]   I do.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.600]   I have to look up toots now.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.600]   I've got the golden one coming.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:17.600]   Twit.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.600]   T-W-O-T-Z, right?
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.600]   The unicorn on Kickstarter.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:23.600]   And it's tied to my Twitter account.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.600]   So whenever anybody...
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.600]   I don't know, we can make it whatever we want.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:31.600]   Like whenever anybody says something nice or whatever it'll fart rainbows.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:40.600]   Anyway, that goes right alongside my floating bonsai tree that I also buy the stupidest
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.600]   stuff I can start.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.600]   Please visit Amazon.com to trap or manage it.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.600]   Is that an echo in your pants?
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.600]   Yes.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:22:00.600]   I don't know what my staff has done to me, but it doesn't feel quite right.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.600]   You know...
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]   Gazelle.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.600]   Thank you.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.600]   Gazelle.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:14.600]   Gazelle is a great place to go, both to buy and to sell your gadgets.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:18.600]   You know, if you have a bunch of gadgets sitting around, as we do in the basement, by the way,
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:24.600]   it's like putting hundred dollar bills in drawers and chests and boxes, just letting them gather dust.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.600]   You wouldn't do that.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.600]   That would be crazy talk.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:31.600]   Well, that's what you're doing.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:38.600]   If you're not going to Gazelle and selling your old gadgets, go to gazelle.com right now.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:45.600]   Get a quote on your iPhone, your iPad, your Samsung, your Surface tablet, your Kindle tablets.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.600]   They will give you a top dollar.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.600]   By the way, there's no commitment.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:50.600]   You go, you get a quote.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.600]   You've got 30 days to take advantage of it.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.600]   So you just find out.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.600]   Just find out.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.600]   You say, "Okay, I'm going to check out."
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600]   They send you a box.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.600]   They pay the postage at anything worth more than a box, which is almost everything.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.600]   Even broken iPads and iPhones are worth something, Gazelle.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.600]   And they will send you a box.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.600]   And then they turn it around fast.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.600]   If you forget to wipe your data, don't worry.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.600]   They'll do that for you.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.600]   They'll also check the quality.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.600]   And sometimes, and this has happened to me now twice, they will up the offer.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.600]   They said, "No, no, no, it's whatever.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.600]   Better memory, more memory than you said, or it's better quality than you said."
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.000]   And they will up the offer, which is, they have no obligation to do so, but they do it.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.240]   They're very honest.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.720]   And you're going to get a great price.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.880]   Then they'll send you a check, or if you want to write away a PayPal credit, or if you're
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.360]   the savvy shopper, get an Amazon gift card because they will bump that up by 5%.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.160]   So it's an extra 5% for you.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.480]   So that's how it works to sell it, Gazelle.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.040]   But you might ask, "Well, what happens to the stuff they buy?"
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:47.240]   Well, the very best stuff they sell on Gazelle.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:53.480]   So it's a great place to get slightly, gently, pre-used, pre-owned devices.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:58.000]   They sell iPhones, iPads, and Samsung devices at Gazelle.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.800]   You can get an iPhone 6s, a 6s plus, an iPad, Samsung Galaxy phone.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.760]   Every one of them fully inspected back by a 30-day return policy sold without carrier
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.760]   contract.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.760]   But yes, of course, they work on all the major carriers in the US.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:15.040]   Three, six, or 12-month payments too now with a firm, which is really nice.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.680]   It's just a checkbox to check out, say, "I want to finance this with a firm and they'll
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.120]   do that too for you."
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.840]   They also offer 12-month warranties and cell phones and iPads powered by assurance solutions.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.040]   And these are great warranties.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:29.400]   They cover water damage, cracked screens.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400]   It's awesome.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.400]   Gazelle.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.400]   To buy or to sell, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, Gazelle.com.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:41.360]   Give it a try today and we thank them so much for their support.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.000]   This week in tech.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.240]   We talked about Android on Google.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:50.440]   That's going to come later this year.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:55.560]   But if you have one of three devices, including the latest Chromebook Pixel, you could turn
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.680]   on developer mode and get that starting next month.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.440]   I did that immediately.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.920]   Stop taking pictures.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.640]   And no, I'm just kidding.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640]   Take all the pictures you want.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.120]   You want me to stand up?
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.560]   Someone in the chat putter was this logo over you.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:14.080]   Oh, that's the least of it.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.080]   I like what I have what Georgia is having.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.080]   That looks good.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:22.080]   Well, my thought process was this show is the nightmares of a padded room, Georgia Dow,
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.080]   in tech.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.080]   This is what she gave up.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.080]   This is your dream.
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.080]   None of this.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.600]   This now seems more like that.
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.600]   Yes.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.600]   This is exactly what it is.
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.600]   I said it at the top.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.400]   We have morphed into your mind.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.400]   You're not going to remember any of these.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.400]   And I need out.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.600]   Hey, let me ask you, Georgia, because I know I'm always covered.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.360]   This Apple has pulled back its iPad update.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.520]   What was that iOS 9.2.3?
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.520]   Was it?
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.320]   Because it was breaking iPads?
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   Yes.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.320]   We didn't install.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.280]   I wait until everyone else.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.280]   I had to have a hat.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.280]   I feel like I'm left out.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.280]   No, you look good.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.280]   I think you're fitting in.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.280]   Clayton has Chewbacca.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.280]   Yeah, you got a hat.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.280]   Oh, and just has the eyebrows.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.280]   Oh, and it's just Owen.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.080]   Owen doesn't need to do more than that.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:06.440]   You look like you're about to go into Forest Hunt for Uncle Leo.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.440]   I think so.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.440]   I think so.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.960]   Well, you look if he's in danger all head on out.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.240]   Yeah, so I always wait, though.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:19.600]   I always wait for any update till Renee like has already like vetted it for me.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.200]   So I let it break all of his stuff.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.600]   I put it on my iPad right away.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.400]   It didn't do anything bad in my iPad.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.400]   So I don't know.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:31.400]   Anyway, they say a very small number of people have had that happen.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.880]   But there you go.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:34.880]   There's a fix on its way.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.080]   I never update myself on the first update.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.080]   Never.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.440]   I had a problem like two years ago with an update.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:45.000]   So now at least wait a week, see what grows through and then to get that secondary to
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   your update because somebody was arguing with me.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.320]   They're saying what Apple has all this R&D?
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.320]   Why can't they fix this before they send it out?
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.360]   And I said, well, the infinite multitude of things are on people's phones.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.920]   One app might affect the update.
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:59.680]   Something else might affect the update that they can't plan for.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.760]   So they do the best they can as a general surface.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:07.360]   And then oh, 30% of population has this goofy app that affects the update in this way.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.640]   They patch it, they fix it.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.920]   So it is what it is.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.520]   I just let other people be my guinea pig.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.960]   I don't need to be first and first and first on anything like that anymore.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.840]   I don't want to have to deal with those issues.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.960]   What's the count, by the way, on that Facebook Live lady?
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:19.960]   How high?
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:20.960]   How high did that go?
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.960]   120 million.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:22.960]   Wow.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.640]   In like two days, right?
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.000]   It was at 91 million yesterday morning.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.320]   You had her on, right?
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.400]   Yeah, we had her on the show.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.480]   Her name was Candice.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.040]   Is she normal or is she weird?
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.040]   She's normal.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:39.040]   You can't ask that wearing a wig.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.320]   We said somewhere in a wig.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320]   George, are you on something?
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.320]   It's really, really normal.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.080]   When I thought about what Twitter would be like, it wasn't like this.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.080]   This is so much fun.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:51.800]   This isn't your dream come true.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:57.080]   I think this is my favorite Twitter so far.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.520]   So you, by the way, did Cole's bring you that Clayton?
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.960]   Because I tried to get one.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.960]   You can't get them.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   They're sold out everywhere.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.480]   No, my son, this is my son's.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:11.400]   So the other night, my producers texted me Friday night and said, "They know me because
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.400]   I'm the nerd guy."
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.400]   They know you'd have one, right?
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.400]   Do you have a Chewbacca mask?
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.440]   As a matter of fact.
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.320]   I wish I'd done it.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.160]   My son had it up in his toy chest.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.160]   He goes to bed like 738 o'clock.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.320]   So he's up there, fooling around.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   He should have been in bed.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:29.400]   And I hear, you know, I creep into his room and he's sitting there like he's fooling around
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.520]   and I'm like, "Hey buddy, can I borrow your Chewbacca mask?"
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.880]   He's like, "Daddy, Daddy, why?"
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.480]   I said, "I need to take it to work tomorrow."
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.480]   He's like, "Oh, why?"
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:38.680]   I said, "Well, I need to wear it on the show tomorrow."
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:41.960]   He said, "Okay, is it going to be stuck in your office where you bring it back home?"
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   Oh my.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.120]   So, yeah, we had her on, she's totally normal.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.120]   But yeah, this is amazing.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:51.480]   So this video has broken the record for the most watched video in Facebook history.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.480]   Wow.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.480]   And I didn't, you know, I would have thought.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.480]   Is it only the live?
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.920]   Isn't it only they broke the live record?
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.920]   Yeah, probably.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.920]   90.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:28:59.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.000]   It was over a hundred million last time I looked.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.880]   Yeah, this morning it was 91.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.800]   Now it's 120 million.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.040]   And of course, Kohl's, you can't get publicity like this, a viral video like this.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:18.600]   They gave her a whole bunch of masks and what was it, $500 in Kohl's cards?
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.440]   They really ought to give her more if you ask me.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.840]   You know what stuff you can give for $500 of Kohl's?
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.840]   You can stop filming.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:25.840]   I know.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:26.840]   They gave her, like what did they give her?
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.240]   Like 10,000 Kohl's points, which actually is pretty good.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.560]   Yeah, I mean, you know, the year of shop for free for that.
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.160]   So how much did Miles pay for that?
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.320]   Because it's now selling for $75 on eBay.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.320]   But eBay?
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.560]   I don't, I think it was like under 20 bucks.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.560]   30?
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560]   30?
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:48.160]   30 years as a allowance and, isn't that a starting bid?
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.160]   That's not the final bidder.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.160]   That's the buy.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.160]   No, that's a buy it now, bid.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.160]   Wow.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.160]   They've sold more than 49%.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.640]   It says, I'm surprised at the two of these.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.640]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:59.200]   The postage is 15 bucks.
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.640]   I remember during the holidays, it was a, it was a, you know, they had that commercial,
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.240]   that target commercial that showed it where the dad and the son had a bond together.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.320]   Oh, I don't remember that.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.920]   Somebody's making some money on these.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:12.920]   Hasbro.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:13.920]   It's a Hasbro product.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:19.480]   And it's, it just shows you, you can't, you can think as long as hard as you want.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:24.720]   And making a viral video cannot be, yeah, this is the, this is the actual video.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.720]   You probably shouldn't show it too long because people are getting really sick of it.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720]   But it's very funny.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.960]   She puts the mask on and she laughs, you know, if you haven't seen it, if you're one of the
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:37.160]   five people hasn't seen it, she laughs up, ruriously for minutes.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.240]   And it was, did you ask her Clayton?
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.840]   She didn't think she wasn't trying to make a viral video.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.280]   She was just, you know, she was buying this.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.720]   She thought it, she loved Star Wars.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.520]   She, she was sending this to her friends.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.360]   She just wanted to see what her friends reaction was.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.320]   And she just, so she was live, you know, interacting with her friends and she's like,
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.320]   well, I'm going to put this on.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.320]   And she, she just thought it was hilarious looking seeing herself like in the mirror.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.640]   And she just thought it looked ridiculous.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.200]   And it just exploded.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.000]   I asked her, you know, what the response has been.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.760]   And, and, you know, people have just been writing her like this crazy nice stuff, like
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.320]   her one woman said her autistic daughter hasn't laughed in years.
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.520]   And this is the first time that she's laughed.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   Like those types of things like one person said, you know, I've been suffering from depression
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.760]   and anxiety.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.400]   And this was the first thing that made me laugh.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.920]   And she's like, we just need more laughter in this world.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:24.920]   And that was like her message.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:25.920]   I was like, that's great.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:26.920]   It's exactly what we need.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.200]   You know, what's cool is she just laughs.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.040]   I'll show, I'll show a little bit of it.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.160]   She's, and it's a genuine, Jared, we were talking about this.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.400]   It's a genuine laugh.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.200]   You don't feel like it's, it's fake.
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.760]   No.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.880]   But you can't, you couldn't pure joy.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.480]   Yeah, you couldn't make that up.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.640]   I mean, you couldn't invent that, could you?
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:50.160]   You couldn't say, oh, let's make it, Coles couldn't say, let's, let's make a viral video
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.160]   like that.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:55.280]   No, people try and then there's such a backlash when people find out that it's viral, like
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.280]   they've been duped.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.280]   No, I hate that.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.280]   There's something nice about this.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:00.920]   I think a lot of people thought this was fake, actually.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.480]   The other story here is Facebook Live.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:09.480]   And yeah, and of course, the Facebook news this week, but you know, like Facebook Live
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:13.280]   now being ubiquitous instead of it just being like, you know, celebrities and tied to their
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:20.120]   pages and so forth, the real push into live video for Facebook, what it means for businesses,
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:25.040]   what it means for individuals, you know, where Periscope, I don't think really ever got the
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.080]   attraction to something like Facebook could have.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:31.800]   And YouTube, quite frankly, doesn't have doesn't have the gravitas that Facebook Live
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.400]   is probably going to have.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.040]   Are you guys is Fox considering doing a lot of Facebook stuff?
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:41.640]   You know, before shows after shows, I know one of our weekday guys, he does radio for
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:44.200]   three hours after he gets off for the morning show.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.160]   So he'll he'll kind of do live.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.360]   I know he's a workhorse.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.720]   So he'll do like a Facebook Live before he goes on the air, kind of like teasing what's
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.440]   coming up and sort of interacting.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.240]   And so there's a lot of that.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.440]   You know, I do four hours of live TV.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.520]   And so the last thing I want to do is like jump on and do extra things later.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:09.360]   But I think there's definitely the traffic that our pages get is just through the roof.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.360]   I mean, it's bond.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.360]   So really works.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360]   Yeah, it really works.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.200]   And because it's tied to Nielsen ratings, you have to remember it's weighted, right?
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.080]   It's not it's not a one to one.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:23.880]   So viewership to social media interaction, but obviously people, the social media interaction,
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:26.960]   Facebook and Twitter and so forth is weighted and all of that.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.600]   So it's possible for shows that don't have as much of a viewership to then capitalize
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:37.680]   on their social media following and help them in their overall Nielsen ratings.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.680]   How is it?
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.040]   So I don't understand how it's tied to Nielsen ratings.
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:44.200]   Well, Nielsen, it I don't know the exact-
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.200]   What do you laugh at?
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.200]   What?
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.200]   I was going to leave.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.800]   You didn't just think something weird happened, did you?
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800]   Like, were you seeing-
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.600]   I'm still checking the walls.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.600]   Are you good?
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.600]   What happened to Puck?
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.600]   Puck out of here.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:09.960]   So you know, I know that movie companies, for instance, are paying stars more if they
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.760]   have a larger Twitter following, although that seems to me kind of dumb, but they do,
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.760]   right?
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.120]   Because it's seen as such a huge marketing tool.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.520]   Well, it's not dumb because they're-
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.960]   Well, if they're real, if it's real.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:25.760]   It's not- so first of all, it's more real than anybody else is going to be real because
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.080]   enough dummies want to know what the Kardashians are doing over what the president of the
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.080]   United States is doing.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:31.320]   So let's just start off with that.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.320]   It's real, okay?
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.320]   It's real.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:34.320]   So when Kevin Hart comes in-
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.840]   Oh, but some people buy their Twitter followers.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.480]   Well, that's what I mean, is it?
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:38.480]   Yeah, I mean-
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.560]   Yeah, there's a whole bunch of people that like, you know, have 50,000 Twitter followers.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.560]   Okay.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:44.560]   Let me- okay.
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.880]   So out of the bubble, into the real world, we're talking about superstardance celebrities
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.600]   and the money they get paid because they're their own marketing company.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.600]   Right.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.600]   So- Okay, some point.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.240]   Kevin Hart has 34 million people.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.240]   He goes into the- the negotiations-
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.240]   She has 34 million followers.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.240]   I don't know what it is.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.240]   He's got a lot of followers.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.240]   It's high.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.240]   It's really high.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.240]   It might even be that number.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:05.360]   So he goes into a deal and he says, all right, I want to get paid this for the movie.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.320]   How much additional are you going to give me for marketing?
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.160]   And they said, well, why would we give you anything for marketing?
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.280]   And he's like, well, you have a marketing budget, right?
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.280]   He's like, yeah.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:17.400]   Okay, well, on my last movie, I drove this XA numbers to videos and promos and things
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.480]   that I'm going to be doing.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.960]   And that's extra out of my time.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.760]   So if you're going to pay a promotional company, I got more than this fake promotional PR company
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.000]   that you got going on.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.400]   And I'm the product.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.840]   So why not pay me that?
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:28.840]   And at first they snubbed them.
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.320]   He said, all right, well, I'm not going to work with you.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320]   Then they came back.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:32.320]   They paid no money.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   And guess what?
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.600]   Him and the cast do things like where they go and they buy a whole movie theater or a city
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.800]   tickets and pay for all their tickets and they go sit down with them.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.960]   They watch the movie and they pop up and Kevin Hart's like, oh, how'd you like the movie?
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.240]   Everybody gets their picture taken with him and the other cast members are all over the
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.240]   city doing it.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.720]   There's promotion that's real and organic that they could do as opposed to the stupid,
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.720]   oh, four out of eight people said that the guy was a real dinosaur.
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:58.280]   So again, celebrities have real numbers and they can rule real real units.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.800]   Like it's legit.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.560]   By the way, you were right on.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.720]   This is Kevin Hart's page.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:05.560]   He's got almost 30 million, almost exactly 30 million followers.
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.400]   And look at the big ad for his latest, but you know what's the funniest thing?
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.920]   There's a fake Kevin Hart who has a million followers.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:13.920]   It's good.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:14.920]   It's good.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:15.920]   It's the overflow traffic.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:16.920]   Yes, the overflow.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.960]   Well, to answer your question, you know, you know, Nielsen rolled out their social content
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:22.960]   ratings.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.560]   I think it was last year 2015, but it was just Twitter.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.560]   Oh, interesting.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:27.560]   Twitter.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.880]   And then in January of this year, Nielsen rolled out.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.880]   They added Facebook.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:31.880]   Half to.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.480]   So, you know, I think it's a lot of people who are watching these programs, but they're
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.840]   saying is like obviously 60% of people who are watching these programs are sitting there
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.320]   with some sort of tablet advice while they're watching these shows and they're interacting
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.320]   with them.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.400]   They're on Facebook, you know, and if certainly if you like the Phillies or something like
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.400]   that, if there's a Phillies game that's live, it allows you to, you know, interact
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.400]   in that way.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:58.360]   But they're looking at the overall tweets, mentions, at replies, likes, engagement during
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360]   those programs.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.680]   That social content ratings are weighted in your overall, your overall Nielsen ratings.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.680]   So you can look at that.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.760]   If you're a show that doesn't maybe have as much viewership, but you've got a really rabid
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.040]   fan base online on Facebook who people are jumping in and really talking about your show
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:18.360]   live, that can be really powerful to help move the needle.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.360]   Very interesting.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.320]   And he's got 35 million on Instagram.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.320]   Wow.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.240]   Like I said, and when you look at his videos or whatever, his central intelligence has
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:31.040]   645,000 views.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.240]   I have to think a lot.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.240]   I mean, yes, of course, probably half of those are spammers and bots and stuff, but
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.920]   that's still even if it's half 15 million.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.000]   Again, is a significant number.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.640]   And the people that are directly plugged into the content.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.360]   People watching Twitter right now don't care about me.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.600]   They're here for you.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.880]   I'm just a byproduct of enjoy enlightenment.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.400]   And no, they're here for you.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.520]   Don't make make no mistake about that.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:54.880]   Man, I'm the only adult here today.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.320]   So I'm going to take it when I can get it because normally it's me with the cow guy taking
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.160]   me away in the mask and the wigs and the hair steps.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.280]   Today is my day to be an adult.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.680]   I'm so happy to be it.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:07.680]   It's overrated.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.680]   It's overrated, Owen.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:09.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:10.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.680]   I got all the pictures with the Joy of the Forge mask.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.680]   Oh, did you just say that?
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.680]   That was a good picture.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.800]   When I put that when I was yelling to you about VR and I put the headphones on and then
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.280]   somebody made the headphones with the.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.880]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.880]   No.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.680]   There's a headset with micro.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:25.680]   That's when you were on Twitter last time.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.680]   You tilt it down.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.880]   Somebody's like, you are from the future.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.040]   Oh, doctor, somebody made that thing you're joking about.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.680]   I'm like, see, it's all in here.
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:37.960]   Hey, do you think Kevin Hart tweets for himself or does he have a social media team?
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.040]   He tweets for himself.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.040]   That's the key.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.760]   I mean, I look at people like Trump.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.360]   Clearly Trump's writing his own tweets.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.680]   Honestly, he wouldn't pay somebody to write those.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:39:01.240]   Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, the people who really do work it do better, don't they, than the
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.240]   people who fake it?
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:04.480]   Well, people want to be a part of this.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.480]   This is great.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.080]   It builds community and when people feel apart.
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.080]   How hard is it?
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.960]   It's been, you know, they're going to spend more money towards those products, like the
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:12.960]   Apple store.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:13.960]   And it's not hard to do.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.120]   I mean, after all, it's just 140 characters.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.360]   Well, probably there's a lot of a replies.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.920]   I open up my Twitter when there's something happening and I get like, you know, if I have
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:27.560]   like 35 people replied to me being Canadian, I want to reply to everyone.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560]   You're nice.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.560]   I find slightly overwhelmed.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.880]   Yeah, I like, you know, I don't have that many people.
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:33.880]   It's Snapchat.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.240]   Snapchat is being used that way too, isn't it, by the movie stars?
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.320]   Hart has a Snapchat.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.320]   Yeah, everybody's snapping.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.400]   George Takei is the counter example, right?
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:48.960]   I mean, he's a, he's a fun, that's an interesting example because he's fun to follow, but it's
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.360]   clearly a name and say it.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.520]   It's his team and they're finding a lot of viral videos.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.880]   So you follow him because of the content, but it doesn't really build his brand, doesn't.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:39:59.880]   It does.
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:00.880]   It still does.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.880]   Okay.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:07.240]   So being organic is great and all the whole world isn't Kevin Hart charismatic and some
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.160]   people need help with certain things.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.480]   So if you have a good team that curates things that are about you and they're on message,
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:14.760]   people are fine with that too.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:19.640]   But what they don't like is you got a robo tweet coming out to says, Hey, I learned how
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.320]   to bake 12 cookies yesterday.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:25.520]   And there was a mass shooting 15 seconds ago and you're on this auto bot just tweeting
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.520]   out stupid stuff.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:28.520]   That's what people.
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:29.520]   There's the real risk.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.520]   That's the difference when you find that.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:36.040]   I have no problem with you having a team, Ramani, Malco or whoever and or he's doing itself
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.040]   or whoever's doing it, but I just want it to be you authentic, at least in your team.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:42.360]   So you said, okay, this is what we're going to do.
